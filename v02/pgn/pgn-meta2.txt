pgn-meta2.txt
Feb 15, 2018

This supercedes pgn-meta.txt as a description of 
 the current digitization pgn.txt.

The digitization is in the utf-8 encoding.

pgn.txt contains digitization of the entries, along with the many other
sections.
The following descriptions generally apply to the entry sections only, not
to the other sections. 

The {X...X} style of coding serves several purposes:
{%X%}  : italic text 
{#X#}  : Devanagari text in slp1 transcoding. 
{??}   : Unreadable text. 4 instances.

The pseudo-xml <> style of coding is used as follows:

<L>,<e>,<h>,<k1>,<k2>,<pc>,<LEND> are used in the 'meta lines' (see below) 

Types of line break divisions appear in the entries:
<div n="lb"/>  Line break (removed 12-14-2021)
<div n="P"/>   Line break with indentation
<div n="HI"/>  Indented paragraph

Meta lines: 
Each entry of the digitization is contained within a beginning and ending
markup. As example,

<L>1<pc>020<k1>gupta<k2>gupta
1. {%Gupta:%}¦ (No. 1, L. 28; No. 21, L. 4; No. 22, L. 1; No. 47,
<div n="lb"/>L. 1; No. 49, L. 1; No. 50, L. 1; No. 51, L. 2, L. 4;
<div n="lb"/>No. 53, L. 1):
<div n="lb"/>He was the founder of the family. We have already discussed
<div n="lb"/>his name.
<LEND>

The ending markup is <LEND>.
The beginning markup contains various identifying fields, expressed in
a <fieldname>fieldvalue format. The fields are:
required fields
  L Cologne record identifier
  pc page-col reference to scanned image
  k1 key1. The headword spelling, in slp1 coding for Sanskrit headwords
  k2 key2. same as k1 for this dictionary.
optional field for homonym
  h The homonym number (nor present in pgn.txt). 

Page breaks are coded as [Page...].
The general form of page breaks is [PageX+ n],
where 'n' is the number of following lines in page 'X'.
X has several forms:
(a) title-Y , where Y is a lower-case roman numeral from 'i' to 'xxviii' (1 to 28)
(b) -PPP where PPP is a 0-filled number sequence, from 001 to 360.
(c) -Y, where Y is an upper-case roman numeral from 'I' to 'X'
(d) PPP-c , where PPP is page number and 'c' is a column ('a' or 'b').
    ppp goes from 361 to 378
(e) -PPP where PPP is page number from 379 to 382

The lines of the digitization generally represent lines of the text.

While this text is not a dictionary, we have identified many (484, as of
this writing) sections of the
text as if they were dictionary entries. The headwords for these entries are
not in a dictionary alphabetical order.

Most Sanskrit words within the entries are presented in modern IAST form, as 
described in  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration.

This generally agrees with the printed text, except:
We use 'ṃ' for anusvara, instead of the author's ṁ.

The extended ascii characters appearing in the digitization, along
with their frequency as of 02-15-2018, are:
