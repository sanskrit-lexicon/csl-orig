gra-meta2.txt
Jan 24, 2018

This supercedes gra-meta.txt as a description of 
 the current digitization gra.txt.

The digitization is in the utf-8 encoding.

The {X...X} style of coding serves several purposes:
{@X@}  : bold text
{%X%}  : italic text 
{nnn,n...}  Identify RV links. (04-06-2021)

The pseudo-xml <> style of coding is used as follows:

<L>,<e>,<h>,<k1>,<k2>,<pc>,<LEND> are used in the 'meta lines' (see below) 
<lang n="greek">X</lang>        X in Greek unicode (X currently empty - not coded)
<div n="H">   A major subdivision
<div n="P">   A minor subdivision
<div n="P1">  A more minor subdivision
<F>X</F>      footnote (only 1 instance)

Meta lines: 
Each entry of the digitization is contained within a beginning and ending
markup. As example,
<L>2<pc>0001<k1>a<k2>a<h>2
2. ({@a@})¦. Deutestamm der 1. Person, siehe unter ahám.
<LEND>


The ending markup is <LEND>.
The beginning markup contains various identifying fields, expressed in
a <fieldname>fieldvalue format. The fields are:
required fields
  L Cologne record identifier
  pc page-col reference to scanned image
  k1 key1. The headword spelling, in slp1 coding for Sanskrit headwords
  k2 key2. The original headword spelling, either in slp1 or IAST
optional field for homonym
  h The homonym number (usually a digit). 

Page breaks are coded as [Page...].
Page breaks are more specifically coded as
[PageP] where P goes from 1 to 1686
Some pages have two parts, and the 2nd parts are indicated with an 'a':
 505a, 506a, 757a, 758a, 1365a, 1366a.

Words using diacritics with the Latin alphabet are represented in Unicode 
characters. The vast majority of such words with diacritics are Sanskrit, 
and of course some words are German.  But there are are also a smaller number
of words in other languages.   
The spelling aims to be modern IAST unicode,
generally as described in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration; the usage of diacritics in the printed text has many differences from
the modern IAST appearing in this version of the digitization.

Here are the extended ASCII characters that occur in the text.
with their  frequency as of this writing (01-24-2018):
