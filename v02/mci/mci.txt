<H>FOREWORD
<P>It was but natural that, with the advance of scientific Indology, the need should
have been urgently felt for a critical edition of the {%Mahābhārata.%} In a paper
presented at the 11th International Congress of Orientalists held at Paris in 1897,
WINTERNITZ strongly voiced this need for a critical edition of the {%Mahābhārata%} as “a
{%sine qua non%} for all historical and critical research regarding the great epic of India”.
As the result of the persistent efforts in this regard of WINTERNITZ and several other
scholars, the International Union of Academies resolved in 1904 to undertake the prepara-
tion of such an edition. Funds were raised for this purpose, and a specimen of the
edition prepared by LÜDERS was also published for private circulation among scholars.
But then came the first world war which interrupted all scholastic activities in the West.
On the other hand, during the last years of the first world war, there began to become
evident in India a new spirit of independence which touched almost all spheres of
national life. Accordingly, the workers of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute,
which was founded in 1917 to commemorate the name and work of Ramakrishna Gopal
BHANDARKAR who had worthily come to be regarded as one of the leading pioneers of
scientific Orientology in India, decided, in their understandable enthusiasm, to venture
upon the project of a critical edition of the {%Mahābhārata%} making a fresh start, of course
with the collaboration, wherever possible, of their foreign colleagues.
<P>The first volume in the Institute's {%Critical Edition of the Mahābhārata,%} namely,
the {%Ādiparvan,%} edited by V. S. SUKTHANKAR, was published in 1933, and it soon
evoked quite an encouraging response. The critical edition of the eighteen {%parvans%} of
the {%Mahābhārata%} (extending over 13,000 demi quarto pages) was completed in 1966,
and this historic event was formally announced by Rashtrapati Dr. S. RADHAKRISHNAN
at a special function held at the Institute on September 22, 1966.
<P>It would seem that the Editorial Board and the Board of Referees for the
{%Critical Edition of the Mahābhārata%} had visualized it as a multifaceted project. Besides
the critical edition of the 18 {%parvans,%} it was to have comprised also a critical edition
of the {%Harivaṃśa,%} which is traditionally regarded as a {%khilaparvan%} of the {%Mahābhārata,%}
(later published in two volumes containing 1,711 pages, 1969-1971), the {%Pratīka-%}
{%Index%} (6 volumes containing 4,805 pages, 1967-1972), the {%Critically Constituted Text%}
{%of the Great Epic and the Harivaṃśa%} (5 volumes containing 3,150 pages, 1971-
1976), and the {%Epilogue of the Critical Edition of the Mahābhārata.%} This last
item, namely, the {%Epilogue,%} has had rather a chequered career. Even at an early
stage, it was thought that, as a prelude to the {%Epilogue,%} the Institute should publish a
fairly comprehensive analytical {%Cultural Index to the Critical Edition.%} This latter too
posed many problems, but the Institute duly overcame them. The work is now properly
[Page00-07+ 8]
organized, and it is hoped that the present first fascicule of the {%Cultural Index,%} which
the Institute has great pleasure in bringing out on the occasion of its {%Amṛtamahotsava,%}
will be followed by the subsequent fascicules in quick and regular succession.

<H>PREFACE
<P>In 1966 the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute completed its monumental
project of preparing and publishing the first ever critical edition of the {%Mahābhārata%}
<F>1. It has appeared in 19 volumes. The critical edition of the {%Harivaṃśa,%} which is regarded
as a {%khilaparvan%} of the {%Mahābhārata,%} appeared in two volumes in 1969.</F>,
a project on which three General Editors and seven {%parvan-%} Editors had steadily worked
for nearly half a century. In continuation of this major task the Institute subsequently
brought out two significant publications which went a long way in facilitating the use
of the critically edited text: (1) {%The Pratīka-Index of the Mahābhārata,%} being
a comprehensive index of the verse-quarters ({%ślokapādasūcī%}) occurring in the
edition of the {%Mahābhārata,%} i. e. verse-quarters which are included in the critically
constituted text as well as those which form part of the passages regarded as interpola-
tions and which appear either as starred passages in the footnotes or in the appendices.
This {%Pratīka-Index%} appeared in six volumes and took as many years for its com-
pletion (1967-1972)
<F>2) The {%Pratīka-Index%} to the {%Harivaṃśa%} which forms part of the 6th volume of the above
edition, however, does not take into account the interpolated passages but is restricted only
to the critical text.</F>; and (2) A handy edition of the {%Mahābhārata%} giving only the
critically constituted text and omitting the critical apparatus and the interpolated
passages. It appeared in four volumes (1971-1975)
<F>3) Similar edition of the {%Harivaṃśa%} appeared as volume 5 of this edition in 1976.</F>.
<P>Long before the completion of the work on the critical edition in all respects
in 1975, the idea of writing an Epilogue to the {%Mahābhārata%} had taken root. In the
Annual Report of the Institute for the year 1951-52 (p. 3) we find for the first time,
under the activities of the Post-graduate and Research Department of the Institute, a
mention of a research project relating to the Epilogue of the {%Mahābhārata%} which the
University of Poona had undertaken to finance with an annual grant of Rs. 3000 /-.
<F>4) This was continued up to 1973. In the year 1969-70, Prof. Dr. K. R. Karandikar gave a
generous donation of Rs. 10,000 /- for the Epilogue.</F>
<P>In 1951, Dr. S. K. Belvalkar, the then General Editor of the Critical Edition,
published a detailed outline of the scheme of the literary and historical Epilogue to the
{%Critical Edition of the Mahābhārata.%}
<F>5) Prospectus of the Critical and Illustrated Edition of the Mahābhārata, India's Greatest
National Epic, including Outline Scheme for the Epilogue, Poona, October 1951, pp. 9-18.</F> The Epilogue, as envisaged by him, was meant
to assess “the net gain to Mahābhārata scholarship, due to the present edition, on
various questions of form, matter and structure that have engaged for over a hundred
years generations of scholars in and outside India … 
<F>6. Op. cit. p. 9.</F>”
<P>The Epilogue, as outlined by Dr. Belvalkar, had to deal with the following
subjects: (1) Nature and characteristics of the various versions of the epic:
[Page00-09+ 42]
(2) Origin and evolution of the Mahābhārata, determining the extent and authorship of
each stage; (3) Study of the archaisms and neologisms in grammar, metre, syntax
and vocabulary; (4) Study of the contents of the repetitions in the epic and of those
which it shares with the Rāmāyaṇa, the other Purāṇas, and some of the older Smṛti
texts; (5) Stylistic study and study of passages marked for their delineation of
passions and portrayal of characters with a view to determining unity of authorship;
(6) Interpretation of the epic-whether or not the kernel of the story is a historical
event and determination of the calendar of events in the story; (7) Study of geogra-
phical and cosmographical data and investigation of astronomical statements; (8) Investi-
gation of the allusions to the flora and fauna and, related to it, the state of agriculture
and transport, industry and commerce; dress, diet and domestic hygiene; arts (music,
dancing, painting etc.); crafts (carpentry, manufacture of ornaments and the like,
etc.); medicine, alchemy and astronomy; warfare (manufacture and use of arms,
military tactics, etc.); architecture; sports (hunting, gambling, etc); (9) Study of social
organisation; (10) Study of the system of education, and (11) of Rājanīti or the
Science and Art of Governance-comparison with the Dharmaśāstras, the Arthaśāstra,
and the Nītiśāstras; (12) Study of the statements on different systems of philosophy
like Sāṃkhya, Yoga, Pāśupata, Pāñcarātra and the like; (13) Interpretation in their
togetherness and unity of the several statements in the epic on the personality and
teachings of Lord Śrīkṛṣṇa; (14) Answering the question whether the Mahābhārata is
a literary product with a purpose of its own and, if so, determining the social, cultural
and philosophical background it offered for its ethico-philosophical {%obiter dicta;%} (15) The
position of the Bhagavadgītā; (16) The date of the Mahābhārata, i. e. the date of
the Bhārata war, of the first composition describing that event, of the Jaya, of the
Bhārata and of the Mahābhārata; (17) The position of the Mahābhārata as the
“Fifth Veda” which was looked upon as an authority by the new Śāstrakāras; (18)
Listing of typical illustrations from the critical apparatus explaining the types of
mistakes made by copyists and the emendations made by the students and Pandits;
(19) Preparation of a complete Bibliography, glossary of important words used in
unusual connotation, a Register of Proper Names, and an adequate General Index.
<P>Accordingly, Shri S. K. Dikshit was the first scholar to be appointed to do some
spade work for the project on the Epilogue for a couple of years (1951-53). The
project was then shifted from the post-graduate and Research Department
to the Mahābhārata Department of the Institute
<F>1) Of which it forms part till today.</F> and Shri G. B. Palsule continued
for a few months the work initiated by Shri Dikshit. Later, Shri D. B. Diskalkar
and Shri M. T. Sahasrabuddhe were formally appointed as Research Fellows for the
Epilogue Project, and “The general lines of the procedure to be followed [for the
Epilogue] were laid down by the Mahābhārata Department”.
<F>2. Institute's Annual Report for the year 1953-54, p. 12.</F> These two scholars left
the Institute after working for two years and in 1955 their work in the Epilogue project
was taken up by Acharya Shri V. P. Limaye, Dr. Smt. Kunda Sathe, and Prof. S. N.
[Page00-10+ 43]
Banhatti. These scholars, however, did not continue for more than a year, and in 1956
Shri V. M. Bedekar was appointed in the Project. Shri Bedekar carried on the work
for the Epilogue under the guidance, first of the General Editor, and then of the
Director (or Superintendent) of the Mahābhārata Department, for over twenty-two
long years (up to 3-1-1978). Initially Shri Bedekar wrote a number of papers
on various subjects related to the {%Mahābhārata%} which he felt would be useful for
writting the Epilogue. He also wrote pp. ccv to ccxlvii of the Introduction to the
Critical Edition of the Śāntiparvan.
<F>1) See Postscript by P. L. Vaidya, Critical Edition Vol. 16, p. ccxlviii.</F>
<P>In 1969 the Institute decided to undertake the preparation of the Cultural Index
to the {%Mahābhārata%}
<F>2) Its first mention occurs in the Institute's Annual Report for the year 1970-71, p. 10.</F> as a work preparatory to the writing of the Epilogue. The
necessity of having some kind of an Index to the {%Mahābhārata%} was felt since long.
This was pointedly expressed by M. Winternitz while reviewing
<F>3) {%ZDMG%} 64. 241-243, 1910.</F> the first four parts of
S. Sörensen's {%An Index to the Names in the Mahābhārata (with short explanations).%}
Winternitz reports that his unforgettable teacher Bühler often used to make heavy demands
on his pupils with a view to encouraging them to achiever maximum possible performance.
Some of these demands could be quite astonishing (frappierend). For example, Bühler,
on a certain occasion, told Winternitz: “Please look up, that occurs in the Mahābhā-
rata”. But that was not easy to do. For, asks Winternitz, at a time when not
even P. C. Roy's translation
<F>4) This should really read “Kesari Mohan Ganguli's translation”. See the Preface to the
fourth edition, 1981, published by Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers Pvt. Ltd., New Delhi.</F> of the Mahābhārata (1st edn. 1883-1896) was available,
nor the Register to A. Holtzmann's {%Das Mahābhārata und seine Teile%} (4 volumes
1892-1895), nor H. Jacobi's {%Mahābhārata: Inhaltsangabe, Index und Concordanz%}
{%der calcuttaer und bombayer Ausgaben%} (1903), was available, where was a young
beginner of Sanskrit studies to “look up” and find out a particular reference in the
enormous confused mass (in dem ungeheuren Wust) of a hundred thousand stanzas of
the great epic that Mahābhārata is ?
<P>With the publication of the three works noted above many things could be
traced to the {%Mahābhārata,%} but not all. Ganguli's translation was not an Index. The
second volume of Holtzmann's {%Das Mahābhārata und seine Teile%} which is entitled
{%Die Teile des Gedichtes%} and which appeared in 1893, gives the contents of the {%Mahā-%}
{%bhārata%} and the {%Harivaṃśa%} and is provided with a Register at the end to cover all
the four volumes of the book. Similarly Jacobi's work on the {%Mahābhārata%} gives the
contents of the text (pp. 1-192), along with an Index of proper names (pp. 193-240),
and a concordance of the texts as they appear in the Calcutta and the Bombay editions
(pp. 242-257). Both these works,
<F>5) A similar book, {%The Mahābhārata—Analysis and Index%} by Edward P. Rice, appeared in
1934. It claims to be a {%map%} to the ‘Jungle’ of information that the {%Mahābhārata%} offers.</F> useful no doubt in their times,
<F>6) Jacobi notes that his work was to be useful not only to a layman but also to a specialist
as a town-map is indispensable even to a long resident of a big town. (Preface p. III).</F> served only a
[Page00-11+ 40]
limited purpose since both of them were based on the statements about the contents of
the epic made by the respective authors in their works. What was required, as
Winternitz noted in his review, was an Index based on {%the text of the Mahā-%}
{%bhārata itself.%}
<P>This need was admirably fulfilled by S. Sörensen's {%Index to the names in the%}
{%Mahābhārata%} which appeared in 1925 (reprint 1963). The utility of Sörensen's Index
is manifold and is not to be doubted.
<F>1) For the merits Sörensen's Index, see Winternitz, op. cit. p. 242.</F> It registers names of persons and mythological
beings and their epithets, as well as names of peoples, place names, names of weapons,
and the titles of {%parvans%} and {%ākhyānas%} along with the summaries of their contents.
<P>Sörensen's Index was based on the Calcutta edition of the epic which, in the
absence of a critical edition, was probably the best thing to do. However, in 1910,
while writing his review, Winternitz raised the question whether it was worthwhile to
undertake the preparation of an Index based on any particular version of the epic when
its critical edition, as then envisaged by the European scholars, was under preparation.
He, himself, however, answered the question in the affirmative, realizing full well the
enormous difficulties that lay in the way of completing the task. Winternitz proved to be
right. As it happened, the European undertaking had to come to a standstill during the first
world war, and it was never taken up again thereafter. The Indian enterprise began in
1919 and took nearly half a century for its completion. The present {%Cultural Index,%}
work on which may be said to have started around 1969, has just begun to appear.
Sörensen's Index, the first parts of which appeared during 1904-1908, has thus
served the needs of scholars for nearly a century.
<P>With the publication of the {%Critical Edition of the Mahābhārata%} (Poona, 1933
-1966), the need was again felt for an Index which would be based on the critically
constituted text and which would not be restricted only to the proper names of all sorts
but would cast its net wide so as to cover all aspects of Indian Culture. Shri Bedekar,
then the lone hand in the Epilogue department of the Institute, started extracting
relevant material from several {%parvans%} during the year 1969-70. Shri Bedekar thus may
be said to have really started the work of collecting material for the Cultural Index to
the Mahābhārata.
<P>In 1971, Shri Bedekar began to be assisted in his work of extracting material by
Smt. Vijaya Deshmukh. The material collected by these two scholars pertained to
personal names, names of gods and mythological beings, geographical names, and many
other aspects of Indian Culture. It was collected both from the critically constituted
text as well as the starred passages available in the foot-notes of the critical edition.
<P>After the sad demise of Shri Bedekar in January 1978, Dr. V. G. Rahurkar
joined the Institute as Research Professor
<F>2) Dr. G. K. Bhat also worked as a Research Professor for the Epilogue for a short period
of three months (June-August 1979).</F> for Epilogue and carried on the work of
[Page00-12+ 40]
collecting material for the Index. Dr. Rahurkar and Dr. (Smt.) Vijaya Deshmukh
continued this work till 1983.
<P>In 1983 the first stage for the preparation of the Index was reached when the work
of collecting the material from all the eighteen {%parvans%} was completed. Before this, a
scheme of classification of the Index Cards (totalling about a lakh and fifty thousand)
according to different subjects noted by Dr. Belvalkar in his Outline given above,
was also drawn up by the Mahābhārata Department. It was then broadly envisaged by
the Department that the Index material would fall into six major heads like: 1. Names;
2. Events; 3. Concepts—(a) philosophical, (b) religious, (c) political, (d)
social, (e) fine arts and crafts, (f) science and technology; 4. Realia—(a) per-
sonal (dress, cosmetics, and the like), (b) day-to-day life (food, drink, games, etc.),
(c) habitation (buildings, forts, and the like), (d) war (subjects like arms, weapons,
{%vyūhas,%} etc.), (e) agriculture, (f) other professions (trades in articles, specialized
trades), (g) animals (customs and beliefs associated with them), (h) social life
(customs and manners, superstitions, and the like), (i) valuable articles (minerals,
stones, precious wood, and the like); 5. Geography; 6. Divisions of time.
<P>In August 1983, Dr. M. A. Mehendale joined the Bhandarkar Institute as the
Editor of the Epilogue.
<F>1) The need for the appointment of a full-time Editor for the Epilogue was already expressed
as early as 1968 (Institute's Annual Report for 1968-69, p. 11).</F> With the assistance of Dr. Rahurkar and Dr. Deshmukh, he
started the work on the second stage, i. e. the classification of the cards under the main
six heads indicated above. It was soon discovered that as far as the interpolated pas-
sages were concerned, the material was collected only from the short starred passages in
the foot-notes to the critical edition, but the long interpolated passages appearing in the
appendices to several {%parvans%} had remained untouched. It was therefore decided to restrict
the present Cultural Index to the critically constituted text. Dr. Rahurkar left in 1986
while he was still dealing with the cards of the Udyogaparvan. Dr. P. D. Navathe,
the Curator of the Manuscripts Department of the Institute, was then requested to
complete and check the work on the Udyogaparvan. He readily agreed and completed
the work in his spare time over the years. During the next period of five years (1987-
1992) a number of scholars were appointed for the work of classifying the cards which
they did for a shorter or a longer period varying from six months to three years. These
scholars included
<F>2) Shri Achyutananda Dash worked only for two months in 1987.</F> Shri P. C. Sahoo, Dr. D. V. Garge, Shri S. K. Pani, Smt. Jayanti
Tripathi, Smt. Sucheta Paranjape, Smt. Svaruchi Joshi and Shri N. B. Marathe. Of
these, only Shri Marathe still continues to work for the Cultural Index.
<P>The work on the second stage of classifying the cards under the major heads
was completed in 1992. In the meantime, Dr. Mehendale published “A Tentative
Specimen Fascicule of the Cultural Index to the Mahābhārata” in the {%Annals%} of the
Institute, Vol. LXVI (1985), pp. 117-152. This was done with a view to giving some
[Page00-13+ 38]
concrete shape to the work on the Index that was going on over the years. The fasci-
cule was styled “Tentative” because it was attempted at a time when not all the
cards on the various entries included in the Specimen Fascicule were available to
the author.
<P>The stage was now set for a further internal classification of the cards, which
then fell into six main divisions, and their alphabetization. This was taken up in the
early months of 1992 by Shri Marathe, Dr. Deshmukh and Dr. Mehendale, when Dr.
R. N. Dandekar suggested to Mehendale that a beginning might be made to write out
the final entries of the Index and publish them as a first fascicule. A suitable occasion
had presented itself by Providence, since on July 6, 1992, the Bhandarkar Oriental
Research Institute completed its 75th year of existence, and it was decided by the
authorities of the Institute to celebrate 1992-93 as the {%Amṛtamahotsava%} year.
<P>Ideally the publication of the first section of the Cultural Index should have
begun with the names of persons, gods and other mythological beings. But the condi-
tion of the corpus at that stage was not suitable for this. Hence it was decided to
start with smaller sections, material for which could be readily gathered and suitably
organized. The choice therefore fell on the names of serpents, birds, etc., to be followed
by those of missiles, weapons, etc. In a way this beginning with the names of {%snakes%}
and {%missiles%} also can have some justification. The {%Mahābhārata,%} as it is available
today, is supposed to have been narrated by Sūta Ugraśravas, which he, in his turn, had
heard at the {%snake%} sacrifice of king Janamejaya. And the basic theme of his narrative
centered round the war between the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas which was fought with
various {%missiles.%}
<P>The work of writing out the Index-entries for the two sections noted above and
seeing them through the press was started by Mehendale leaving the work of further
internal classification of the cards and their alphabetization to Shri Marathe and Dr.
Deshmukh. In addition to this work, Shri Marathe and Dr. Deshmukh also helped
Mehendale in going through the proofs, Shri Marathe specially paying attention to
verifying the textual references in the proofs. The result of this work is now being pre-
sented to the world of scholars in the form of the first fascicule of the {%Cultural Index.%}
<P>The Index entries hardly require any orientation. However, the following few
features may be noted:
<P>1. References, when necessary are given not only for the actual occurrence of
a given name, but also to the additional information that may have been supplied for it.
For example, of the two references 1. 31. 15, 2 given under the name Akarkara, the first
reference (15) indicates the stanza where the name occurs, the second (2) indicates
the stanza where it is said that the name Akarkara was listed by Sūta at the request
of Śaunaka.
[Page00-14+ 41]
<P>2. The information under each name and the references related to it are given
not according to the sequence of the {%parvans%} as, for example, was done by Sörensen,
but all the available information is first suitably arranged and then given in a certain
order. In the case of longer entries, the arranged information is first classified under
certain heads, e. g. the information under Gāṇḍīva (pp. 97-103) is classified under
such heads as: A Etymology; B. Origin; C. History; D. Association with Arjuna;
E. Description; F. Big Sound (produced by it); G. Use by Arjuna; H. Arjuna's
vow regarding the bow; I. Comparisons; J. Defeat; K. Return to Varuṇa. Where
found necessary, the information, first classified under the major heads as above, is
further divided into sections and sub-sections, e. g. the information about the use of
Brahmāstra given under F. (pp. 123-124) is classified according as: 1. its
use in the epic war, and 2. its use outside the epic war; and then again, its use by
various heroes such as (i) Droṇa, (ii) Arjuna, (iii) Karṇa etc., and then further
(a) (by Droṇa) against Arjuna, (b) against Yudhiṣṭhira etc.
<P>3. Information given for a particular name is limited to the actual occurrences
of the name in the text. Hence every single incident related to the name is not narrated
up to its end but is left when the name does not figure in the further development of the
incident, e. g. under the entry Vajra
<F>1) It is only in rare cases like the one of the elephant Supratīka of Bhagadatta that references
are given although the elephant's name is not specifically stated (p. 71. 2).</F> (pp. 131-137), the incident related to the meeting
of Bali and Indra, or the one in which Garuḍa and Indra figure (p. 134) are narrated
only up to the point where Vajra figures in those incidents and are not told in full.
<P>4. Similarly in the case of an item like Gāṇḍīva, Arjuna is very likely to
have used this bow on all important occasions after he received it at the time of the
burning of the Khāṇḍava forest. The information and the references in the Index are,
however, limited to the actual occurrences of the name Gāṇḍīva in the text of the
Mahābhārata.
<F>1) It is only in rare cases like the one of the elephant Supratīka of Bhagadatta that references
are given although the elephant's name is not specifically stated (p. 71. 2).</F>
<P>5. Actual citations from the text are given if it was felt that it would help the
reader if he had before him the actual words of the text; or in the case of the {%subhā-%}
{%ṣitas%} (e. g. {%daivenopahato rājan … nānyat tatra parāyaṇam%} on p. 7. 2, or {%na hi kaścit%}
{%kṛte kārye … sāvaśeṣāṇi kārayet%} on p. 38. 2); or in the case of etymologies ({%dhatte%}
{%dhārayate cedam etasmāt kāraṇād dhanam%} p. 18. 1), or in the case of unintelligible
or doubtful expressions ({%sāgarasya gṛhān iva%} p. 31. 2; {%sarpāṇām pragrahā yānti%}
p. 32. 2; {%ekas tatra balopeto dhuram udvahate 'dhikām%} p. 75. 1).
<P>6. Commentator Nīlakaṇṭha's (Nī.) view is cited if he has a different opinion
(e. g. Krathana according to him is the name of a Yakṣa p. 14. 2); or in support of
the meaning adopted of a peculiar word (e. g. {%kṛtrimaḥ svecchāsampādyaḥ%} p. 17. 2;
{%draviṇavattarau balavattarau%} p. 18. 1; {%tṛṇarājas tātaḥ%} p. 99. 1); or if he has a
fanciful etymology to suggest, e. g. of Pināka p. 116. 2. In all the cases where
[Page00-15+ 19]
Nīlakaṇṭha is cited references are also given to the Bombay edition in order to enable
the reader to locate Nīlakaṇṭha's text.
<F>1. Unfortunately these have been missed under the entries Aśvakranda (p. 4. 1) and Ulūka
(p. 6. 1) which in both cases should be: 1. 32. 18 Bom. Ed.</F>
<P>7. There are a few adjectival entries which cannot be strictly called names,
e. g. Āsura (pp. 92. 2-93. 1), Gāndharva (p. 103. 1-2). These have been included
for the sake of completeness. For a similar reason, and also because they have some
important information to give, there are entries of some appellative words although the
objects denoted by them are not named e. g. Kīṭa (p. 86, 1); the entries like Paraśu
(p. 111. 1), Pāśa (p. 113. 2), etc. appear here under the section on Names only so
far as they are associated with some definite persons or deities. Where this is not the
case their treatment will be found later under the section on weapons.
<P>In the end I have great pleasure in expressing my thankfulness to Dr. R. N.
Dandekar for his encouragement and continued interest in the progress of the Project,
to my colleagues in the Institute with whom I had the benefit of discussing various
points of interpretation, and to the past and present workers in the Epilogue Department.
I am also thankful to the Institute's Office and library staff, as also to the Press
Staff for bearing with my hand-written sheets of entries.

{@A.@} Early life: Daughter of Nāgarāja
Airāvata (daughter not named here, but appa-
rently identical with Ulūpī); married first to
a {%nāga%} who was killed by Suparṇa; she had
no child; next, given by her father as wife
to Arjuna 6. 86. 6-8; her son Irāvant called
a {%dāyāda%} of Arjuna 6. 86. 11; yet Irāvant
described as the son fathered by Arjuna on
the wife of another person ({%parakṣetra%}) 6.
86. 11 [apparently {%parakṣetra%} here intended
to mean that Ulūpī was a widow when married
to Arjuna; no mention in this narration of
Ulūpī's amorous advance ({%sāhasa%}) to Arjuna
1. 206. 17.] {@B.@} Meeting with Arjuna:
described in the {%Arjunavanavāsaparvan%} 1.
2. 91 = 1. 206; she saw Arjuna while bathing
in Gaṅgā; fell in love with him and dragged
him into water; on enquiry she told Arjuna
[Page006-b+ 41]
she was the daughter of the serpent ({%pannaga%})
Kauravya born in the family of Airāvata; she
requested Arjuna to make her happy by
uniting with her; she pleaded that he would
not thereby violate his vow to observe
celibacy for twelve years since, by uniting
with her, he would be offering protection to
the distressed and would be saving her life;
Arjuna agreed to her request 1. 206. 13-33
[No mention in this narration of Arjuna's
marrying her]. {@C.@} Role in Arjuna's battle
with Babhruvāhana: Ulūpī enraged when
Arjuna rebuked her ‘son’ Babhruvāhana for
not offering a fight; she who was versed in the
duties of a Kṣatriya ({%kṣātradharmaviśāradā%}
14. 78. 10), therefore broke open the earth and
appeared on the scene; she introduced herself
to Babhruvāhana as his mother and asked him
to fight with Arjuna 14. 78. 8-13; Citrāṅgadā,
mistaking Arjuna and Babhruvāhana to be
dead when they fell unconscious on the
ground in the armed conflict that followed,
scolded Ulūpī for inciting Babhruvāhana to
offer a fight; she requested Ulūpī to bring
Arjuna to life, not minding the death of
Babhruvāhana 14. 79. 2-7, 12-17; Babh-
ruvāhana, on gaining consciousness scolded
Ulūpī for the same reason 14. 80. 13-15; Ulūpī
told Babhruvāhana that Arjuna was not really
dead but was in a swoon as she had employed
{%mohinī māyā;%} she asked Babhruvāhana to fight
because Arjuna wanted to put his strength
to test; she then thought of the {%saṅjīvana%}
{%maṇi%} and asked Babhruvāhana to place it
on Arjuna's chest to bring him back to
consciousness 14. 81. 2, 4-7, 9-10; Arjuna,
when revived, asked Ulūpī the reason for her
presence on the battle-field 14. 82. 1-4; she told
Arjuna that what she did was for the atonement
({%niṣkṛti%}) and pacification ({%śānti%}) through his
son for his sinful act in felling down Bhīṣma in
[Page007-a+ 39]
an unlawful way ({%adharmeṇa%}) 14. 82. 8-11;
when Bhīṣma fell, Vasus cursed Arjuna, where-
upon Ulūpī requested her father to intercede on
behalf of Arjuna; Ulūpī's inciting Babhru-
vāhana was to release Arjuna from that curse;
Arjuna expressed satisfaction at what Ulūpī
had done 14. 82. 15-22; Arjuna invited
Babhruvāhana to attend the Aśvamedha
with his two mothers (Ulūpī and Citrāṅgadā)
and took leave of his wives 14. 82. 24, 32.
{@D.@} Later life and End: She was one of those
who waited on Gāndhārī 15. 1. 21; Sāmba, a
Brāhmaṇa assured Dhṛtarāṣṭra on behalf of
his subjects that neither Kuntī, nor Draupadī,
nor Ulūpī, nor Subhadrā would do anything
harmful to the people 15. 16. 20; she entered

played in the Nala story: Nala heard him
inviting for help and saw him lying in coils in
a forest fire; he introduced himself as Nāga
Karkoṭaka; he once seized ({%?pralabdha%}) a
Brahmanical sage and, due to his curse, was
since unable to move; agreed to become
Nala's friend and, if saved by Nala,
assured to teach him something which
would stand him in good stead ({%śreyaḥ%});
Karkoṭaka could change his size at will and
become of the size of a thumb; he asked
Nala to take him some distance and
while doing so count his steps; Nala picked
him up and took him to a place where there
was no fire; at the tenth step ({%daśame%}
{%pade%}) he bit Nala when, apparently, Nala
must have uttered the word {%daśa%} (which
was also a command to bite); as a result Nala
became deformed ({%vikṛta%}); Karkoṭaka as-
sumed his natural form and advised Nala to
go to king Ṛtuparṇa of Ayodhyā; Karkoṭaka
changed Nala's appearance so that no one
should recognize him; he gave Nala two pieces
of cloth and asked him to put them on,
after remembering Karkoṭaka, to regain his
[Page011-b+ 39]
original form 3. 63. 1-24; the piece of cloth
was free from dust ({%vastram arajaḥ%}), and
when Nala did, as advised, he regained his
original form 3. 75. 17; Kali who had entered
Nala's body was all along burning due to the
sharp ({%tīkṣṇa%}) poison of Karkoṭaka which was
in Nala's body; when Kali came out of Nala's
body he vomitted this poison 3. 70. 27, 32.

{@Garuḍa@}¦, {@Garutmant, Tārkṣya, Vaina-@}
{@teya, Suparṇa@} m.: A mythical bird.
{@A.@} Origin: (a) According to 1. 2. 73
the origin is narrated in the Āstīkaparvan;
mind-born ({%saṃkalpaja%}) son of Kaśyapa and
Vinatā (1. 27. 27, hence often called Vaina-
teya; also Vinatātmaja, Vinatāsuta, Vinatā-
sūnu) 1. 14. 6, 8; 1. 27. 2, 27, 34; 1. 59. 39;
1. 60. 67; 5. 103. 10; born from one of the two
eggs of Vinatā placed in a warm pot ({%sopas-%}
{%veda bhāṇḍa%}) for over a thousand years; as
advised by her elder son Aruṇa, Vinatā did not
break the egg prematurely 1. 14. 12 14, 19-20;
when the proper time came Garuḍa came out
of the egg without mother's help 1. 20. 4; as
soon as born he left the mother and flew up
in the sky, from there to seek his destined
food (serpents, hence {%pannagasūdana%}) 1. 14.
22-23; as son of Vinatā, he is counted among
the six Vainateyas 1. 59. 39; 1. 114. 62;
(1. 60. 38); (b) Garuḍa born due to the
penance of the Vālakhilyas 1. 27. 27; once
Indra disregarded the Vālakhilyas; so they
offered a sacrifice to produce another Indra
for gods who would be a hundred times more
powerful than the then existing Indra 1. 27.
[Page015-b+ 41]
8-14; at the intervention of Kaśyapa Prajā-
pati, Vālakhilyas agreed to the proposal that
the one to be born as a result of their
sacrifice would be the ‘Indra’ of the birds 1.
27. 16, 20, 29; hence Garuḍa was consecrated
as Indra of birds 1. 27. 35; Rudra gave a
boon that the Vālakhilyas will produce by
their penance Suparṇa, the bringer of Soma
13. 14. 62-63; (c) At birth, Garuḍa
was of big size ({%mahākāyaḥ%}), having
blazing lustre and looking like a mass of
kindled fire 1. 20. 5, 7; all people thought
him to be fire; gods and sages requested Agni
not to burn the people; they were informed
by Agni that the mass of fire was Garuḍa,
Agni's equal in lustre 1. 20. 4-8; gods and
sages praised Garuḍa, whereupon Garuḍa with-
drew his lustre 1. 20. 10-14. {@B.@} Progeny:
Suparṇas: six sons of Garuḍa (Vainateya)
Sumukha (6. 7. 12) and others, extended the
lineage of Suparṇa; these live in the world of
Suparṇas with serpents as their food 5. 99. 1;
these six are thus the founders of the {%vinatā-%}
{%kula%} 5. 99. 3. {@C.@} Eminence: Garuḍa com-
pared with Pinākin 1. 28. 20; Upamanyu said
that Śiva was Vainateya among the birds 13.
14. 158; as the best among the birds he was
counted among the Vibhūtis of Bhagavān 6.
32. 30; Arjuna was like Garuḍa among the
birds 6. 116. 32; Vainateya never thought
highly of other birds whenever he con-
fronted them 6. 4. 34. {@D.@} Bringer of {%amṛta%}
(Soma): Some time after his birth Garuḍa
approached his mother who, as the slave of
Kadrū was on the other side of the ocean;
at her instance Vainateya carried on his
back serpents near the sun; serpents fainted
due to sun's (hot) rays 1. 21. 5-6; when
revived at Indra's intervention, Suparṇa
carried them to a beautiful forest in an island,
and from there to another island 1. 23. 1,
[Page016-a+ 41]
6-7; Garuḍa asked Vinatā why he must do
whatever serpents asked him to do; knowing
the reason (Vinatā's slavery), Garuḍa asked
serpents how his mother could be freed from
slavery; serpents asked him to get {%amṛta%} for
them (1. 23. 1-12); before starting on his
expedition, Garuḍa asked Vinatā what he
might eat on his way; she asked him to eat the
Niṣādas living in Niṣādālaya but warned him
never to harm a Brāhmaṇa; Vinatā told
Garuḍa how to recognize a Brāhmaṇa; at the
time of his departure he was blessed by
Vinatā; at Niṣādālaya he opened his beak
and ate up those that entered it 1. 24. 1-14;
a Brāhmaṇa and his wife inadvertently got
into his beak and burnt his throat; Garuḍa
opened the beak and let the Brāhmaṇa and his
wife, a Niṣādī, slip out, he was blessed by the
Brāhmaṇa 1. 25. 1-5; further on his way he
met his father Kaśyapa whom he told that he
was on his way to get Soma (1. 25. 7; {%amṛta%}
1. 25. 9) and asked what else he might
eat; Kaśyapa asked him to eat Supratīka,
(an elephant) and Vibhāvasu (a tortoise),
both of enormous size, and blessed him 1. 25.
7-9, 25; Garuda picked up the elephant and
the tortoise (who, according to 5. 107. 16, lived
in the south and used to fight with each other)
with his nails and went to Alambatīrtha and
sat on a Rohiṇa tree to eat the two; the branch
gave way under the tremendous weight 1. 25.
27-33; on this branch were the Vālakhilyas; to
save them from destruction Garuḍa (Tārkṣya
1. 26. 18) held the branch in his beak and flew
around; not finding a place to rest Garuḍa went
to his father Kaśyapa on the Gandhamādana
mountain; Kaśyapa told the Vālakhilyas
that Garuḍa's endeavour was in the interest
of the living beings; they left the branch;
Garuḍa (Vinatātmaja 1. 26. 15) asked
Kaśyapa to direct him to a place, free from
[Page016-b+ 41]
Brāhmaṇas, where he might leave the branch;
as advised, Garuḍa went to an uninhabited
mountain covered with snow and there ate the
elephant and the tortoise 1. 26. 1-16; as
Garuḍa drew near the place of {%amṛta,%}
there were bad omens for gods; when Indra
enquired the reason, Brahaspati told him that
Garuḍa was arriving to fetch Soma 1. 26.
36-37 (called also {%amṛta%} 1. 26. 38); Bṛhas-
pati told the gods that Garuḍa was of in-
comparable strength and would achieve what
was most difficult to achieve ({%asādhyam api%}
{%sādhayet%}) 1. 26. 37; Garuḍa (Garutmart
1. 28. 1; Vainateya 1. 28. 14; Vinatāsuta 1. 28.
20) fought with Bhauvana, the protector of
Soma (1. 28. 3), with other gods who were
protecting {%amṛta%} (1. 28. 6), an with birds
({%pakṣin%}) like Aśvakranda, Reṇuka and others;
he killed these, and put gods to flight; he fought
with wings, beak and nails 1. 28. 1-20; after
the fight Garuḍa saw {%amṛta%} surrounded
by fire; he divided his mouth into ninety
times ninety, fetched water in them from rivers,
poured it on the fire and pacified it; to enter
the fire he became small in size 1. 28.
22-25; near the {%amṛta%} he saw a wheel
of iron ({%ayasmaya%}), of sharp edge, which
was a device ({%yantra%}) created by gods to
cut down those who might try to steal
Soma; as he entered through the spokes
of the wheel he saw two serpents, with poi-
son in their eyes ({%cakṣurviṣau%}), guard-
ing {%amṛta;%} anyone seen by them would be
reduced to ashes; Suparṇa blinded their eyes
with dust and, unseen, he (Vainateya)
snatched Soma and flew away quickly; with
the force of his speed he uprooted ({%unmath-%})
the {%yantra%} 1. 29. 2-10; he himself did not
taste the {%amṛta%} but asked a boon from Viṣṇu
that he should become undecaying and im-
mortal without tasting {%amṛta%} 1. 29. 11, 14;
[Page017-a+ 41]
without going near him Indra struck Garuḍa,
as he was taking away {%amṛta,%} with his {%vajra;%}
to respect the sage (Dadhīca 1. 127. 12) from
whose bones the {%vajra%} was fashioned, the {%vajra%}
itself, and Indra, Garuḍa released a feather
from his wings, as though due to the stroke
of {%vajra,%} but otherwise was not affected
by the {%vajra%} 1. 29. 17-20; seeing the feather
of excellent form all beings ({%sarvabhūtāni%})
said “may this bird be Suparṇa” ({%surūpaṃ%}
{%patram ālakṣya suparṇo 'yaṃ bhavatv iti%})
1. 29. 21; Indra sought Garuḍa's friendship,
and Garuḍa agreed 1. 29. 23; 1. 30. 1
(Kaśyapa had prophesied before Garuḍa's
birth that he would be the helper of Indra 1.
27. 30); Indra requested Garuḍa to return
Soma, but Garuḍa told him the purpose of
taking it away; both hatched a plan—
Indra was to take away {%amṛta%} once Garuḍa
had placed it before the serpents and freed his
mother from slavery 1. 30. 7-9; Indra
granted Garuḍa a boon, and he chose ser-
pents to be his food 1. 30. 10-12 (hence his
epithets like {%pannagāśana%} 2. 22. 23; 5. 110.
5, 15; 5. 117. 23; {%pannagasūdana%} 1. 14.
22; {%bhujagendrāri%} 5. 110. 1; {%bhujagāri%} 10.
13. 4); Garuḍa brought {%amṛta%} to serpents and
placed it for them on the {%kuśa%} grass; he asked
them to take it after they had bathed and
become auspicious ({%maṅgalasaṃyuktāḥ%}); he
asked serpents to free his mother from slavery
from that day; the serpents agreed and went
to bathe; Garuḍa (Suparṇa) was happy to
roam with his mother Vinatā freely in the for-
est and to gladden her 1. 30. 14-21 (Aruṇa,
Garuḍa's elder brother, had prophesied that
Garuḍa would free Vinatā from slavery 1.
14. 18); {%phalaśruti:%} One who hears or recites
this narrative ({%kathā%}) will go to heaven due
to his glorifying Garuḍa, the lord of the birds
({%patagapati%}) 1. 30. 22. {@E.@} Gālava epi-
[Page017-b+ 41]
sode: Gālava was asked by his teacher Viśvā-
mitra to give him as {%dakṣiṇā%} eight hundred
moon-like white horses, each having a black ear
on one side (5. 104. 26); not knowing how to
procure these, Gālava desired to take recourse
to Viṣṇu; just then Garuḍa (Vinatātmaja),
the friend of Gālava, appeared before him and
offered to take him to any place 5. 105.
14-19; Suparṇa described to Gālava the four
directions 5. Adh. 106-109; he told Gālava
the etymology of the name of the direction
{%uttarā%} ({%yasmād uttāryate pāpāt%} ‘because one
is freed there from sin’ 5. 109. 1; also {%guṇair%}
{%anyair dig uttarā%} ‘a direction superior (to
others) in different qualities’, and {%sarva-%}
{%karmasu cottarā%} ‘better (than other direc-
tions) for performing all rites’ 5. 109. 24);
Gālava requested Garuḍa (named variously
as Garutmant, Suparṇa, Vinatātmaja,
Tārkṣya, Aruṇānuja) to take him to the east;
Garuḍa (Vinatāsūnu) agreed and asked
Galava to mount him 5. 110. 1-4; unable to
stand the speed of Garuḍa, Gālava requested
him (Vinatātmaja) not to proceed further
but to return to their place 5. 110. 14-15;
Gālava told Garuḍa that his real purpose was
to obtain the eight hundred horses and since
he knew no way to obtain them he thought of
giving up his life that way 5. 110. 16-17;
Garuḍa (Vinatātmaja) found fault with
Gālava for wanting to end his life and told
him: “The time of death is not determined
by any person, Kāla is rather supreme ({%na%}
{%cāpi kṛtrimaḥ kālaḥ kālo hi parameśvaraḥ%}
[Nīla.: {%kṛtrimaḥ svecchāsampādyaḥ%} 5. 112.
20 Bom. Ed.]) 5. 110. 19-20; he told Gālava
that they would first repair to mountain Ṛṣabha
in the heart of the ocean, eat, rest, and then
return 5. 110. 22; on the peak of the Ṛṣabha
mountain Suparṇa and Gālava met a Brāh-
maṇī Śāṇḍilī; they ate the food cooked by her

and slept; when Suparṇa woke up he found
himself to be just a ball of meat, bereft of
wings, with only mouth and feet left; he was re-
duced to that state because he belittled Śāṇḍilī
and had planned to take her away from that
place; he begged for forgiveness; Śāṇḍilī
relented and told Garuḍa that he would
be ‘Suparṇa’ again; Garuḍa got back his
wings which were stronger than before (Nīla.
{%draviṇavattarau = balavattarau%} 5. 113. 17
Bom. Ed.) 5. 111. 17; Śāṇḍilī advised Garuḍa
not to despise women at any time even if they
deserved to be despised ({%na ca te garhaṇīyāpi%}
{%garhaṇīyāḥ striyaḥ kvacit%} 5. 111. 16) 5. 111.
1-17; when Viśvāmitra, on his way, saw
Gālava without the horses he had asked for,
he blamed him in the presence of Vainateya
and said he would further wait for a period
of the same duration as before; Suparṇa,
having heard what Viśvāmitra had said,
explained to Gālava the importance of gold
and wealth (he told him the etymology of the
word {%dhana: dhatte dhārayate cedam etasmāt%}
{%kāraṇād dhanam%} 5. 112. 2) and took him to
his friend, king Yayāti, for getting wealth to
purchase the required horses; when they met
Yayāti, Garuḍa ({%vinatāsuta%}) requested him
on Gālava's behalf to part with some wealth;
Garuḍa assured Yayāti that Gālava in return
would give him a part of his {%tapas;%} Garuḍa
told Yayāti that since he was qualified to
give a gift and Gālava to receive it his
giving gift to Gālava would be like pouring
milk in a conch shell ({%śaṅkhe kṣīram ivā-%}
{%saktam%} 5. 112. 20) 5. 111. 18-23; 5. 112.
1-20; Yayāti listened to what Suparṇa had
said; he was delighted to meet Tārkṣya, his
friend; but Yayāti told him that he was no
longer wealthy; however as it was not meet to
frustrate the hopes of a {%viprarṣi,%} he was pre-
pared to part with his daughter Mādhavī by
[Page018-b+ 41]
marrying whom to some king Gālava could
acquire wealth as bride price ({%śulka%}) to buy
the horses; Garuḍa having shown the way to
Gālava to acquire the horses left him and
went to his residence 5. 113. 1-16; when
Gālava had procured six hundred out of the
eight hundred required {%śyāmakarṇa%} horses, he
met Garuḍa (Vinatātmaja) again 5. 116. 21;
Garuḍa (Vainateya) heard Gālava's story;
he (Suparṇa) told Gālava that he would never
find more than six hundred horses as, before
him, Ṛcīka did not get more than six hundred
horses; Garuḍa advised Gālava to give
Mādhavī to Viśvāmitra in lieu of the remain-
ing two hundred horses; Suparṇa then took
Gālava, Mādhavī and the six hundred horses
to Viśvāmitra; Gālava was thus able to pay
the {%dakṣiṇā%} his teacher had demanded with the
help of Suparṇa; Gālava permitted Suparṇa to
leave 5. 117. 1-23. {@F.@} Sumukha (a serpent)
episode: Serpent Āryaka told Mātali who
wanted his daughter to be married to Sumukha
that Cikura, his son, was killed by Vainateya
and that the same fate awaited his grand-son
Sumukha in a month's time; Mātali assured
Āryaka that he would endeavour to mitigate
the threat of Suparṇa to Sumukha; when
they all approached Indra, Viṣṇu asked
Indra to give {%amṛta%} to Sumukha and make
him immortal; Indra, remembering the pro-
wess of Vainateya, was reluctant to part
with {%amṛta%} and asked Viṣṇu himself to give
it to Sumukha; when asked by Viṣṇu again,
Indra gave only long life to Cikura
but not {%amṛta%} 5. 102. 14-27; 5. 101. 24.
{@G.@} Association with Viṣṇu: (1) As
standing on his flag-staff and as his vehicle:
While fetching {%amṛta%} from heaven, Vaina-
teya met Viṣṇu on way; when offered a boon
by Viṣṇu, Garuḍa chose that he should stay
above Viṣṇu ({%tava tiṣṭheyam upari%}); when
[Page019-a+ 41]
Garuḍa in return offered a boon to Viṣṇu,
he chose Garuḍa to serve him as his vehicle
({%vāhana%}), and since Garuḍa wanted to stand
above him Viṣṇu asked Garuḍa to stand on his
flag-staff ({%dhvajaṃ ca cakre%}) 1. 29. 12-16;
hence after the death of Jarāsandha when
Kṛṣṇa thought of Garuḍa (Garutmant), he
instantly appeared and took his seat on (the
flag-staff of) the chariot; the flag-staff then
appeared as a raised {%caitya%} post 2. 22. 22-
23; Kṛṣṇa's flag marked with Garuḍa when
he started for Hāstinapura 5. 81. 20; when
Dāruka brought Kṛṣṇa's chariot for the use of
Sātyaki it was marked with Suparṇa 7. 122.
43; also 7. 56. 33 (Vainateya); when Kṛṣṇa
got his chariot ready to pursue Aśvatthāman,
Vainateya stood on the flag-staff 10. 13. 4;
when, at the end, the Vṛṣṇis were helplessly
looking on, Suparṇa on the flag of Kṛṣṇa was
taken away day and night by the Apsaras 16.
4. 5; Kṛṣṇa (Viṣṇu) is called {%Garuḍadhvaja%}

55; {%Tārkṣyadhvaja%} 8. 27. 65; (also cf. 12.
46. 34); {%Tārkṣyalakṣaṇa%} 12. 43. 8; Kṛṣṇa
used Vainateya as his vehicle while fetching
Pārijāta from Amarāvatī 7. 10. 22; he used
Tārkṣya as vehicle while going to Himavant
to propitiate Śiva 13. 14. 26 and Vainateya
while waiting on him 13. 14. 142; Garuḍa
felt he was disregarded by Indra because he
stood on the flag of Indra's younger brother
and because he carried him (Kṛṣṇa) on his
back and was thus reduced to the state of a
servant 5. 103. 13, 8; Viṣṇu asked Garutmant
to bring king Vasu Uparicara from Pātāla
and make him a {%khecara%} 12. 324. 30-35;
(2) Removal of Garuḍa's pride: When
Garuḍa knew that Indra had granted long life
to the serpent Sumukha he blamed Indra for
[Page019-b+ 41]
depriving him of his food; he threatened to
give up his life and said that as long as Indra
was there he had nothing to do with Viṣṇu
({%na viṣṇuḥ kāraṇaṃ mama%}) 5. 103. 1-17;
Viṣṇu scolded Garuḍa (Tārkṣya, Garutmant)
for praising himself although in reality he was
very weak; Viṣṇu told Garuḍa that he did not
really carry Viṣṇu but Viṣṇu carried himself
and also Garuḍa ({%aham evātmanātmānaṃ%}
{%vahāmi tvāṃ ca dhāraye%} 5. 103. 20); how-
ever he asked Garuḍa to carry only his right
arm, and when the arm was placed on Garuḍa
he fell down under its weight and became
almost unconscious ({%vicetāḥ%}); he shed many
feathers; Viṣṇu did not deprive him of his
life; finally Garuḍa bowed down to Viṣṇu
and begged for forgiveness 5. 103. 18-30.
{@H.@} Association with Śeṣa: Śeṣa complained
to Pitāmaha that his dull-witted brothers
(serpents) hated their brother (cousin) Vai-
nateya and he in turn hated them 1. 32.
10-11; Pitāmaha then made Garuḍa
(Suparṇa, Vainateya) a friend of Śeṣa 1. 32.
25. {@I.@} Association with Skanda: Suparṇa
gave Skanda a feather and a peacock as toy
({%krīḍanīya%}) 13. 86. 20-21; he gave peacock
to Skanda 9. 45. 46; he attended Skanda's
consecration as general of the army 9. 44.
14; some of the warriors of Skanda were
Garuḍa-faced ({%garuḍānanāḥ%}) 9. 44. 79.
{@J.@} Garuḍa's other feats: (1) Suparṇa
swallowed a quail which, however, was
freed by Aśvinau 1. 3. 62; (2) Garut-
mant often went to the mountain Himavant
12. 314. 6; Suparṇa once carried away
forcibly the big snake Ṛddhimant living
near a lake on the Gandhamādana mountain;
the wonderful feat ({%adbhutam%}) was witnessed
by the Pāṇḍavas 3. 157. 14-15; (3) A ser-
pent (not named), husband of the daughter
of Airāvata, killed by Suparṇa 6. 86. 7;
[Page020-a+ 41]
(4) Suparṇa (and Suparṇas) fought with
Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna who protected the fire at
Khāṇḍava; he fought with wings, beak, and
nails 1. 218. 19-20; 8. 63. 68 ({%nakha, daśana%}
(? for beak); (5) During his fight with
demons (Daiteyas) he performed the great
feat of killing six of them 5. 103. 11-12.
{@K.@} Strength: Indra described Garuḍa
as a great being ({%mahad bhūtam%}) and
wished to know the extent of his strength
(1. 29. 22, 23); Garuḍa said that although
good persons did not themselves describe
their strength and virtues he would do so due
to his friendship with Indra; Garuḍa could
carry the whole earth with mountains etc.,
the worlds, even with Śakra, with only a
quill of his feather ({%pakṣanāḍī%}), and this
without feeling fatigue 1. 30. 2-5; also cf.

(1) Based on his enmity with serpents:
Bhīṣma wanted to kill Śālva as Garuḍa killed
a serpent 1. 96. 36; also 7. 35. 27; 7. 149. 26;
8. 63. 68; 8. 66. 22; (Garutmant) 3. 157.

sins by seeing Gaṅgā as serpents lose poison
at the sight of Tārkṣya 13. 27. 43; [also see
the next]; (2) Based on his speed, vehe-
mence and agility: (i) arrows: speed of
arrows compared to that of Suparṇa 7. 109.
32; 6. 79. 50 (Garutmant); (ii) horses:
Arjuna's horses compared with Garuḍa 8. 45.
68; 7. 103. 8 (Suparṇa); speed of horses
dispatched by Duryodhana like that of Garut-

compared with Suparṇa 1. 63. 11; (iii) in-
dividual heroes: Aśvatthāman's speed, while
rushing to attack Dhṛṣṭadyumna, compared
to that of Garuḍa rushing to catch a serpent
8. 42. 39; Abhimanyu so compared 7. 51. 7
(Suparṇa); 7. 47. 35 ({%pakṣirāj%}); Bhīma so

arrows: 7. 172. 22; 8. 62. 51 (?) (Suparṇa);
(iii) strong wind 3. 157. 19 (Suparṇa);
(4) The noise produced by flight: (i) cha-
riot's sound compared with it 3. 230. 18; 6. 86.
[Page021-a+ 39]
18 (Suparṇa); sound of Arjuna's chariot like
that of Garuḍa rushing for serpents 8. 55.
22; (5) Capacity to carry burden: Bhīma,
taking his mother and brothers on his
back, would fly like Vainateya 3. 13. 82;
(6) Lustre: Śuka flying up from Kailāsa
towards heaven had the lustre ({%dyuti%}) of
Vainateya 12. 319. 11; Sutasoma appeared
to have the lustre equal to the prowess
of Tārkṣya 8. 18. 32; (7) Formidable
appearance: Bhīma with his mace, ready to
fight with Duryodhana, looked like Garut-
mant 9. 54. 14; Bhīma and Duryodhana
fought as two Garutmants would for the flesh

{@Jaratkāru@}¦ f.: A female serpent ({%bhu-%}

1. 49. 1; ({%bhujagottamā%}) 1. 48. 25.
{@A.@} Family: Younger sister ({%anujā%}
{%svasā%}) of Vāsuki 1. 13. 34. {@B.@} Marriage:
She was to be given in marriage to sage Jarat-
kāru as alms ({%bhaikṣavat%}) when he came
begging (for a girl of his name); this was
originally the suggestion made by Brahmā to
gods for saving serpents and it was reported
to Vāsuki by Elāpatra 1. 34. 9-18; 1. 49. 13;
this was told again by Brahmā to Vāsuki
1. 35. 8-11; so Vāsuki kept Jaratkāru
without marrying her to any one 1. 13. 34;
1. 35. 2; when sage Jaratkāru announced his
decision to marry a girl of his name, Vāsuki
was informed of it by his serpent attendants;
Vāsuki adorned his sister, told the sage that
she had the same name as his, and assured
him to maintain her even after marriage;
sage Jaratkāru agreed to marry her; she was
[Page023-b+ 40]
given as alms ({%bhaikṣavat%}) and with due
rites 1. 42. 14-20; 1. 43. 1-4; 1. 13. 30-34,
36-37. {@C.@} Dutiful wife: The sage lived
with his wife at the residence of Vāsuki; she
agreed to her husband's condition ({%samaya%})
not to do anything that would displease
him and that if she did he would leave her;
1. 43. 7-9; once when she had bathed after
her period she lay with her husband and
conceived a child 1. 43. 11-12; after a few
days when the sage had slept with his head
on Jaratkāru's lap the sun was about to set;
Jaratkāru awakened her husband for the
evening rites; the angered sage got ready to
leave her as his wife had displeased him; she
told him that she woke him up not out of dis-
regard but to save him from violating {%dharma.%}
{@D.@} Concern for kinsmen: She pleaded with
the sage not to leave her until she bore him a
son as she was anxious for the welfare of her
kinsmen; the child she had already conceived
might not be a son ({%avyaktarūpaṃ garbham%}
1. 43. 36); the sage thereupon assured his
wife that she would give birth to a fire-like,
learned son 1. 43. 13-39; Jaratkāru informed
her brother Vāsuki about the sudden departure
of her husband; Vāsuki was scared but Jarat-
kāru told him about the assurance her husband
gave her and that he had never told a lie be-
fore 1. 44. 1-13. {@E.@} Birth of Āstīka: Vāsuki
honoured his pregnant sister in all ways,
and at proper time Jaratkāru gave birth to a
child of divine lustre ({%devagarbhābha%}) 1. 44.
15-17; he was named Āstīka 1. 44. 20; 1. 13.
37. {@F.@} Snake sacrifice: Vāsuki, terrified
at the destruction of snakes in the snake
sacrifice of Janamejaya, went to Jaratkāru
and reminded her of the purpose for which
she was married to sage Jaratkāru; he asked
her to tell her son Āstīka to intervene and
[Page024-a+ 40]
stop the snake sacrifice 1. 48. 20-26; Jarat-
kāru informed Āstīka why she was married
to his father and asked him to stop the
sacrifice 1. 49. 1-16; Āstīka assured Jarat-
kāru that he would fulfil the purpose of his
birth 1. 49. 17; on completing his mission
Āstīka informed his mother (and Vāsuki)
what had happened at the snake sacrifice 1.
53. 17. {@G.@} Reward: Since Jaratkāru
saved the life of snakes her name appeared
in the {%mantra%} to be recited for obtaining
protection from serpents 1. 53. 22.

sage Mandapāla turned himself into a {%Śārṅga%}

her four sons 1. 220. 16-17; when Mandapāla
left his sons, still in the form of eggs, and went
to Lapitā, another {%Śārṅga%} female, Jaritā was
very much worried out of her affection for the
young ones 1. 220. 17-18; she did not aban-
don the eggs and when they were hatched, she
reared them as a bird would do ({%svavṛtyā%})
1. 220. 19; when the Khāṇḍava forest was
on fire she was distressed and lamented for her
sons who had then not developed feathers, or
feet; she did not have strength enough to fly
to a safe place taking all the young ones with
her; she did not know whom to abandon and
whom not; she therefore told her children that
she would cover them under her wings and
die with them 1. 221. 1-7; but the young ones
suggested to her to abandon them and save her-
self from fire 1. 221. 12; she then advised them
to enter the hole of a mouse under a tree which
she would cover with earth; when the fire sub-
sided she would return and remove the earth
1. 221. 15-17; the young ones hesitated for the
fear of the mouse; Jaritā tried to remove the
[Page024-b+ 40]
fear by telling them that the mouse had been
already picked up by a hawk ({%śyena%}); the
young ones were still sceptical; she once again
told them that when the hawk took the mouse
she flew behind the hawk and blessed him to
be golden when he went to heaven for he had
taken off the enemy of the birds 1. 222. 5-8;
the young birds remained firm in their resolve
not to enter the hole and asked their mother to
fly away to a safe place; Jaritā then left her
sons to their fate and flew away 1. 222. 10-
16; when the fire had moved away from that
place Jaritā, coveting her sons, returned and
seeing them safe tears came to her eyes again
and again; she could not believe that they
were safe 1. 224. 17-19; Mandapāla also
remembered Jaritā and his sons and wondered
what might have happened to them in the fire
1. 224. 3-5; Lapitā, the other {%Śārṅgikā,%} en-
vious of Jaritā asked Mandapāla to go to her
for whom he was in anguish 1. 224. 11-13;
Mandapāla met Jaritā and his sons, but the
sons would not talk to him; Jaritā, too,
asked Mandapāla what business he had with
the young birds and told him to return to the
young and sweet smiling Lapitā 1. 224. 21-
25; Mandapāla blamed Jaritā for her distrust
1. 224. 26-31, but also acknowledged her being
conversant with {%dharma (dharmajñatā)%}
1. 225. 2; when all were reconciled Manda-
pāla took his wife ({%bhāryā%}) Jaritā and the
sons with him and left for another country

Lived in Bhogavatī Purī in the southern direc-

be able to attack him 1. 3. 119-120; Tak-
ṣaka assumed the form of a naked mendi-
cant ({%nagna śramaṇa%}) and followed Uttaṅka
on way; he took the {%kuṇḍalas,%} placed by
Uttaṅka on the ground, and ran away; when
caught by Uttaṅka, Takṣaka assumed his
original form and suddenly entered a big hole;
on reaching {%nāgaloka%} he entered his residence
({%svabhavana%}); Uttaṅka went behind him
1. 3. 136-138; when the {%nāgaloka%} was filled
with smoke issuing from the anus of a horse

frightened by the heat of fire, returned the

hindrance caused by Takṣaka 1. 3. 165-166;
angered by this incident Uttaṅka started for
Hāstinapura to take revenge on Takṣaka
1. 3. 177. {@G.@} Death of Parikṣit: Due to
the curse pronounced by Śṛṅgin king Parikṣit
was destined to die within a week due to
the burning lustre of the eminent serpent
[Page027-a+ 41]
Takṣaka 1. 37. 13-14, 19; 1. 46. 8-10;
Śṛṅgin's father informed Parikṣit about
his impending death at the hands of Takṣaka
1. 38. 19; 1. 46. 12-13; Kāśyapa, an eminent
sage ({%munipuṃgava%} 1. 38. 35), who knew the
cure for serpent bites started for Hāstinapura
to save Parikṣit from Takṣaka and acquire
wealth 1. 38. 31-33; Takṣaka, in disguise of
an aged Brāhmaṇa, met Kāśyapa on way and
asked him the reason for his hurrying on the
way; Kāśyapa told Takṣaka that he wanted
to cure Parikṣit when he would be burnt by
the fire of Taṣaka's lustre ({%tejasā 'dya%}
{%pradhakṣyati%}); then Takṣaka revealed his
identity and told Kāśyapa that he would not
be able to save Parikṣit from Takṣaka's bite;
Kāśyapa retorted that he was confident about
the strength of his science ({%vidyābala%}) 1. 38.
34-39; 1. 46. 15-17; Takṣaka challenged
Kāśyapa to bring back to life a {%nyagrodha%}
bitten and burnt by him; this was done by
Kāśyapa by his {%vidyābala%} 1. 39. 1-10;
astonished, Takṣaka promised to give Kāśyapa
all the wealth he desired from Parikṣit, and
even more, and begged him to return; he also
told Kaśyapa that the curse of the sage was
bound to come true, and if Kāśyapa was not
able to save Parikṣit he would lose his reputa-
tion; having received from Takṣaka the wealth
he wanted Kāśyapa turned back 1. 39. 11-19;
1. 46. 18-21; Takṣaka then started for Hās-
tinapura; on way he learnt about the arrange-
ments made to save Parikṣit with the help of
{%mantras%} and medicines which worked as cures
for poison ({%mantrāgadair viṣaharaiḥ%} 1. 39.
21); Takṣaka planned to deceive Parikṣit with
some trick ({%māyāyoga%}) and sent to the king
serpents in the disguise of hermits with fruits,
leaves, and water; when the seventh day since
the curse was uttered was about to end Pari-
kṣit felt himself secure; he found a small
[Page027-b+ 41]
worm in the fruit held by him and said (in
joke): “may this small worm turn into
Takṣaka and bite me” ({%kṛmiko māṃ daśatv%}
{%ayam takṣako nāma bhūtvā vai%} 1. 39.
31) and put it on his neck; immediately
Takṣaka coiled around the king with his body
({%bhoga%}) 1. 39. 22-33; the ministers of the
king cried and fled; they saw a wonderful
({%adbhuta%}) serpent rising up in the sky 1. 40.
1-3; the whole house was on fire due to the
heat of the serpent's poison; Parikṣit died due
to the fire ({%tejas%}) of Takṣaka's poison 1. 40.
4-5; ({%chadmenopetya takṣakaḥ … dagdhavān%}
{%viṣavahninā%} 1. 46. 22-23). {@H.@} Snake-
sacrifice: Uttaṅka, embittered by Tak-
ṣaka due to the obstacle put by him in
Uttaṅka's way, reported to Janamejaya how
Takṣaka was responsible for his father's
death, and instigated him to burn Takṣaka
in the fire of a {%sarpasatra%} 1. 3. 177-190;
when Janamejaya enquired with his mini-
sters they told him how his father was killed
by Takṣaka (1. 45. 19-28; 1. 46. 1-25);
Janamejaya again asked them how they could
know the conversation between the Panna-
gendra (i. e. Takṣaka) and Kāśyapa when,
apparently, it took place in a secluded place
in the forest; if satisfied with their expla-
nation he would think of the means to kill
the serpents ({%vidhāsyāmi pannagāntakarīṃ%}
{%matim%}) 1. 46. 26-27; the ministers reported
that a man happened to mount the tree
before it was burnt by Takṣaka; this man
had heard the dialogue between Takṣaka and
Kāśyapa; the man too was burnt with the tree;
when brought back to life along with the
tree the man returned to the town and
reported the incident to others 1. 46. 28-31;
Janamejaya, satisfied with this account,
decided to avenge the death of his father by
killing serpents for it was the evil-minded
[Page028-a+ 41]
Takṣaka who had offered wealth to Kāśyapa
and persuaded him not to go to Hāstina-
pura 1. 46. 35-41; Janamejaya wished to
know from his house-priest if there was any
rite by which he could get Takṣaka and his
relatives in the kindled fire; just as Takṣaka
had burnt Parikṣit by the fire of his poison
({%viṣāgni%}), so too Janamejaya wished to burn
the serpent; priests informed Janamejaya about
a rite known as {%sarpasatra,%} not performed by
any one before; thereupon Janamejaya con-
sidered Takṣaka as good as burnt in the sacri-
ficial fire 1. 47. 3-8; Takṣaka having come
to know of the {%sarpasatra%} went to Indra and
sought his shelter; Indra had already propitia-
ted Pitāmaha on Takṣaka's behalf and there-
fore assured Takṣaka that there was no danger
to his life from the fire of {%sarpasatra;%}
Takṣaka then lived happily in Indra's dwelling
1. 48. 14-18; in the meantime when the snake
sacrifice was in progress Āstīka appeared at
the place of sacrifice where serpents were
falling in the fire in large numbers; he praised
king Janamejaya; pleased, Janamejaya desired
to offer a boon to Āstīka and asked permis-
sion of the officiating priests; they gave the
permission since Takṣaka was to arrive soon;
but the {%hotṛ%} priest told Janamejaya that
Takṣaka was not showing; Janamejaya asked
the priests to spare no pains and get Takṣaka
quickly; the priests told the king that as the
Śāstras informed them and as the Fire narrat-
ed to them Takṣaka, out of fear, had taken
shelter with Indra 1. 51. 1-5 ({%yathā śāstrāṇi%}
{%naḥ prāhur yathā śaṃsati pāvakaḥ / indrasya%}
{%bhavane rājaṃs takṣako bhayapīḍitaḥ%}); the
king's bard Lohitākṣa, who knew what had
transpired ({%paurāṇiko veditavān purastāt%}
1. 51. 6), confirmed what the priests had told
the king; he said that Indra had asked
Takṣaka to stay with him and feel free from
[Page028-b+ 41]
any danger from fire; Janamejaya urged his
{%hotṛ%} priest to proceed and the priest with his
{%mantras%} called Indra himself; Indra appeared
on the scene with the serpent tucked to his
{%uttarīya;%} Janamejaya asked the priests to make
Takṣaka fall in the fire with Indra if he sought
shelter in Indra's residence; priests told Jana-
mejaya, as they heard a thunderous roar, that
Takṣaka was coming under the king's control,
they were sure that the serpent was dropped
down by Indra and was falling from his lap,
the serpent's body was loosened by the
{%mantras (mantravisrastakāyaḥ%} 1. 51. 13)
and he had lost consciousness; they permitted
Janamejaya to grant a boon to Āstīka since
the rite was progressing according to the pres-
cription and as Takṣaka was about to fall
into the fire; Āstīka chose the boon: “let
this sacrificial session come to an end, and
let no more serpents fall (into the fire)”
({%satraṃ te viramatv etan na pateyur ihora-%}
{%gāḥ%} 1. 51. 17); in vain did Janamejaya try
to persuade Āstīka to choose another boon;
Janamejaya agreed to stop the session and
granted freedom from risk to serpents 1.
51. 6-23; 1. 53. 8; Āstīka admitted that
Takṣaka was somehow saved because Jana-
mejaya followed the path of truth (and kept
his word) ({%kathaṃcit takṣako muktaḥ satya-%}
{%tvāt tava pārthiva%}) 15. 43. 14; Sūta called
it a great miracle of Āstīka that when Tak-
ṣaka slipped from Indra's hand, he remained
in the sky and did not drop down in the fire;
on Śaunaka's query whether Takṣaka's not
falling down from the mid-region was due to
the fact that the (suitable) {%mantras%}
did not reveal themselves to the priests
({%mantragrāmo manīṣiṇām na pratyabhāt%}
1. 53. 4), Sūta replied that that happened
because Āstīka thrice said to the serpent
‘stay’ ({%tiṣṭha%}) 1. 53. 1-6, and Takṣaka
[Page029-a+ 39]
stayed. {@I. Upamāna:@} Bhīṣma with his sharp

{@Nandinī (Nandī)@}¦ f.: A mythical cow.
{@A.@} Birth: Born of Surabhī, Dakṣa's
daughter, and Kaśyapa 1. 93. 8; also called
Nandī 1. 165. 15, 24, 25. {@B.@} Qualities
and Description: She was capable of fulfill-
ing all desires, hence called {%sarvakāmadughā%}
1. 93. 9, {%sarvakāmaduh%} 1. 93. 13; 1. 165.
9-11; the best cow ({%uttamā gauḥ%}) 1. 93.

1. 93. 15, 31; 1. 165. 13, 14, 21. {@C.@} Asso-
ciation with Vasiṣṭha: She was given to
Vasiṣṭha (son of Varuṇa) as his {%homadhenu%}
(who supplied milk for giving oblations); she
was seen moving in the forest by the wife
of Dyaus, one of the eight Vasus 1. 93. 13;
at her request Dyaus, together with other
Vasus, abducted Nandinī and her calf to be
given away to princess Jinavatī who was a
friend of the wife of Dyaus 1. 93. 26, 28,
21-23; [when cursed by Vasiṣṭha (1. 93. 31)
the Vasus possibly returned Nandinī and her
calf to Vasiṣṭha 1. 93, 34]. {@D.@} Conflict
between Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra: Viśvā-
[Page033-b+ 40]
mitra, while on a visit to Vasiṣṭha, was sur-
prised at the qualities of Nandinī; he asked
Vasiṣṭha to give her to him in exchange for an
{%arbuda%} cows or even his kingdom; Vasiṣṭha
declined to part with Nandinī as she was
needed for the worship of gods, guests and
manes; Viśvāmitra then declared his intention
to forcibly take her away; Viśvāmitra and
his army used force to take her away; they
beat her with whips, rods and stones and
bound her calf with a rope; lowing she appro-
ached Vasiṣṭha; when she knew that Vasiṣṭha
would not do anything to stop Viśvāmitra
out of forbearance and also that his non-
intervention did not mean he wanted to
forsake her she assumed a terrible form
({%prababhau ghoradarśanā%}) and produced
from parts of her body and excretions various
tribes like Pahlavas, Śakas, Śabaras and
others equipped with weapons; Viśvāmitra's
army was routed and his attempt to take
away Nandinī was foiled 1. 165. 2-40.

builder, he was respected by the artisans
({%śilpisaṃmataḥ%}) 3. 267. 41; whatever wood,
or straw, or stone he might throw in the ocean
that would not sink; at the suggestion of
the ocean, who appeared before Rāma, he
was asked to build a bridge across the ocean;
this bridge is even now known as Nalasetu

His wife, not named ({%nāgapatnī%} 12. 345. 4,
{%nāgī%} 12. 345. 13), virtuous and devoted;
she knew what the duties of a student and a
servant were, was familiar with the duties of
the four {%varṇas,%} and knew the duties of a
householder and his wife; she had learnt these
from her husband Padma; she therefore made
no mistake in receiving the guests during the
absence of her husband; on a certain occasion
she duly received and honoured a Brāhmaṇa
who arrived at Padma's residence 12. 345. 4-
12; when Padma arrived she informed him
about the arrival of a Brāhmaṇa who wanted
to meet him and had taken his residence on
the river Gomatī; she advised Padma to see
the Brāhmaṇa 12. 347. 13-16; Padma's sense
of pride was hurt since he was commanded
by a Brāhmaṇa to go and meet him; he there-
fore asked his wife whether the Brāhmaṇa was
really a human being or a god in disguise 12.
348. 1-2; his wife told him that she did not
consider the Brāhmaṇa to be a god (in dis-
guise); she advised her husband to give up his
[Page036-a+ 41]
inborn anger ({%tad roṣaṃ sahajaṃ tyaktvā%}
12. 348. 8) and go and meet the Brāhmaṇa
12. 348. 5-8; Padma realized that he was
too proud, that being the fault of his species
({%jātidoṣa%} 12. 348. 13), and was happy that
his wife had burnt his anger by her admoni-
tion ({%dagdho vācāgninā tvayā%} 12. 348. 13);
he felt himself praiseworthy to have such a
virtuous wife 12. 348. 13-14, 18-19; during
Padma's absence his relatives—brothers,
sons and wife—had gone to the river Gomatī
to persuade the Brāhmaṇa who almost
starved himself to take some food but he did
not; they returned home without achieving
their purpose 12. 346. 1-13. {@H.@} Padma's
functions: It was his duty to pull by
rotation the sun's one-wheeled chariot for
a month (in a year ?) ({%sūryarathaṃ voḍhuṃ%}
{%gato'sau māsacārikaḥ%} 12. 345. 8; {%vivasvato%}
{%gacchati paryayeṇa voḍhuṃ bhavāṃs taṃ%}
{%ratham ekacakram%} 12. 350. 1). {@I.@} Padma
and the Brāhmaṇa Dharmāraṇya (12. 349.
5): Padma returned home after he had
performed his duty of drawing the Sun's cha-
riot and was permitted by the god to leave;
he was then informed by his wife about
the arrival of a Brāhmaṇa; she informed
Padma that the Brāhmaṇa had asked him to
meet him; Padma's initial reaction, due
to his sense of pride, was not to oblige the
Brāhmaṇa; but on the advice of his wife he
relented and met the Brāhmaṇa; he then told
his wife that he realized that it was not in
one's interest to get angry for in bygone days,
Rāvaṇa, Kārtavīrya and his sons were killed
due to their anger 12. 348. 13-17; he appro-
ached the Brāhmaṇa Dharmāraṇya and asked
him what he wanted 12. 349. 3-4, 9-12; the
Brāhmaṇa first asked Padma a question; after
hearing Padma's answer, the Brāhmaṇa would
tell Padma the purpose of his visit 12. 349.
[Page036-b+ 41]
16; the Brāhmaṇa asked Padma to tell him if
while pulling the god Sun's chariot. he saw
anything wonderful on his way 12. 350. 1;
Padma first told the Brāhmaṇa that there was
nothing more wonderful than the Sun himself
(accomplished sages and deities resort to his
rays; wind resorts to sun's rays and flows
from there to fill the sky; rain water is released
by his dark foot (ray ?), Śukra by name,
({%śukro nāmāsitaḥ pādo yasya vāridharo%}
{%'mbare / toyaṃ sṛjati varṣāsu%} 12. 350. 4);
Sun takes back the rain water with his shining
ray during eight months; the soul ({%ātmā%}) is
for all times established in his lustre; he is the
seed of everything, movable and immovable
and the earth is sustained by him; the long-
armed, eternal, unalterable god having no
beginning and no end resides in the sun 12.
350. 2-7); Padma next told him that one day
something unusual happened: while the Sun
was shining brightly at mid-day, there
suddenly appeared light in all directions, light
similar to that of the sun; then, as if tearing
open the sky a being, looking like a second Sun
({%dvitīya iva bhāskaraḥ%} 12. 350. 11), appro-
ached the Sun; the Sun held out his hand to
receive him and the other being also extended
his right hand to hold the Sun's hand; then
the being entered the Sun's disc 12. 350. 8-15;
confused as to who was the real Sun—the one
in the chariot or the one that arrived from the
sky—Padma and others asked the Sun to
explain; the Sun told them that the one who
entered him was a sage who observed the vow
of {%uñchavṛtti%} (living only on grains fallen in
the field); the sage also lived successively on
fruit, roots, fallen leaves, water and air and
recited the {%ṛc%} stanzas; that Brāhmaṇa (sage)
even now moved round the earth with the Sun
—this was the wonder seen by Padma 12. 351.
1-6; the Brāhmaṇa Dharmāraṇya, on hearing
[Page037-a+ 39]
Padma's account, took leave of him without
telling him the purpose of his visit; to the
perplexed Padma, Dharmāraṇya explained
that he was only curious to know what led to
the accumulation of merit ({%puṇyasaṃcaya%});
now that he knew how one did it, he had
decided to observe {%uñchavrata;%} the purpose
of his visit was served ({%kṛtārtho 'smi%}) and
hence he was leaving 12. 352. 1-10.

the cat Lomaśa who lived on the branches
of the same banyan tree was caught in the
trap ({%unmātha%}) fixed by a Cāṇḍāla, Palita
moved about fearlessly; he got a piece of flesh
and as he was eating it after taking it on

({%manasā hasan%} 12. 136. 28) at his enemy,
trapped below, Palita saw his second enemy,
a mongoose by name Harika, approaching
the tree and looking up at his prey; Palita
at that moment, also saw a third enemy, an
owl named Candraka, prowling from his
[Page038-a+ 41]
nest situated on the branch of the same tree;
apprehending danger from both directions,
Palita decided to take help from the cat, his
foe in distress, and find escape from all the
three 12. 136. 26-42; he therefore addressed
himself to the cat pointing out that there was
danger to the life of both of them, that both
lived on the same tree and therefore deserved
to be friends of each other on the basis of
common residence ({%savāso me 'si paṇḍitaḥ%}
{%vl. paṇḍita%} 12. 136. 54), that he was prepared
to cut the cords that bound the cat provided
the cat agreed not to kill him when freed;
Palita appealed to the cat: “I wish you live,
and you should wish that I live” 12. 136.
48-62; the cat agreed to the proposal and
asked Palita to do what was suited to the
occasion; Palita swore by truth ({%satyena te%}
{%śape%} 12. 136. 73) to cut down the net pro-
vided the cat agreed not to kill him when he
descended and crawled very close to the body
of the cat ({%ahaṃ tvānupravekṣyāmi%} 12.
136. 72); when the cat agreed to this, Palita
went near the cat and rested quietly on his
chest; seeing him safe, the mongoose and the
owl returned to their residence 12. 136. 66-82;
Palita then started to cut slowly the cords of
the net; when the cat asked Palita to finish
the work quickly, Palita advised him to be
patient; Palita would complete cutting the
net only when he saw the Caṇḍāla, who had
spread the net, approach; otherwise the cat
might prove dangerous to him; if the cat,
when freed, saw the Caṇḍāla drawing near
he would immediately mount the tree and
not waste his time in jumping on the mouse;
Palita then could safely enter his hole 12. 136.
83-93; when the cat persisted in asking
Palita to make haste, Palita replied as
follows: “I have made treaty with one who
is stronger than me, I have therefore to protect
[Page038-b+ 41]
myself; no one has any regard for the doer of
a good act, once the act has been fully done;
hence all good acts must be done with a part
left unfinished ({%na hi kaś cit kṛte kārye%}
{%kartāraṃ samavekṣate / tasmāt sarvāṇi%}
{%kāryāṇi sāvaśeṣāṇi kārayet%} 12. 136. 105);
now only one cord remains; I shall cut down
that too at proper time” 12. 136. 100-107;
at dawn when the Caṇḍāla Parigha appeared,
true to his word, Palita cut off the last cord;
the freed cat, as expected by Palita, jumped up
the tree and Palita entered the hole 12. 136.
109-116; when the Caṇḍāla left the scene, the
cat asked Palita to come out of the hole and
move freely among the cats without appre-
hending any danger; he asked Palita to become
his minister and even guide him like his father
({%amātyo me bhava prājña piteva hi praśādhi%}
{%mām%}) 12. 136. 119-126; but Palita refused to
oblige; he told the cat that there were no natu-
ral friends and no natural foes; hence there
were no permanent friendships and no perma-
nent enmities; friendships and enmities arise
due to certain common or conflicting interests
({%nāsti jātyā rīpur nāma mitraṃ nāma na%}
{%vidyate / sāmarthyayogāj jāyante mitrāṇi%}
{%ripavas tathā // nāsti maitrī sthirā nāma%}
{%na ca dhruvam asauhṛdam / arthayuktyā%}
{%hi jāyante mitrāṇi ripava s tathā //%} 12. 136.
132, 134); danger arising out of misplaced
trust cuts at the very roots; the affection bet-
ween them arose for some purpose; once that
purpose was served, friendship lost its ground;
mouse was food, and cat the eater; mouse was
weak cat strong; there could be no real
conciliation ({%sandhi%}) among parties of uneven
strength; Palita said he knew that it was the
cat's food time; that was the reason why the
cat was asking Palita to stir out; Palita finally
told the cat that if he remembered Palita's
good act let him wish well of the mouse ({%śivaṃ%}
[Page039-a+ 39]
{%dhyāyasva me 'trasthaḥ sukṛtaṃ smaryate%}
{%yadi%}) 12. 136. 160-166; the cat made one
more attempt to win the confidence of Palita
and praised him 12. 136. 177-182; Palita did
not relent; he recited two {%gāthās%} of Uśanas
(apparently 12. 136. 185-186) for the benefit
of the cat the purport of which was that if one
made conciliation ({%sandhi%}) with a person
stronger than himself to face a common enemy
he should not repose trust in his partner after
the purpose was served and that in all condi-
tions one should protect one's life since wealth
and children could be acquired if one remained
alive; Palita concluded that the sum and
substance of the {%nītiśāstras%} was that distrust
was the best policy ({%saṅkṣepo nītiśāstrāṇām%}
{%aviśvāsaḥ paro mataḥ%} 12. 136. 187); Palita
finally told the cat that the mouse must protect
himself from the cat as the cat must protect
himself from the Caṇḍāla; the cat, apparently
scared at hearing the word ‘Caṇḍāla’, ran
to his hole and Palita entered another hole;
thus the intelligent Palita, all by himself,
outwitted his many stronger enemies 12. 136.

Her lustrous son grew in the palace with
the king's son. Pūjanī used to get from the
seashore two fruits, one for her son and one
for the prince; one day the prince, while play-
ing with the young bird, killed him in a
secluded place; when Pūjanī returned with
two fruits she found her young one dead; she
lamented over her son's loss and blamed the
Kṣatriyas who deserved no trust; she decided
[Page041-a+ 41]
to take revenge and pierced the eyes of the
prince with her talons; she said that a sinful
act, deliberately committed, returned quickly
on the doer and that taking revenge did not
destroy one's good and bad (?) acts ({%iccha-%}
{%yaiva kṛtaṃ pāpaṃ sadya evopasarpati /%}
{%kṛtapratikriyaṃ teṣāṃ na naśyati śubhā-%}
{%śubham%}) 12. 137. 7-19. {@D.@} King Brahma-
datta's dialogue with Pūjanī: Brahmadatta
asked Pūjanī to continue to live with him
since she had already retaliated for the
misdeed of the prince; Pūjanī did not agree
with the king saying that wise men recom-
mended abandoning the place where misdeed
was committed; enmities, once arisen, never
subsided, hence no trust should be reposed
in the enemy; the purpose for which she
lived in the palace was no longer there;
spirited men should abandon the place
where after receiving honour they are dis-
honoured; she said to the king: “I have
lived here long enough; now I go, may you
be happy” 12. 137. 21-30; the king pleaded
with her saying that when some one retali-
ated nothing wrong was committed and there-
fore Pūjanī should stay on; Pūjanī did
not consent saying that enmities never passed
off ({%nāsti vairam upakrāntam%} 12. 137. 34);
no one should feel secure with the thought
that reconciliation had come about; she
pointed out to the king five causes of
enmity: women, (ownership of) house, (bad)
speech, rivalry, and misdeed ({%strīkṛtaṃ%}
{%vāstujaṃ vāgjaṃ sasapatnāparādhajam%} 12.
137. 38); she lived with the king as long as
nothing wrong happened; once that happened,
she could trust the king no more; the king
then put the entire responsibility of what had
happened on Time (Kāla); since men were
driven to act by Time nobody did anything
wrong to any one; he had forgiven Pūjanī
[Page041-b+ 41]
for her act, so should she forgive him for
what (the prince) had done; Pūjanī retorted
saying that if Kāla was to be blamed for
everything, why did men seek to take revenge ?
Why did Gods and Asuras fight with each
other ? Why did men give and take medicines
during illness ? She injured the king's son
who had killed her son; now it was the king's
turn to capture her; men wanted birds
either for eating or for sporting; there was no
third ground for the two to come together; if
Pūjanī were to stay their enmity would
be revived every time she remembered her
son; she then recited two {%gāthās%} which
Uśanas had recited for Prahrāda (12. 137.
67-68); the purport of the {%gāthās%} was that
one who trusted the words of enemies was
killed like a honey (-seeker ?) who was killed
in a well) covered with dry grass ({%te%}
{%śraddadhānā vadhyante madhu śuṣkatṛṇair%}

{%prapāte yathā patanti tadvad ete ity arthaḥ%}
on 12. 139. 71 Bom. Ed.); enmities conti-
nued because they were told to successive
generations; when Brahmadatta further
argued that trust had to be placed some-
where to achieve one's objective or else one
would live like a dead person, Pūjanī
replied that if a person continued to run
with injured feet, his feet got more hurt;
she gave the king a long lecture on how one
should guard one's interest by remaining
alert and with constant exertion; one should
leave the place where one was dishonoured;
since Brahmadatta's son had done something
which could not be repaired she had to leave
the place; she also lectured on the king's
duties (offering protection to subjects and
not torturing them by levying heavy taxes);
having said all that Pūjanī left (12. 137.
[Page042-a+ 38]
70-108); this conversation ({%saha bhāṣītam%})
between Brahmadatta and Pūjanī narrated
by Bhīṣma to Yudhiṣṭhira (12. 137. 4-109).

place was frequented by the {%Yakṣas%} and
{%Kinnaras;%} the residence looked like the seat
of Pitāmaha ({%pitāmahasadopamam%}) 12.
163. 6-7; 11-13. {@C.@} Description: Of pure

minded ({%mahātman%} 12. 165. 7; 12. 167. 15),

‘wicked-minded’ ({%duṣṭātman%}) and ‘worst

9. {@E.@} Visits to Brahmaloka: It was
Rājadharman's practice to go to Brahma-
loka during the first twilight to pay
homage to god Brahmadeva 12. 166. 6;
on his return journey from Brahmaloka
Rājadharman used to meet his friend the
Rākṣaka king Virūpākṣa every day 12. 166.
6. {@F.@} Encounter with the Brāhmaṇa
Gautama: Once when Rājadharman
returned from Brahmaloka in the evening he
met Gautama who happened to be at his
residence 12. 163. 17; Rājadharman received
[Page048-b+ 41]
him as his guest with due rites and offered him
a seat of {%śāla%} flowers; he also gave him big
fishes from Ganges and fire (for his protec-
tion during the night); he fanned Gautama
with his wings to remove his fatigue and
then asked Gautama his {%gotra;%} Gautama
told him only his name and that he was a
Brāhmaṇa but nothing else ({%so 'bravīd%}
{%gautamo 'smīti brāhma nānyad udāharat%}
12. 164. 7); Rājadharman offered his guest
a bed of leaves, rich in fragrance and strewn
with fragrant, heavenly flowers; when Rāja-
dharman (Kāśyapa) asked him the reason
of his arrival, Gautama told him that since
he was poor he wanted to go on sea in search
of wealth; Rājadharman (Kāśyapa) told
Gautama that he need have no anxiety for
wealth, since according to Bṛhaspati, there
were four means of acquiring wealth, viz.
inheritance, luck, effort, and friend ({%catur-%}
{%vidhā hy arthagatir bṛhaspatimataṃ yathā / %}
{%pāraṃparyaṃ tathā daivaṃ karma mitram%}
{%iti prabho%} 12. 164. 12); Rājadharman, as
Gautama's friend, would help him to acquire
wealth; in the morning he asked Gautama to
go a distance of three {%yojanas%} along a par-
ticular way where, in the city Meruvraja,
lived Rājadharman's friend Virūpākṣa the
chief of the Rākṣasas ({%rākṣasādhipati%});
Rājadharman was to Virūpākṣa his brother,
relative and a dear friend; Rājadharman
always trusted Virūpākṣa ({%sa%} (i. e. Rāja-
dharman) {%hi mām āśritaḥ sadā%}) 12. 165. 8;
hence when Gautama met Virūpākṣa he was
prepared to give Gautama all that he desired
12. 163. 22-23; 12. 164. 3-16; when Gau-
tama returned from Virūpākṣa carrying with
him heavy load of gold to Rājadharman's
residence under the {%nyagrodha%} tree, the
latter welcomed Gautama and tried to
remove his fatigue by fanning him with
[Page049-a+ 41]
wings; he offered Gautama food 12. 165. 27;
Gautama thought of returning home but
since he had nothing to eat on way the
ungrateful Gautama decided to kill Rāja-
dharman who was a heap of flesh 12. 165.
31; Rājadharman had kept fire burning with
flames for the protection of Gautama at
night, and he slept by the side of Gautama
fully trusting him ({%viśvasta%}); Gautama
killed Rājadharman with a fire-brand; he
dressed the bird by removing his wings and
hair ({%sa taṃ vipakṣaromāṇaṃ kṛtvā%} 12.
166. 4) and roasted him on fire; then taking
the gold and meat with him Gautama
started off 12. 166. 1-4; when a couple of
days passed without Rājadharman's going to
meet Virūpākṣa on his way home from the
Brahmaloka, Virūpākṣa was worried about
Rājadharman's safety; he suspected that
Gautama, devoid of virtues as he was,
might have killed Rājadharman; he therefore
asked his son to visit Rājadharman's residence
and find out whether he was alive; Virū-
pākṣa's son saw near the {%nyagrodha%} tree only
a skeleton of Rājadharman; he and his as-
sociates pursued Gautama, captured him, and
returned to Virūpākṣa with the body of Rāja-
dharman which was without wings, bones and
feet ({%°śarīraṃ ca pakṣāsthicaraṇojjhitam%}
12. 166. 13) 12. 166. 5-14; Virūpākṣa lame-
nted over the loss of his friend and prepared a
funeral pyre decorated with jewels, and spread
over with perfumes and many pieces of
cloth; after kindling the pyre of Rājadharman,
Virūpākṣa performed the prescribed funeral
rites; at that time divine Surabhi, daughter
of Dakṣa, happened to stand above the pyre
(in the sky); the foam from her mouth,
mixed with milk, fell down on the burning
pyre; Rājadharman came back to life and
met Virūpākṣa; at that time Indra arrived
[Page049-b+ 40]
on the scene and was glad that Rājadharman
was alive ({%diṣṭyāyaṃ jīvatīty uta%} 12. 167.
6); Indra told them an old incident ({%purā-%}
{%tanam%} 12. 167. 7): on a certain occasion,
Rājadharman had failed to present himself
in the assembly ({%sadas%}) of Brahmadeva; the
enraged god cursed Rājadharman to die
soon ({%tasmād vadhaṃ sa duṣṭātmā nacirāt%}
{%samavāpsyati%} 12. 167. 9 [{%na cirāt%} seems to
contradict {%purātanam%}]); hence Rājadharman
was killed by Gautama, but was again
revived by Brahman by sprinkling nectar 12.
167. 1-10; since Indra was favourably dis-
posed to Rājadharman he was requested by
Rājadharman to bring Gautama back to life;
Indra revived Gautama and gave him to
Rājadharman; delighted Rājadharman em-
braced Gautama who had with him all kinds
of vessels full of gold ({%sabhāṇḍopaskaram%}
12. 167. 13); Rājadharman then took leave of
Gautama and returned home 12. 167. 11-14;
Rājadharman, as usual, visited the above of
Brahmadeva and was received with guest
worship 12. 167. 15; this narrative of Rāja-
dharman and Gautama is called {%ākhyāna%}

{@Lomaśa@}¦ m.: A cat.
{@A.@} Residence: He lived on the branches
of a banyan tree in a certain forest 12. 136. 19,

the tree 12. 136. 190. {@B.@} Description: Had

({%vākyasaṃpanna%}) and knew the import of

{@C.@} Palita-Lomaśa Episode: A mouse,
Palita, also lived in a hole at the foot of the
banyan tree; Lomaśa, although normally
watchful ({%apramatta%} 12. 136. 25), was once
caught in a trap ({%unmātha%} 12. 136. 23) fixed
by a Cāṇḍāla; when this happened Palita
began to move about freely, got a piece of
flesh, and started eating it on the top of the
trap while smiling inwardly at the cat caught
in the trap below; just then the mouse
Palita saw his two other enemies, an
ichneumon on the ground and an owl on the
tree, wanting to get him; Palita immediately
realized that the cat, his third enemy in
distress, was his only means of escape; he
therefore offered the cat to cut off the cords
[Page050-b+ 41]
of the net if the cat in return promised not
to injure him when he moved near the cat
to protect himself from the ichneumon and
the owl; Palita wished that Lomaśa remained
alive and expected a similar response from
Lomaśa ({%tava jīvitam icchāmi tvaṃ mame-%}
{%cchasi jīvitam%} 12. 136. 59); the cat too
knew that be by himself was almost at
the end of his life ({%tām avasthām avek-%}
{%ṣyāntyām%} 12. 136. 64) and hence spoke in
conciliatory terms to the mouse; Lomaśa
told the mouse that he had given up his
pride and that he was Palita's devotee and
pupil; he was prepared to carry out Palita's
order and work in his interest; he requested
Palita to do what would serve the purpose
of both of them; Palita then suggested the
following plan to Lomaśa: the mouse was
to go very close to the cat and while he
was in that condition the cat was to protect
the mouse from the owl and the ichneumon;
when the danger to the mouse from the two
had passed, the mouse was to cut the cords of
the net and free the cat; Lomaśa agreed to
this plan and promised not only to be well-
disposed towards Palita when he drew near, but
also offered later to do, with his friends and
relatives, things pleasing to Palita; the mouse
then moved very close to the cat and slept on
his chest; having seen that the ichneumon and
the owl had returned to their respective homes
Palita started to cut off the cords of the net
slowly; Lomaśa tried to hasten him asking
him not to be ungrateful; Lomaśa wanted
Palita to finish the work before the Caṇḍāla
({%śvapaca%}) returned; Palita refused to hasten
until he was sure that the Caṇḍāla was close
by so that Lomaśa, when freed, would not
pounce on the mouse but jump on the tree
from the fear of the Caṇḍāla; Lomaśa again
pleaded with Palita to be more quick in his
[Page051-a+ 41]
work pointing out that good men did not
act the way Palita was going about his
work; Palita should not remember their
past enmity and delay in freeing the cat;
Palita assured Lomaśa that he had cut off
most of the cords and deliberately left only
one which he would bite off at the proper
time; when the night ended and the Caṇḍāla
was seen arriving, Lomaśa was frightened and
asked Palita what he intended to do; Palita
cut off the last cord and the freed Lomaśa
jumped up the tree as was expected by Palita,
and Palita himself entered his hole; when the
disappointed Caṇḍāla went away, Lomaśa
requested Palita not to misunderstand him if
he, when he became free, jumped up the
tree without conversing with Palita ({%akṛtvā%}
{%saṃvidaṃ kāṃcit sahasāham upaplutaḥ /%}
{%kṛtajñaṃ kṛtakalyāṇaṃ kaccin māṃ nābhi-%}
{%śaṅkase%} 12. 136. 119); Lomaśa asked the
mouse to trust him and come close to him as
he wanted to honour Palita who had saved
him; Lomaśa asked Palita to be his minister
and instruct him like a father ({%amātyo me%}
{%bhava prājña piteva hi praśādhi mām%} 12.
136. 126); the counsel ({%mantra%}) of the mouse
and the strength ({%bala%}) of the cat together
would win victories for them (12. 136. 127);
but Palita pointed out to Lomaśa that he
fell into the trap due to his thoughtlessness
({%capalatvāt%} 12. 136. 142); thoughtlessness
does not help the person himself, how can it
help others ?; Palita plainly told the cat that
he wanted the mouse to move close to him
because he was the food of the cat; Palita
refused to go near Lomaśa when that
was the cat's dinner time; Lomaśa made one
more plea to Palita describing himself to be
the knower of duties ({%dharmajña%}), apprecia-
tive of the merits of others ({%guṇajña%}), grate-
ful for the good act ({%kṛtajña%}), and fond of
[Page051-b+ 38]
friends ({%mitreṣu vatsala%} 12. 136. 179); if the
mouse forsook the cat the latter would die;
Palita, however, remained firm and advised
Lomaśa to protect himself from the Caṇḍāla;
hearing Caṇḍāla's name, the frightened
Lomaśa quickly entered his hole, and Palita
entered his 12. 136. 21-191.

horses were yoked to his chariot; when asked

by all leaders of monkeys 3. 147. 25, 26; he
maintained a large and flourishing forest
called {%madhuvana%} 3. 266. 26. {@D.@} Encounter
[Page053-b+ 41]
with Rāma: Sugrīva, for some reason, was
offended ({%nikṛtaḥ … kasmiṃśeit kāraṇāntare%}
3. 147. 27) by Vālin; Rāma advised to take
Sugrīva's help for the recovery of Sītā
3. 263. 39; Rāma and Sugrīva entered
into an agreement: Rāma promised to
kill Vālin and Sugrīva in return promised
help in winning back Sītā 3. 264. 14-15;
when Sugrīva challenged Vālin he was not
able to stand the roars of Sugrīva; Tārā,
his wife, tried to dissuade him from going out
to punish Sugrīva; Vālin asked her to find out
and tell him whose help Sugrīva had secured;
she told him about the friendship between
Rāma and Sugrīva based on having enemies
for similar reasons (both deprived of their
wives) ({%tulyārimitratāṃ prāptaḥ sugrīveṇa%}
{%dhanurdharaḥ (rāmaḥ)%} 3. 264. 21); Vālin
disregarded Tārā's advice; he suspected her of
secretly loving Sugrīva, scolded her, and went
out of his cave ({%guhāmukha%} 3. 264. 26); he
reminded Sugrīva that he was defeated on
several occasions before but was spared be-
cause he was Vālin's kinsman ({%mukto jñātir%}
{%iti jñātvā%} 3. 264. 27); the two brothers
fought a duel with {%śāla%} and palm trees, and
rocks; they also used their fists, nails and
teeth; it was not possible to distinguish between
the two, hence Hanūmant stuck a garland on
Sugrīva's neck; Rāma was then able to single
out Vāli (3. 264. 35) for his target and
shoot an arrow on his chest; with his vitals
pierced and vomitting blood Vālin saw Rāma
at a distance; he blamed Rāma (for shoot-
ing him that way) and fell unconscious on the
ground; after Vālin's death Sugrīva received
the kingdom of Kiṣkindhā and also Tārā 3.

2. {@F.@} Role in churning of the ocean for
nectar: Vāsuki was used as the churning cord
({%netra%} 1. 16. 12; 1. 35. 4) by the gods and
the demons at the time of {%samudramanthana;%}
his one end was held by the great {%asuras,%}
the tail by all the gods; the serpent Ananta
stood near Nārāyaṇa and raised up and
threw down again and again the head of
Vāsuki; from the mouth of Vāsuki, whose
body was forcibly dragged at the time of
churning, smoky winds with fire came out
repeatedly which turned into clouds and lightn-
ings and showered rain on the gods fatigued
due to the labour of churning the ocean 1. 16.
13-16. {@G.@} Vāsuki and the snake sacrifice
of Janamejaya: When Vāsuki heard the curse
of Kadrū, the mother of serpents, that they
would be burnt in the snake sacrifice of
Janamejaya (1. 13. 35), he held consultations
with his brother Airāvata and other serpents
to think of the remedy to nullify the curse
({%śāpo 'yaṃ na bhavet katham%} 1. 33. 1); he
told them that all curses had a cure, but the
curse of a mother would be difficult to avert,
especially when the curse was uttered within
the hearing of the imperishable god (i. e.
Brahman) (cf. 1. 18. 9) and the god did not
stop her from uttering the terrible curse; yet
they had to find a way out before it was too
late; they had to see if the snake sacrifice of
Janamejaya did not get started or, if started,
it could be defeated in its purpose ({%yathā sa%}
{%yajño na bhaved yathā vāpi parābhavet%} 1.
33. 9) 1. 33. 1-9; he listened to the sugges-
tions made by serpents to avoid the snake
sacrifice but did not agree with any one of
them; he himself had nothing better to offer,
hence he was worried 1. 33. 29-31; at that time
Elāpatra informed Vāsuki that since Pitāmaha
Brahman had prophesied that the son of the
[Page055-b+ 41]
great sage Jaratkāru born of his wife having
the same name would stop the snake sacrifice
and free virtuous serpents from danger,
Vāsuki should give in marriage his sister,
who was named Jaratkāru, to the sage, when
he came begging for a maiden; that would
put an end to the fear of the serpents 1. 34.
1-18; earlier, after the churning of the ocean,
the gods had taken Vāsuki to Pitāmaha
Brahman and told him that Vāsuki was very
much disturbed due to the curse of his mother
and that Pitāmaha should free him from his
mental agony; they pointed out that Vāsuki
had always acted for the benefit of the gods
and for what was dear to them; Pitāmaha
had then told the gods that when the occasion
arrived Vāsuki should act according to the
advice of Elāpatra 1. 35. 5-7; 1. 48. 25;
1. 49. 9-13, 25; thereafter Vāsuki took great
care of his sister Jaratkāru knowing her to be
the saviour of serpents 1. 35. 2; Vāsuki appoi-
nted various serpents to watch for Jaratkāru
and report to him when Jaratkāru arrived
asking for a wife 1. 35. 12-13; when Jarat-
kāru arrived Vāsuki's attendants informed him
about Jaratkāru's intention to marry a girl
of his name and who was offered as alms;
knowing this Vāsuki approached the sage
Jaratkāru with his well-adorned sister; the
sage asked Vāsuki his sister's name and also
told him that even after marriage it would be
Vāsuki's responsibility to maintain her 1. 42.
16-20; Vāsuki assured Jaratkāru that his
sister had the same name as the sage and
that he would support her even after marriage
with all his might 1. 42. 16-20; 1. 43. 1-2;
1. 13. 30-34; Jaratkāru then went to Vāsuki's
residence and married his sister; Jaratkāru
went with his wife to the shining house
({%vāsagṛhaṃ śubhram%} 1. 43. 5) approved by
Vāsuki 1. 43. 3-5; when the sage Jaratkāru
[Page056-a+ 41]
left his wife he asked her to inform Vāsuki
about his departure and that he had lived
happily with him 1. 43. 29; Jaratkāru's wife
pleaded with the sage that he should not
abandon her; he should realize what Vāsuki
would feel if he knew that her husband had
left her without blessing her with a son—
that being the principal purpose of their
marriage—1. 43. 32-34; when Vāsuki knew
about Jaratkāru's departure he was sorry;
but he would not pursue the sage fearing that
he might curse him; he knew it was improper
to ask his sister if she was with a child from
Jaratkāru but the seriousness of the matter
prompted him to do that ({%kiṃ hi kārya-%}
{%garīyastvāt tatas tvāham acūcudam%} 1. 44.
6); Vāsuki's sister assured him that she had
conceived from Jaratkāru and that a lustrous
son will be born to her; she removed his
anxiety; on hearing the news Vāsuki was
happy; he honoured his sister by giving gifts 1.
44. 1-15; later when the snake sacrifice began
Vāsuki was highly disturbed due to the death
of a large number of serpents and feared that
he himself might fall into the fire; he there-
fore told his sister Jaratkāru that the time
had came for her son Āstīka to intervene and
stop the destruction of the snakes 1. 48. 19-
26; accordingly Jaratkāru asked her son to ful-
fil the purpose for which she was married to
Jaratkāru; on enquiry, Jaratkāru told Āstīka
why Vāsuki gave her to the sage Jaratkāru 1.
49. 1-15; Āstīka assured Vāsuki, who was
terribly upset, that he would release him from
the curse and remove his fear 1. 49. 17-21;
when Vāsuki again expressed his anxiety by
saying that he felt he was revolving, that
his heart was bursting, and that he had lost
sense of directions as he was afflicted by
the punishment inflicted by Brahman ({%āstīka%}
{%parighūrṇāmi hṛdayaṃ me vidīryate / diśaś%}
[Page056-b+ 40]
{%ca na prajānāmi brahmadaṇḍanipīḍitaḥ%} 1.
49. 22), Āstika reassured him that he would
destroy Vāsuki's fear of {%brahmadaṇḍa%} 1. 49.
22-24; later after accomplishing his difficult
task Āstīka returned to his mother and
maternal uncle (Vāsuki) and reported to
them all that had happened at Janamejaya's
snake sacrifice; all the serpents present
were happy to receive the news 1. 53. 17-18.
{@H.@} Functions and Events: (1) He is
one of the {%nāgas%} who wait upon Varuṇa in
his {%sabhā%} without feeling fatigue 2. 9. 8, 11;
(2) present among those who arrived to greet
the birth of Arjuna 1. 114. 60; (3) he sided
with Arjuna when those who had gathered in
the mid-region to watch the battle took sides
between Arjuna and Karṇa 8. 63. 36; (4) he
was one of the snakes who received the white
serpent issuing from Balarāma's mouth and
entering the ocean 16. 5. 14, 12; (5) after
Skanda's consecration as the leader of the
army (9. 43. 48) and when gifts were given
to Skanda, Vāsuki gave him two snakes,
Jaya and Mahājaya 9. 44. 48; (6) when
Uttaṅka blew into the anus of the horse
(god Fire), the house of Vāsuki and other
prominent snakes in the {%nāgaloka%} were cover-
ed with smoke 14. 57. 46-47.

{@A.@} Family: One of the two daughters
of Prajāpati, sister of Kadrū (1. 19. 1),
both married to Kaśyapa 1. 14. 5-6; one
of the thirteen daughters of Dakṣa 1. 59.
12-13; hence called Dākṣāyaṇī 1. 27. 24.
{@B.@} Description: Divine ({%devī%}) 1. 14. 15;
beautiful, wonderful and faultless 1. 14. 5;
[Page057-a+ 40]
shining ({%śubhā,%} also 1. 14. 5), auspicious
({%kalyāṇī%}) and famous ({%yaśasvinī%}) 1. 27. 24.
{@C.@} Progeny: (1) Kaśyapa, her husband,
granted her a boon (also 1. 31. 2); she chose
to have two sons, stronger than the sons of
Kadrū; but the husband granted her one and a
half sons as desired ({%? adhyardhaṃ putram%}
{%īpsitam%} 1. 14. 9) [thus in view of the fact that
one of her two sons was not fully developed ?
1. 14. 16; 1. 27. 34]; when the husband said
“so be it”, Vinatā was delighted to know
that she will have two strong sons 1. 14. 6-
10; after a long time Vinatā laid two eggs
which were preserved for five hundred years
in warm pots by the female attendants
({%sopasvedeṣu bhāṇḍeṣu%} 1. 14. 13; Nī. {%sopas-%}
{%vedeṣu uṣmavatsu%} on 1. 16. 15 Bom. Ed.);
when after five hundred years Kadrū's sons
came out of the eggs but nothing came out of
the two eggs laid by Vinatā, she, ashamed and
desirous of quickly having a son, broke one
of the two eggs and saw her partly developed
son; angered, the son cursed his mother (also
1. 31. 1) for her impatience, to become the
slave ({%dāsī%} 1. 14. 17) of Kadrū with whom she
vied; he also told the mother that her second
son will free her from slavery if she did not
break the other egg prematurely and produce
a son deficient in limbs; the undeveloped son
became Aruṇa; her second son, Garuḍa, was
born at proper time; as soon as born he left
Vinatā and flew into the sky 1. 14. 12-22; 1.
26. 36; (2) Vinatā, desirous of having a son,
practised penance and observed vows; having
bathed and become pure she approached her
husband Kaśyapa for bringing forth a male
child; Kaśyapa told her that her effort would
succeed and that she would give birth to heroic
sons; he also told her to carefully bear the
{%garbha;%} Vinatā delighted when thus addressed
[Page057-b+ 40]
by her husband; she gave birth to Aruṇa and
Garuḍa 1. 27. 24-28; 33-34; hence Aruṇa
and Garuḍa called {%vainateyau%} ‘sons of
Vinatā’ 1. 31. 2 (See Garuḍa); (3) the two
sons born due to the penance of Vālakhilyas
and the conception of Kaśyapa ({%tapasā vāla-%}

Garuḍa, Tārkṣya, Ariṣṭanemi, Āruṇi, Vāruṇi
also called {%vainateyāḥ%} 1. 59. 39; 1. 114. 62
(with slight difference, Asitadhvaja in place
of Vāruṇi); the line of Suparṇas descending
from her ({%vinatākula%}), of noble family,
propagated by Garuḍa through his six sons
5. 99. 1-4; [See Vainateya<sup>1</sup>]. {@D.@} Slave
of Kadrū: Once the two sisters Kadrū and
Vinatā happened to see the horse Uccaiḥ-
śravas from very near 1. 15. 1; Kadrū
later asked Vinatā the colour of the horse;
Vinatā declared it to be white and asked
Kadrū's opinion; Vinatā was ready to put a
wager on it; Kadrū declared that the horse
had dark hair on its tail; the two agreed to
lay a wager with slavery as stake; they then
went home agreeing to inspect the horse the
next day 1. 18. 2-5; next morning the two
sisters went to inspect Uccaiḥśravas from
near; they crossed the ocean on the way 1.
19. 1-3; when they found that there were
many black hair on the tail of Uccaiḥśravas,
Kadrū made Vinatā her slave; Vinatā who
lost the bet and was defeated was grieved
to be reduced to the condition of a slave 1.
20. 1-3; 1. 49. 6; once when Garuḍa visited
the slave Vinatā on the other shore of the
ocean, Kadrū asked Vinatā in the presence
of Garuḍa to take her to the beautiful
Rāmaṇīyaka, the abode of the {%nāgas%} in the
middle of the ocean; Vinatā did as command-
[Page058-a+ 40]
ed and Garuḍa, as directed by his mother,
carried the serpents 1. 21. 1-5; Garuḍa asked
Vinatā why he must act as told by the ser-
pents; Vinatā informed him that she having
lost the wager had become the slave of her
sister; the serpents, on being asked by Garuḍa
how he (and his mother) could be free from
slavery, told him to get {%amṛta%} for them
to win freedom from slavery 1. 23. 8-12;
Garuḍa got ready to fetch {%amṛta%} and
asked Vinatā what he might eat on way;
Vinatā asked him to eat the Niṣādas whose
abode lay far away in the middle of the ocean
({%samudrakukṣāv ekānte%} 1. 24. 2), and warned
him never to injure a Brāhmaṇa 1. 24. 1-3;
on being further asked by Garuḍa how he
could recognize a Brāhmaṇa, Vinatā told him:
“who, when swallowed, burns your throat like
a heated charcoal, know him to be a Brāh-
maṇa”; then Vinatā, although she knew the
incomparable prowess of her son, blessed him
as follows: “May Wind protect your wings,
Moon your back, Fire your head, and Sun
the whole of you; myself shall always endeav-
our for your comfort and well-being ({%śānti-%}
{%svastiparāyaṇā%} 1. 24. 9); may your path
be free from obstacles and may you succeed
in your task” 1. 24. 5-9; on way Garuḍa
met his father and told him that he was on his
way to fetch {%soma%} in order to free his mother
from slavery; he also told him that he was
asked by Vinatā to eat the Niṣādas but was
not satisfied even after eating thousands of
them; he asked Kaśyapa what else he might
eat 1. 25. 7-9; when Garuḍa succeeded in
getting {%soma (amṛta)%} he approached his
mother and told the serpents that since he
was leaving the {%amṛta%} for them on {%kuśa%} grass
his mother should be freed from slavery from
that day; the serpents said: “so be it”;
[Page058-b+ 38]

lived together in a shallow pond which
[Page060-a+ 40]
abounded in fish; one of them was characteri-
zed as Prāptakālajña ‘who knows the proper
time (for action), who has the presence of
mind’ (also called Saṃpratipattijña, Prati-
pattimant, or Saṃpratipattimant 12. 135. 9,
13, 15), the other as Dīrghadarśin ‘who has
forethought’, and the third as Dīrghasūtra
‘who procrastinates’; seeing, once, the water
level falling down, Dīrghadarśin apprehended
danger and told his friends that they had
better quickly move out before their way to
get out was cut off; Dīrghasūtra agreed with
him but saw no reason to make haste;
Saṃpratipattijña, however, said that he
would not fail to take the correct course when
time arrived; then Dīrghadarśin, of great
intelligence, went out alone to a deep lake
following a water current; when the water in
the lake had thoroughly flown out the fisher-
men began to catch the fish by various
means; Dīrghasūtra got caught with others;
when the fish that were caught were being tied
to strings, Pratipattimant got himself mixed
with those that were tied already and he held
the string tight with his mouth (and thus
escaped being actually tied by the string);
when the fish, thus tied, were being washed
in dirt-free water, Saṃprattimant gave up
the string and escaped; the dull-witted and
of low intelligence Dīrghasūtra, however,
invited death on himself; thus one who does
not recognize the most opportune time is
destroyed like Dīrghasūtra; one like Saṃpra-
tipattimant, who does not provide for his
welfare in advance thinking himself to be
clever, meets with danger; who, like Dīrgha-
darśin, adopts proper course before the danger
sets in, attains great bliss; this excellent

{%bhogavarṣmā / raktānanaḥ%}) where appare-
ntly Śeṣa is meant, but is not directly named
16. 5. 12-13. {@C.@} Śeṣa's austerities and
meeting with Brahmadeva: Śesa deserted
his mother Kadrū and visited the slopes of
the Himālayas; there on the Gandhamādana
mountain and in Badarī, as also at other holy
places like Gokarṇa, Puṣkarāraṇya and in
various {%tīrthas%} and holy abodes ({%āyataneṣu%}
1. 32. 4) Śeṣa practised severe austerities
living on wind and observing difficult vows;
he lived all alone and had controlled his
[Page062-b+ 40]
senses ({%ekāntaśīlī, vijitendriyaḥ%} 1. 32. 4);
during the austerities he put on bark garments
and wore matted hair; his flesh, skin and
sinews dried up; when Pitāmaha Brahman,
saw Śeṣa in this condition he asked him to
do something beneficial to the people instead
of tormenting them by his severe austerities;
he asked Śeṣa the reason for undertaking the
austerities; Śeṣa told Pitāmaha that his
serpent brothers were dull-witted; they envied
each other and did not suffer either Vinatā
or her son (Vainateya Garuḍa) who was
their cousin; they hated Garuḍa; Śeṣa there-
fore did not want to see his brothers nor live
with them; Śeṣa undertook austerities to give
up his body and to avoid the company of his
brothers in the next life; he asked Pitāmaha's
permission to do that 1. 32. 5-12; Brahman
told Śeṣa that his brothers faced danger
because they had offended their mother but
that incident had been taken care of; since
Śeṣa was devoted to righteousness ({%diṣṭyā%}
{%ca buddhir dharme te%} 1. 32. 16), Pitāmaha
offered him a boon 1. 32. 13-16; Śeṣa
desired to find pleasure in righteousness
({%dharma%}), equanimity ({%śama%}), and austerity
({%tapas%}) 1. 32. 17. {@D.@} Śeṣa as supporter
of the earth: Brahman was pleased with Śeṣa's
self-control and equanimity and asked him
to collect the earth properly and hold it so
that it became steady for the benefit of the
creatures; Śeṣa agreed to do what Brahman
desired and asked Brahman to place the
earth on his head; Brahman asked him to go
below the earth for which earth would
provide an opening ({%vivara%}) 1. 32. 21-22;
Śeṣa entered the earth through a cleft and
held the divine ({%devī%}) earth, girdled by the
oceans, after enclosing it on all sides; he made
the earth firm 1. 32. 19-22; 5. 101. 2; 6. 63.

earth 1. 32. 24; Brahman gave to Śeṣa Vaina-
teya Suparṇa (i. e. Garuḍa) as his friend
1. 32. 25. {@E.@} Association with Viṣṇu
Nārāyaṇa: Nārāyaṇa told Mārkaṇḍeya that
he, having become Śeṣa, supports the earth
surrounded by the four oceans and adorned
by Meru and Mandara 3. 187. 10; when the
entire creation, both moving and non-moving,
gets lost in one single ocean, god Viṣṇu Nārā-
yaṇa sleeps alone on the bed of water on the
huge body of Śeṣa; at that time with Śeṣa's
great coil Viṣṇu encompasses the whole earth

advised them to enter a nearby hole, but
they refused for the fear of a mouse; the

intelligent, we are in danger to our life;
there is no doubt that only one among

praised god Fire; when his turn came Sāri-
sṛkva drew the attention of god Fire to their
condition (deserted by parents; their wings
not grown) and appealed to him to save
them since they had no other saviour; Agni
should protect them that were seeking shelter

some reason, he lived with his four counse-

3. 266. 65) on the mountain Ṛśyamūka,
near Pampā; Hanūmant specially became

Meeting with Rāma: Gandharva Viśvāvasu
advised Rāma to approach Sugrīva for help
in his search for Sītā and gave him
Sugrīva's address who lived with his four
counsellors on the mountain Ṛśyamūka, near
Pampā; according to Viśvāvasu Sugrīva
knew Rāvaṇa's whereabouts 3. 263. 39-42;
[Page068-b+ 40]
Lakṣmaṇa while comforting Rāma who was
grieving over Sītā's loss suggested to meet
Sugrīva; they saw Sugrīva and four other
monkeys ({%vānarān pañca%} 3. 264. 9) on the
Ṛśyamūka mountain (also 3. 147. 31);
Sugrīva sent Hanūmant to them; having
talked with him, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa
approached Sugrīva and became friends (also
3. 147. 32; 3. 264. 57, 60; 3. 266 62);
the monkeys showed to Rāma Sītā's upper
garment ({%vāsaḥ%} 3. 264. 12) which inspired
confidence in him; Rāma consecrated Sugrīva
as the chief of the monkeys ({%sugrīvaṃ plava-%}
{%gādhipam / pṛthivyāṃ vānaraiśvarye svayaṃ%}
{%rāmo 'bhyaṣecayat%} 3. 264. 13; 3. 266. 6);
Rāma promised to kill Vālin in battle and
Sugrīva promised help in getting back Sītā
(also 3. 258. 3); Sugrīva then went to
Kiṣkindhā and roared near Vālin's residence
to challenge him for a fight; when asked by
Vālin whose help Sugrīva had secured his
wife Tārā told him that Rāma had become
friend of Sugrīva since both had comparable
enemies ({%tulyārimitratāṃ prāptaḥ%} 3. 264.
21); when told further by Tārā that Sugrīva
and others were quite capable of destroying
Vālin, he suspected that Tārā loved Sugrīva;
Vālin went out of his residence and reminded
Sugrīva that formerly on many occasions he
had defeated Sugrīva but not killed him since
Sugrīva was his kinsman ({%mukto jñātir iti%}
{%jñātvā%} 3. 264. 27); Sugrīva, while alerting
Rāma, retorted that although Vālin had
deprived Sugrīva of his kingdom and his wife
he wanted to show him how much of his life-
force still remained with him ({%hṛtadārasya%}
{%me rājan hṛtarājyasya ca tvayā / kiṃ nu%}
{%jīvitasāmarthyam iti viddhi samāgatam%} 3.
264. 29); the two brothers were then engaged
in a duel; during the fight, the one could not be
[Page069-a+ 40]
distinguished from the other; hence Hanūmant
put a garland around the neck of Sugrīva;
Sugrīva with garland around his neck com-
pared with the great mountain Malaya circled
by a garland of clouds (3. 264. 34); Rāma
then could correctly aim arrow at Vālin; when
Vālin died Sugrīva got Kiṣkindhā and Tārā
(also 3. 147. 32); when Rāma lived on the
mountain Mālyavant, Sugrīva waited on him
(3. 264. 1-40; 3. 266. 1); Rāma suspected
Sugrīva to have become ungrateful ({%kṛtaghna%}
3. 266. 8) and hence not active in making
efforts to find Sītā ({%anudyukta%} 3. 266. 10);
he abused him as the very low in his family
({%kulādhama%}), foolish ({%mūḍha%}) and an
outcaste among the monkeys ({%vānarāpasada%})
3. 266. 6, 8; Rāma wanted Lakṣmaṇa to
remind Sugrīva that he had killed Vālin for
Sugrīva's sake and if he did not want to fulfil
the agreement ({%na jānīte samayapratipāda-%}
{%nam%} 3. 266. 9), Rāma would send him also
along the path of Vālin; if, on the other hand,
Sugrīva wanted to exert himself for Rāma's
cause, he should present himself before Rāma;
Lakṣmaṇa was received by Sugrīva and his
wife with all humility; with folded hands
Sugrīva informed Lakṣmaṇa that he was
neither ungrateful nor dull-witted; he had not
remained idle and had sent monkeys in all
directions in search of Sītā (also 3. 147. 32-
33); they have been asked to report back
within a month, and Rāma would get the
good news within five days; Lakṣmaṇa was
happy to learn this and he honoured Sugrīva;
the two then met Rāma on the Mālyavant;
the monkeys informed Sugrīva that Hanū-
mant, Aṅgada and other monkey-chiefs
who were sent to the south had returned
and were enjoying the Madhuvana; from
their behaviour Sugrīva inferred that they
[Page069-b+ 40]
must have been successful in their mission
and informed Rāma accordingly; Hanūmant
and others met Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa, and
Sugrīva and bowed to them 3. 266. 5-32;
being friend of Rāma Sugrīva had enquired
through Hanūmant about the welfare of Sītā;
Sītā had heard of Sugrīva from the Rākṣasa
Avindhya 3. 266. 62, 65. {@F.@} Part in
the war with Rāvaṇa: At the instance of
Sugrīva many monkey-chiefs came with their
troops to help Rāma in war; they encamped
near Kiṣkindhā with the consent of Sugrīva;
on an auspicious day, under a favourable
constellation, and at an approved hour ({%tithau%}
{%praśaste nakṣatre muhūrte cābhipūjīte%}
3. 267. 14), Rāma and Sugrīva marched
towards the south; when they reached the
ocean Rāma held consultations with Sugrīva
about the means to cross the ocean 3. 267. 1,
13-15, 23-24; when Vibhīṣaṇa came to
Rāma, Sugrīva suspected him of being a
spy 3. 267. 47; during the war Sugrīva
fought a duel with Virūpākṣa 3. 269. 8; when
Kumbhakarṇa struck terror in the hearts of
Tāra and the other monkey-chiefs, Sugrīva
attacked Kumbhakarṇa and struck him on
his head with a Śāla tree; but this had no
effect on the demon; Kumbhakarṇa over-
powered Sugrīva and tried to forcibly take
him away; seeing that, Lakṣmaṇa attacked
Kumbhakarṇa 3. 271. 6-10; after Kumbha-
karṇa's death Rāvaṇa sent Indrajit to kill
Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa, and Sugrīva 3. 272. 2, 5;
Sugrīva with other monkey-chiefs surrounded
Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa when they fell on the
ground struck by the arrows of Indrajit;
Sugrīva rid them of arrows with the powerful
{%viśalyā%} herb and by using a divine spell ({%viśal-%}
{%yayā mahauṣadhyā divyamantraprayuktayā%}
3. 273. 6); Sugrīva with others, applied
[Page070-a+ 38]
water sent by Kubera to the eyes so that
they could see invisible beings 3. 273. 3, 6, 7.
{@G.@} After the war: Rāma crossed the ocean
back to Kiṣkindhā with Sugrīva and his
other ministers ({%yathāmukhyair amātyaiḥ%}
3. 275. 52) in the Puṣpaka {%vimāna;%} they
all then went to Ayodhyā; when Rāma was
consecrated on the throne he consented to the
departure of Sugrīva and others to their homes
3. 275. 50-59, 66. {@H.@} Comparisons: Fight
between Bhīma and Kirmīra, between Bhīma
and Jaṭāsura, and between Ghaṭotkaca and
Alāyudha compared to the one between

(dark ?) like a cloud ({%jīmūtasaṃkāśān%}
{%nāgāt%} 7. 27. 24). {@B.@} Part in the epic
war: Ordered by Bhīsma, Bhagadatta with
his elephant in rut (not named) rushed against
Bhīma; Abhimanyu and other heroes pierced
the elephant with arrows; incited, the elephant
ran with double speed; the rutting elephant,
goaded by Bhagadatta, attacked with double
speed the Pāṇḍava warriors like the God of
Death; seeing his big form all the great
warriors on the side of the Pāṇḍavas became
uneasy 6. 60. 37-44; Ghaṭotkaca drove his
elephant against Bhagadatta in order to kill
him and his elephant; the other elephants
driven by the Rākṣasas also attacked Bhaga-
datta's elephant with tusks; afflicted by the
attack and pierced with arrows, Bhagadatta's
elephant roared loudly like a thunder; hearing
it Bhīṣma reported to Droṇa and Duryodhaṇa
that Bhagadatta must be in danger 6. 60. 53-
57; in another battle between Bhagadatta and
Ghaṭotkaca, the latter tried to kill the former's
elephant (Supratīka not named, referred to as
{%prāgjyotiṣagaja%}) with a {%śakti,%} but it was cut
into three pieces by Bhagadatta 6. 79. 37-38;
Bhagadatta, mounted on Supratīka, attacked
the Pāṇḍava heroes (6. 91. 23); Bhagadatta,
seated on Supratīka's head ({%supratīkaśiro-%}
{%gataḥ%} 6. 91. 33), ichor flowing from Supra-
tīka's temples in seven streams, attacked
[Page071-a+ 40]
Bhīma 6. 91. 31-33, 37; Pāṇḍava warriors
encircled Supratīka on all sides; Supratīka
attacked by the mountain-like elephant of the
king of the Daśārṇa country 6. 91. 40, 42;
Bhagadatta goaded his elephant Supratīka
with his hook and toe ({%aṅkuśāṅguṣṭhanuditaḥ%}
{%sa gajapravaro yudhi%} 6. 91. 52); running
hither and thither Supratīka crushed chariots,
horses together with their riders, and foot-
soldiers in hundreds and thousands; as a
result the Pāṇḍava army squeezed like a piece
of skin placed on fire; in order to kill Supra-
tīka Ghaṭotkaca hurled his {%śūla%} against
him, but Bhagadatta protected him by
cutting down the {%śūla%} 6. 91. 53-54, 57-58;
Bhagadatta, with his Supratīka crushing
the Pāṇḍava army, rushed towards Yudhi-
ṣṭhira 6. 91. 79; Arjuna with great effort
checked the advance of Supratīka and pierced
him with sharp arrows made of {%ayas%} 6.
112. 55, 57; in the fight of Bhagadatta with
Bhīma, the former's elephant (Supratīka
not named) appeared to kill Bhīma 7. 25.
19-24; Bhagadatta on his elephant fought the
army of the Pāṇḍavas and the Pāñcālas 7.
25. 24-27, and the army led by Yudhiṣṭhira
7. 25. 32-41; Bhagadatta's elephant took
hold of Sātyaki's chariot and hurled it away
7. 25. 36; in the encounter between Bhaga-
datta's elephant and the elephant of the king
of Daśārṇas the former proved victorious 7. 25.
28-30; in the encounter between Bhīma and
Bhagadatta, the latter's elephant frightened
Bhīma's horses by sprinkling water on them
7. 25. 43; he shattered the charioteer of
Yuyutsu by stepping on his horses 7. 25.
49; Bhagadatta charged his elephant against
Kṛṣṇa and Arjuṇa to kill them; seeing him
rush like the angry God of Death, Kṛṣṇa
avoided frontal attack by quickly driving
[Page071-b+ 40]
Arjuna's chariot around the elephant keeping
him on the right ({%cakre 'pasavyaṃ tvaritaḥ%}
{%syandanena janārdanaḥ%} 7. 27. 28); although
Supratīka was within his reach, Arjuna, rem-
embering the rule (of the war), did not kill
the elephant together with Bhagadatta from
behind ({%saṃprāptam api neyeṣa parāvṛttaṃ%}
{%mahādvipam / sārohaṃ mṛtyusātkartuṃ%}
{%smaran dharmaṃ dhanaṃjayaḥ%} 7. 27. 29);
Bhagadatta's elephant then sent many
elephants and horses to death and crushed
the chariots 7. 27. 27-30. {@C.@} Supratīka
not named: As in some of the above
accounts, at some other places also Bhaga-
datta is mentioned with his elephant without
naming the elephant; at all such places
obviously Supratīka is meant: 5. 164. 38;
6. 17. 36; 6. 60. 53, 59; 6. 79. 37, 41;

3, 5; 7. 27. 21-24; 27-30; 7. 28. 3, 8.
{@D.@} Comparisons: (1) with mountain: (a)
Supratīka with ichor issuing out at seven
places compared with a mountain with water
flowing down on all sides 6. 91. 32; (b)
pierced by arrows and blood issuing from his
body, Supratīka looked like Himavant
coloured with red minerals ({%dhātucitra%}
{%ivādrirāṭ%}) 6. 91. 41; (c) fight between
Supratīka and the elephant of the king
of Daśārṇas compared with that of two
winged mountains 7. 25. 29; (d) Bhaga-
datta's elephant frightened the enemies as
formerly the chief winged mountain frightened
(its enemies ?) 7. 25. 56; (e) Bhagadatta's
elephant devoid of his armour looked like the
king of the mountains bereft of clouds 7. 28. 8;
(2) with other elephants: (a) Supratīka
with Bhagadatta seated on him and shooting
arrows compared with Airāvata with Indra
seated on him and sending down streams of
[Page072-a+ 40]
water 6. 91 33, (5. 16. 38); (b) Bhaga-
datta on elephant destroying Pāṇḍava army
compared with Indra on his Airāvata destroy-
ing the Dānavas 7. 25. 40; (c) Bhagadatta's
elephant crushed the Pāṇḍava army as a
wild elephant crushes a host of lotuses 6. 79.
41; (3) with cloud: Bhagadatta's elephant
pierced by arrows looked like a big cloud
penetrated by sun's rays 7. 25. 52; (4) with
ocean: Bhagadatta's elephant frightened the
enemies as ocean frightens the merchants 7. 25.
56; (5) with shore of the ocean: Supratīka
checked the onslaught of the elephant of the
Daśārṇa king as the shore checks the advance
of the ocean 6. 91. 43; (6) with arrow:
Supratīka, discharged against Bhīma, sped
like an arrow discharged from the bow-string
6. 91. 37; (7) with fire: Supratīka goaded
by Bhagadatta looked like the Saṃvartaka
fire 6. 91. 52. {@E.@} End: Bhagadatta, with
his elephant Supratīka, was killed ({%śasta%})
by Arjuna 1. 2. 161; in the final encounter of
Bhagadatta with Arjuna, the latter cut down
the armour of Bhagadatta's elephant (Su-
pratīka not named) 7. 28. 8; he struck the
elephant between the temples with the {%nārāca%}
arrow; the arrow went deep upto its feathered
part; with the limbs stiffened and the tusks
piercing the ground, the elephant fell down;
he died roaring aloud 7. 28. 37, 39.

[Page073-b+ 40]
the proposal but he was distressed because
Garuḍa had announced his intention to eat up
Sumukha after a month 5. 102. 15; 5. 103. 5;
the threat was bound to come true as Garuḍa
wanted to feed his large progeny by killing
Sumukha 5. 102. 16; 5. 103. 5; Mātali then
proposed to take Sumukha with him to meet
Indra and make effort to prolong the remaining
life-span of Sumukha and thwart Garuḍa in
carrying out his threat 5. 102. 17-21; Viṣṇu,
who happened to be present when all met
Indra, asked Indra to give {%amṛta%} to Sumukha
and make him (immortal) like other gods;
Viṣṇu desired Sumukha and the rest to get
what they wanted; Indra, however, asked
Viṣṇu himself to give {%amṛta%} to Sumukha;
when asked by Viṣṇu again, Indra gave only
long life ({%āyur uttamam%} 5. 102. 27) to
Sumukha but not {%amṛta;%} on obtaining the
boon Sumukha's face shone with brilliance
({%labdhvā varaṃ tu sumukhaḥ sumukhaḥ%}
{%saṃbabhūva ha%} 5. 102. 28); having obtained
wife as desired Sumukha went home 5. 102.
23-28; Garuḍa was extremely angry to
know that he was deprived of Sumukha; he
blamed Indra for acting as he willed and
announced that since Sumukha was no longer
available to him he would not kill any other
serpent 5. 103. 1, 2, 6, 15.

{@A.@} Origin: (1) Daughter of Dakṣa,
hence called Dākṣāyaṇī 1. 93. 8 (Surabhī);
12. 167. 3; 13. 82. 26; once, (Dakṣa) Pra-

fragrance ({%surabhi%}) while belching; he saw

Daughter of Brahman 13. 128. 10 (Surabhī).
{@B.@} Description: {%devī%} ‘divine’ 1. 93. 8; 2.
11. 29; 13. 82. 30, 31, 34; 13. 151. 7 and

({%amṛtadhenuṃ payomucam / sā sṛṣṭā … kṣa-%}
{%ramāṇā payo'mṛtam%} 13. 128. 10); Surabhi

born to her, Surūpā, Haṃsakā, Subhadrā and
Sarvakāmadughā, dwell in four directions
protecting and guarding them 5. 100. 7-10;
mother of bulls 3. 10. 7. {@E.@} Eminence:
(1) The Goloka granted to Surabhī by Brah-
man stands above the three worlds; as
decreed by Brahman, Surabhī was to get there
all human and divine enjoyments and happi-
ness of dwelling in heaven; her worlds are
provided with all objects of desire and neither
death, nor old age, nor fire steps in there;
neither wretchedness nor inauspiciousness is
met with in the Goloka; the Goloka could be
obtained by mortals only by practising great
austerities and doing good deeds 13. 82. 37-
40; (2) She is mentioned in the {%daivata-%}
{%vaṃśa%} narrated by Bhīṣma to Yudhiṣṭhira;
recitation of this {%vaṃśa%} destroys sin 5. 151.
7, 2; (3) She is mentioned among those
who are present in the {%sabhā%} of Brahmadeva
2. 11. 29. {@F.@} Functions: Residing in
the {%rasātala,%} the seventh world of the earth,
she lets milk flow continually which is pro-
duced from the essence of the earth and
which, as a {%rasa,%} constitutes the essence of
all the six {%rasas;%} out of her milk, falling on
the earth, is created the sea of milk; water of
the ocean that was churned by the gods and
the demons was mixed with the milk of
Surabhi and her four daughters; milk oozing
from Surabhi provides nectar ({%sudhā%}) to
those whose food is {%sudhā, svadhā%} for the
manes, and {%amṛta%} for those who live on
{%amṛta%} 5, 100. 1, 2, 4, 7-13. {@G.@} Events:
(1) Seeing Aditi practising severe austerities,
Surabhi did the same on the peak of the
Kailāsa mountain, standing on one foot and
resorting to the highest {%yoga%} ({%paramaṃ%}
{%yogam āsthitā%} 13. 82. 28); this she did for ten
thousand and ten hundred years; tormented by
[Page075-a+ 40]
her austerities, gods, big snakes ({%mahora-%}
{%gāḥ%}), and sages went to her with Brahman;
Brahman asked her the reason for practising
austerities and granted her a boon; Surabhī
({%surabhy uvāca%}) did not ask for anything
saying that Brahman's satisfaction with her
austerities was as good as a boon; since
Surabhī (13. 82. 33) practised austerities not
craving for anything ({%alobhakāmyayā tapasā%}
13. 82. 34) Brahman granted her immortality
and a world of her own to be known as Goloka
12. 82. 26 35; this narration forms part of an
old Itihāsa which includes a dialogue between
Pitāmaha and Indra 13. 82. 6; (2) Surabhi
once went to heaven and cried aloud; Indra
took pity on her and asked her why she was
crying; she wept for her son, the bull, who
though weak and emaciated was forced to
draw the plough and was pierced with a goad;
one of the two bulls yoked to the plough was
strong and it carried the yoke ahead of the
other ({%? ekas tatra balopeto dhuram udvahate%}
{%'dhikām%} 3. 10. 12); the other who was weak
and lean bore the burden with difficulty;
Surabhi grieved because of the torture of the
weak bull; when Indra asked her that while
she had thousands of sons who were tortured
why did she weep over a particular one,
Surabhi replied that all her sons were equal
to her but she had more compassion for the
weak; on hearing what Surabhī (3. 10. 17)
had said Indra realized that a son was
more than one's life; narrating this, Vyāsa
advised Dhṛtarāṣṭra to adopt the attitude of
Surabhi and have more sympathy for those
among his sons who were reduced to a
wretched condition (i. e. for the Pāṇḍavas) 3.
10. 5-19; the dialogue between Surabhi and
Indra called a great and excellent {%ākhyāna%}
({%mahad ākhyānam uttamam / surabhyāś%}
[Page075-b+ 40]
{%caiva saṃvādam indrasya ca viśāṃ pate%}
3. 10. 6); (3) Surabhi, while taking the
oath to prove that she had not stolen the
lotus ({%puṣkara%}) of Agastya said: “let
(the cow) who has stolen your {%puṣkara%} be
milked with her feet tied by the rope made
from {%balvaja,%} the milk-pot used to collect
milk be made of {%kāṃsya,%} and the calf used
to induce her to give milk be not her own”
13. 96. 41; (4) Surabhi happened to stand
in the sky when the body of Rājadharman
(the king of the cranes) was being cremated
by his Rākṣasa friend; milk streamed from
her udder ({%sā babhūva payasvinī%}), and foam
from her mouth mixed with milk dropped down
on the body of Rājadharman which brought
him back to life 12. 167. 1-5; (5) Once, froth
from the mouth of Surabhī's (13. 128. 10)
calf fell on Śiva's body; angered, Śiva burnt
all the cows who then became of different
colours; Brahman ({%lokaguru%}) pacified Śiva
and gave the bull (i. e. that calf) to Śiva
to serve him as vehicle and as a distinguishing
mark on his banner ({%vṛṣaṃ cemaṃ dhvajā-%}
{%rthaṃ me dadau vāhanam eva ca%}) 13. 128.
11-12. {@H.@} Mahāgraha: She is included
among the afflictions ({%mahāgraha%} 3. 219. 41)
which are not favourable to children until
they are sixteen years old and are favourable
afterwards; a bird perches on her head and
eats the children with her 3. 219. 32, 41, 22.

<div n="P">The ascetic Mandapāla turned into a
Śārṅgaka bird had four sons from the Śārṅ-
gikā Jaritā; Mandapāla left them when they
were still in the eggs, but their mother did
not desert them; she reared them as birds
({%svavṛtyā%} 1. 220. 19) after they were born;
they all were seers ({%ṛṣi%}), knowers of Brah-
man, full of lustre and strong; they were able
speakers 1. 220. 17; 1. 224. 8, 10; 1. 225. 3;
when the fire began to burn the Khāṇḍava
forest Mandapāla praised Agni and secured
[Page079-b+ 40]

9; when the forest fire broke out the Śārṅgaka
young ones had not developed wings and feet
({%abarhāś caraṇair hīnāḥ%} 1. 221. 4, 18); as
the fire drew near they advised their mother
to abandon them and fly to a safe place;
she, on her part, advised them to creep into
the hole of a mouse to save themselves from
fire; they did not agree since they were
afraid of the mouse; when the young ones
were not prepared to enter the hole even
when assured by their mother that the mouse
was taken away by a falcon, she left them to
their fate 1. 221. 1-21; 1. 222. 1-16; as the
fire drew close the three younger Śārṅgaka
birds entreated the eldest one, Jarṅāri, to do
something to rescue them; on that occasion
Stambamitra said to his brother: “The eldest
is the protection, the eldest releases from
difficulty; if the eldest does not know (what
to do), what shall the younger one do ?”
(1. 223. 4); when the young Śārṅgaka birds
began to praise god fire in turns, Stamba-
mitra, when his turn arrived, said: “Oh
Agni, you are the only one, and this whole
world stands in you; you hold the beings
and you bear the world; you carry the ob-
lation, and wise men worship you as one and
as manifold; after creating these worlds,
you digest them when time arrives; you are
the source of this world and its mainstay;
oh lord of the world, you digest the food
eaten by the living beings” (1. 223. 12-15);
when the fire subsided the mother of the
Śarṅgaka birds returned to them 1. 224. 17;
sage Mandapāla also was anxious about the
safety of Stambamitra and the rest and he
[Page080-a+ 38]
returned to them; he was not greeted by the
children and they did not speak to him; he
enquired who was the eldest, who the next,
who the middle one and who the youngest;
when be assured them that he had already
secured their safety from god Fire they were
reconciled to him; Mandapāla left the region
of the Khāṇḍava forest and went elsewhere
with his wife and children 1. 224. 6, 20-22;

with Bhīma: When Bhīma was wandering on
the peaks of the Gandhamādana mountain in
search of heavenly lotus flowers having
heavenly fragrance, he made big noise with his
conch near the thicket of banana trees; hear-
ing it, the lions and the elephants roared; the
[Page081-a+ 40]
big noise aroused Hanūmant who was asleep
in the thicket; as he woke up, yawning, he
hit the ground with his large tail which looked
like the flag staff of Indra and produced
sound like a thunder; when Bhīma marched
forward to search the source of this sound
he saw Hanūmant lying on a thick stone-
slab in the midst of the banana trees 3. 146.
59-64; description of Hanūmant 3. 146. 65-
71; when Bhīma roared loudly Hanūmant
opened his eyes a little, looked despisingly
at Bhīma, and asked Bhīma why he woke
him up who was happily asleep; he told
Bhīma that as an intelligent human being
Bhīma should have shown compassion for
other beings; Bhīma therefore did not know
his {%dharma;%} Hanūmant then asked Bhīma
the purpose of his arriving at a place which
was not supposed to be visited by human
beings; the mountain, beyond that point, could
not be crossed unless one had acquired per-
fection ({%siddhagati%} 3. 146. 79); Hanūmant
advised Bhīma to eat the roots and fruits
to be found there which were as good as
{%amṛta%} and return 3. 146. 72-81; when Bhīma
introduced himself to Hanūmant as a Pāṇ-
ḍava and son of Vāyu, Hanūmant responded
with a smile but asked Bhīma to return rather
than proceed further and meet with danger;
when Bhīma insisted that he must proceed
and for that purpose Hanūmant should get
away from his path, Hanūmant replied that
it was not possible for him to move as he was
suffering from an ailment; if Bhīma must pro-
ceed he should cross over him; when Bhīma
said he was prepared to go beyond him and
the mountain as Hanūmant had crossed the
ocean, Hanūmant asked Bhīma who was that
Hanūmant, Bhīma replied that Hanūmant
was his brother, meritorious, brave and in-
[Page081-b+ 40]
telligent, famous in the Rāmāyaṇa; he crossed
the ocean to find out Rāma's wife; knowing
Bhīma to be arrogant due to the strength of
his arms, Hanūmant again told him that as he
could not move due to old age Bhīma should
set aside his tail from the path and proceed;
Bhīma failed in his attempt to lift the tail
and stood with his face turned down due to
shame; he bowed down to Hanūmant asking
for forgiveness; Bhīma requested Hanūmant
to reveal his identity and let him know whether
he was a {%siddha,%} a god, a Gandharva, or a
Guhyaka in the form of a monkey 3. 147.
17-22; Hanūmant then told Bhīma who he
really was and that he used to live with
Sugrīva on the Ṛśyamūka mountain since
the latter was cheated by his brother Vālin
3. 147. 27; Hanūmant further told Bhīma
that he had gone out with other crores of
monkeys in search of Sītā and was informed
by a vulture (Jaṭāyus) about Sītā; he had
then jumped over the ocean, one hundred
{%yojanas%} wide, seen Sītā in Rāvaṇa's house,
and returned after announcing himself to
Rāvaṇa; when Rāma finally started (for
Ayodhyā) Hanūmant had asked the following
boon from Rāma: “May I live as long as the
story of Rāma lasts”; the boon was granted
to him; Gandharvas and Apsarases sing the
narrative of Rāma ({%tasya vīrasya caritam%}
3. 147. 39) to please Hanūmant; Hanūmant
again told Bhīma that no mortal could go
beyond the point where they met since it was
frequented by the gods; Hanūmant informed
Bhīma that he had blocked Bhīma's way les the
should be attacked or cursed by some one, and
that the lake he was searching for was close
by 3. 147. 33-41; Bhīma then told Hanūmant
that he was highly blessed by his meeting with
Hanūmant; Bhīma requested him to show the
[Page082-a+ 40]
unrivalled form which he had assumed when he
leapt over the ocean; only then Bhīma would
believe what Hanūmant had told about him-
self; Hanūmant informed Bhīma that it was
not possible to assume forms of the bygone age;
one acquired the strength, form and prowess
according to the {%yuga%} in which one lived; he
had to follow the (rule of the) {%yuga,%} since no
one could go beyond Time ({%yuge yuge / bala-%}
{%varṣmaprabhāvā hi prahīyanty udbhavanti%}
{%ca … yugaṃ samanuvartāmi kālo hi dura-%}
{%tikramaḥ%} 3. 148. 7, 8); when Bhīma persisted
in his request, Hanūmant increased his body
immensely to look like mountain Maināka
and showed Bhīma the form he had assumed
to cross the ocean 3. 149. 2-4; description
of the body 3. 149. 4-7, 13; Hanūmant
told Bhīma that he could grow even more,
as much as he liked; Bhīma then requested
Hanūmant to assume his former shape 3.
149. 8-12 (Hanumant st. 8) when Bhīma
asked why Rāma himself had to go to Rā-
vaṇa when Hanūmant could destroy Laṅkā,
Hanūmant told him that if he had killed
Rāvaṇa, Rāma's fame would have suffered 3.
149. 14-20; Hanūmant then permitted Bhīma
to depart and showed him the way leading
to the Saugandhikavana and the garden of
Kubera; he warned Bhima not to pluck the
flowers himself and asked him to show regard
for the deities; he asked Bhīma not to act
rashly but follow the {%dharma%} 3. 149. 21-24;
Hanūmant then gave a long discourse on
{%dharma%} to Bhīma (explaining to him {%trayī,%}
{%vārtā%} and {%daṇḍanīti;%} the duties of the four
{%varṇas;%} the conduct of a king) 3. 149. 26-52;
Hanūmant contracted his body and embraced
Bhīma; the embrace removed Bhīma's fatigue;
with faltering voice and tears in his eyes
Hanūmant asked Bhīma to remember him and
[Page082-b+ 40]
not to tell anyone of his whereabouts; having
embraced a mortal (Bhīma) Hanūmant was
happy to be reminded of Rāma; Hanūmant
offered a boon to Bhīma: if Bhīma so wished
Hanūmant could go Hāstinapura and kill the
sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra or crush their town with
a rock 3. 150. 1-9; but Bhīma told Hanū-
mant that he (H.) had already done all that he
could do for Bhīma; instead of a boon he only
asked for Hanūmant's forgiveness and favour;
the Paṇḍavas had found in Hanūmant their
support which would help them to win the war;
hearing that Hanūmant told Bhīma that due to
brotherly feelings and friendliness ({%bhrātṛtvāt%}
{%sauhṛdāc cāpi%} 3. 150. 13), whenever Bhīma
roared in battles, Hanūmant would add his
roar to it and increase its volume; he would
stand on the flag-staff of Arjuna and roar
which would deprive the enemies of their
lives; hence Arjuna's banner often described
as marked by a monkey ({%vānara, kapi,%}
{%śākhāmṛga,%} but the monkey is not named
Hanūmant) 5. 47. 46; 5. 59. 13; 6. 56. 7,

so saying Hanūmant disappeared 3. 150.
14-15. {@F.@} Meeting with Rāma and the fight
between Vālin and Sugrīva: When Rāma
and Lakṣmaṇa arrived on top of the Ṛśya-
mūka mountain and saw five monkeys,
Hanūmant, as a messenger of Sugrīva,
approached them; Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa first
talked with Hanūmant and then approached
Sugrīva to form friendship with him 3. 264.
9-11; (later, in the fight between Vālin and
Sugrīva) when Rāma could not distinguish
between them, Hanūmant stuck a garland
[Page083-a+ 40]
round the neck of Sugrīva 3. 264. 33.
{@G.@} Search for Sītā: After the search for Sītā,
when Hanūmant and the other monkey-chiefs
were returning to the Ṛśyamūka mountain, on
way they rested in the {%madhuvana;%} Sugrīva
interpreted this behaviour ({%praṇaya%} 3. 266.
28) as indicating that Hanūmant and others
were successful in their mission; the monkey-
chiefs who had gone for the search then
approached Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa and Sugrīva
3. 266. 26-30; looking at the complexion of
Hanūmant and his gait Rāma understood
that he had seen Sītā; Hanūmant informed
Rāma that he had brought the good tidings;
he then described to Rāma his search for
Sītā in the south 3. 266. 31-55 (meeting the
female ascetic Prabhāvatī in the house of the
Daitya Maya; meeting with Saṃpāti and
obtaining from him the information that
Sītā must be with Ṛāvaṇa in Laṅkā and that
Laṅkā lay beyond the ocean); when no one
was prepared to cross the ocean, Hanūmant
did it after entering his father (i. e. Vāyu:
{%tataḥ pitaram āviśya pupluve 'haṃ māhār-%}
{%ṇavam%}) and killing on way an acquatic
Rākṣasī ({%jalarākṣasī%}) 3. 266. 57; in
Laṅkā, Hanūmant saw Sītā in the inner
apartment of Rāvaṇa ({%tatra sītā mayā%}
{%dṛṣṭā rāvaṇāntaḥpure satī%} 3. 266. 58);
having determined her identity Hanūmant
approached her and told her that he was the
son of god Wind and the messenger of Rāma;
he told Sītā that Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa were
safe and had enquired after Sītā's well-being;
he assured her that he was a monkey and
not a Rakṣasa, and that Rāma would soon
arrive in Laṅkā with his monkeys; Sītā told
him that she knew him already to be Hanū-
mant as was reported to her by the Rākṣasa
Avindhya; she gave Hanūmant a jewel and
[Page083-b+ 40]
permitted him to leave; to convince Rāma
that Hanūmant had met her, Sītā told him
the incident of Rāma throwing a reed at a
crow on the Citrakūṭa mountain; Hanūmant
then burnt Laṅkā and returned to Rāma
3. 266. 58-68. {@H.@} Encounter with indi-
vidual demons in Rāma's war with Rāvaṇa:
Hanūmant marched at the head of the army
when it started towards the sea in the south
3. 267. 16; when the demon Dhūmrākṣa
attacked the army of the monkeys, Hanū-
mant rushed towards him; this act inspired
confidence in the monkeys; the fight between
the two was fierce like the one between Indra
and Prahlāda; Dhūmrākṣa struck Hanūmant
with maces ({%gadā%}) and clubs ({%parigha%}),
and Hanūmant retaliated with trees; finally
Hanūmant killed Dhūmrākṣa together with
his horses, chariot and charioteer 3. 270. 7,
12-14; when Lakṣmaṇa was engaged in
fighting with the demons Vajravega and
and Pramāthin, Hanūmant attacked Vajra-
vega and killed him with the summit of a
mountain ({%adriśṛṅga%}) 3. 271. 24; Hanūmant
was among the monkey-chiefs who watched
over Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa when they fell
down on the ground tied with the arrows of
Indrajit 3. 273. 4; he was one of those who
applied water, sent by Kubera, to their eyes
which enabled them to see invisible beings 3.
273. 10-13; Hanūmant and other monkey-
chiefs surrounded Rāvaṇa when he rushed at
Rāma 3. 274. 3. {@I.@} Sītā's boon: At the
time of boon-givings after the war Sītā gave
Hanūmant the following boon: “You will
live as long as the fame of Rāma lasts ({%rāma-%}
{%kīrtyā samaṃ putra jīvitaṃ te bhavīṣyati%}),
and that the heavenly enjoyments will wait
on you” 3. 275. 43-44. {@J.@} Messenger to
Bharata: When Rāma approached the city
[Page084-a+ 38]
of Ayodhyā he sent Hanūmant to Bharata as
his messenger to give him the good news
(of Rāma's return); when Hanūmant, came
back, Rāma met Bharata at Nandigrāma 3.

he saw below his deadly enemy, the ichneumon
Harika, lying in the crevice of the earth;
the ichneumon came out quickly as he got
the scent of the mouse, looked up, and
licked his mouth for food 12. 136. 30-31;
[Page084-b+ 38]
(the mouse also noticed Candraka an owl,
his another enemy, up in the nest on the
branch of the tree 12. 136. 32); the mouse
thus faced danger from the ichneumon and
the owl at the same time; he realized that
Harika would catch him if he rushed to the
ground to save himself from the owl 12.
136. 33, 37; the mouse therefore decided to
take refuge with the cat, his third enemy,
who was trapped in the net; the mouse pointed
out to the cat the danger he was facing
owing to the evil intention of the ichneumon
and the owl; he offered to cut the threads of
the trap in which the cat was caught provided
the cat offered him protection from Harika
and Candraka 12. 136. 72-73; the cat agreed
and when Harika and Candraka saw the

<P>{@Kīṭa@} m.: A worm (not named).
<P>Sage Kṛṣṇadvaipāyana (Vyāsa) once,
while wandering, saw a worm ({%kīṭa%} 13. 118. 7)
running speedily away on a cart-road; the sage
asked the worm why he appeared so terrified,
what was the source of his fear, and where
he was going in haste; the worm replied that
he had heard the sound of a big cart, as
also the breathing of the bulls who were
drawing heavy burden, and sound of men; such
sounds could not be borne by worms; he was
running away from danger to his life; death
is painful and life is not easily obtained; when
the sage told the worm that he should be
happy to die since he was leading life in a
lower species ({%tiryagyoni%} 13. 118. 14) where
one did not understood sound, touch, taste,
smell and did not get diverse enjoyments, the
[Page086-b+ 40]
worm replied that a living being was attached
to whatever life he was in and hence he was
happy even in his present condition; as a
worm, he got the enjoyments his body needed;
men and animals have different enjoyments;
the worm told Vyāsa that in his former life
as a human being he was a wealthy Śūdra,
but he was not devoted to Brāhmaṇas; he
was cruel, living on usury, harsh in speech,
cunning in behaviour, plunderer of all; he
committed all sorts of cruel acts (13. 118.
19-24), remembering which he now repented;
but he had respected his mother and honoured
a good Brāhmaṇa with guest-worship; it was
on that account that he did not lose his
memory (of past birth); the worm felt that
due to that virtuous act he could hope for
happiness and asked Vyāsa what he was going
to be 13. 118. 7-28; Vyāsa told the worm
that it was due to his (Vyāsa's) favour
that the worm was not stupefied; sage Vyāsa
was able to save beings by merely looking
at them ({%ahaṃ hi darśanād eva tārayāmi%}
{%tapobalāt%} 13. 119. 2); Vyāsa knew that the
worm was reduced to that condition due to
his evil acts; but the worm would attain great
religious merit if he considered himself as
practising {%dharma%} ({%avāpsyasi paraṃ dhar-%}
{%maṃ dharmastho yadi manyase%} 13. 119. 3);
the worm would attain that state which an
excellent Brāhmaṇa ({%vipra%}) attained by
worshipping Sun and Moon and by telling
holy narratives; Vyāsa would lead the worm
to that state of {%brahma%} which was desired by
him; having got this assurance from Vyāsa
the worm (stopped running away and) stood
where he was; he went to see the sage when,
after death, having passed through various
births (13. 119. 9) he was born a Kṣatriya;
as a prince he fell at the feet of the sage
[Page087-a+ 40]
and described to him the comforts he enjoyed
in his present condition (13. 119. 12-15); he
acknowledged that it was due to the favour
of the sage that he, having once been a
worm, was now a prince; he asked Vyāsa
what next he should do; the sage told him
that his earlier sin was not destroyed; what-
ever good he had formerly done got him to
see the sage; that merit led him to the birth
of a Kṣatriya; now by offering his life on
the battle-field for the sake of cows and
Brāhmaṇas and by performing sacrifices
({%?ṛtūn%} 13. 119. 22) he could, having become
{%brahman (brahmabhū aḥ ?),%} obtain enjoy-
ments in heaven (13. 119. 1-23); the Kṣatriya
then began to practise severe austerities;
Vyāsa approached him and told him that as
a Kṣatriya his duty was to protect beings;
if he followed his {%dharma,%} he would become
a Brāhmaṇa; the Kṣatriya did as told and
after death became a Brāhmaṇa; Kṛṣṇa-
dvaipāyana came to him again and told him
not to be afflicted by anything; he would be
in danger if he neglected {%dharma;%} hence he
should practise the highest {%dharma%} ({%dharma-%}
{%lopād bhayaṃ te syāt tasmād dharmaṃ%}
{%carottamam%} 13. 120. 10); the worm again
acknowledged his debt to Vyāsa; he felt that
his sin was destroyed since he had obtained
prosperity rooted in {%dharma;%} the worm, who
was then a Brāhmaṇa, marked the earth by
the {%yūpas%} of sacrifices performed by him;
he then reached the world of Brahman and
obtained the eternal {%brahman%} by acting as
advised by Vyāsa 13. 120. 1-14; this incident
of the past ({%purāvṛtta%}) is reported in the

Gandharva Aṅgāraparṇa expressed his desire

exchange of the Gandharva horses ({%gandhar-%}

its use was known also to Kṛṣṇa (6. 116. 38;

4. 59. 21; irresistible even by the gods ({%devair%}
{%api sudurdharṣam%}) 7. 172. 14. {@C.@} Its
use in war and its effects: 1. In the epic
war: (i) when used by Karṇa against
Arjuna, it gave to Karṇa's bow a fiery
look and it released fiery arrows; Arjuna
apparently combated it with the same kind of
{%astra (astraṃ astreṇa saṃvārya%}) 7. 31. 51-
52; (ii) used by Droṇa against Yuyudhāna
(Sātyaki); this was combated by Sātyaki
with Vāruṇāstra 7. 73. 46; (iii) Bhāradvāja
(Droṇa) used Āgneya and other heavenly
missiles against Yudhiṣṭhira which were ren-
dered ineffective by Yudhiṣṭhira 7. 132. 29-30;
(iv) Aśvatthāman used it against Arjuna;
when released, it produced a shower of
arrows ({%śaravarṣam ajāyata%} 7. 172. 16;
{%śaravṛṣṭayaḥ%} 7. 172. 22); cold winds blew, sun
lost its lustre, clouds rained blood, all beings
became restless; the arrows were fiery and
produced good deal of heat; they burnt down
enemies, elephants, horses and chariots; the
god Fire burnt the army like the Saṃvartaka
fire at the end of the aeon 7. 172. 16-27; the
whole army, including Arjuna, could not be
seen due to the darkness; the like of the {%astra%}
released by Aśvatthāman was never seen
before by Saṃjaya and his colleagues 7. 172.
30-31; Arjuna combated it with Brāhma Astra
7. 172. 14, 32; it was meant to be used by
Arjuna in the war 5. 140. 6 (here referred to
as Āgni instead of Āgneya). 2. Outside
the epic war: (i) Arjuna used it against
Gandharva Aṅgāraparṇa; when released, it
[Page092-a+ 39]
burnt down the excellent chariot of Aṅgāra-
parṇa, and he fell down, head downwards, as
he swooned due to the lustre of the missile 1.
158. 28, 29, 37; (ii) used by Droṇa (besides
using other divine missiles) against Arjuna at
the time of the cattle-raid; Arjuna combated
it with his Āgneyāstra 4. 53. 48; (iii) on the
same occasion used by Bhīṣma and Arjuna
against each other to combat each other's
missiles 4. 59. 21; (iv) in his fight with
Citrasena and the Gandharvas Arjuna killed
thousands of Gandharvas with Āgneyāstra
3. 234. 7; when released once again, the
Gandharvas, afflicted by heat, were dejected
3. 234. 17; (v) at the time of displaying
his skill in the use of missiles, Arjuna
produced fire by releasing Āgneyāstra 1. 125.
19; (vi) employed by Bhīṣma against
Rāma (Jāmadagnya); it was rendered in-
effective by the counter-use of Vāruṇāstra
5. 181. 12. {@D.@} Mode of use: The normal
arrows were supposed to be infused by this
{%astra%} ({%astre te vāruṇāgneye tābhyāṃ%}
{%bāṇasamāhite%} 7. 73. 48) by reciting {%mantras%}
over it ({%anumantrya%} 5. 181. 12, {%abhimantrya%}
7. 172. 15); Aśvatthāman also sipped water
({%vāry upaspṛśya%} 7. 172. 14) before reciting

Bhīṣma, Duryodhana, Bhūriśravas and Śalya,
he put to use the Māhendra astra by
forcefully drawing the Gāṇḍīva bow 6.

rounded by thousands of kings ({%rājasa-%}
{%hasrāṇi%} 6. 77. 32) and his normal arrows
were not enough to ward off their arrows,
[Page095-a+ 40]
Arjuna brought forth his Aindra astra and
successfully repelled the arrows of the
enemies 6. 77. 40-41; (iii) when Arjuna
was attacked by Śrutāyus and Acyutāyus
who showered arrows on the right and left of
Arjuna and attacked him with {%tomara%} and
{%śūla%} respectively, Arjuna manifested Śākra
astra to take care of the weapons of the
enemies and kill both of them 7. 68. 7-13,
21; (iii) when attacked by the Saṃśaptakas
all together, Arjuna manifested Aindra astra
to cut down all sorts of weapons of the
enemies as also to cut off their limbs and
chariots 8. 19. 22-29; (iv) when Arjuna
was severely struck on his chest by Suśar-
man, he produced Aindra astra 8. 37. 30-31;
(v) used by Arjuna to combat Karṇa's
Brahmāstra 8. 66. 48-50; (vi) used by
Arjuna to combat the Aindra astra used by
Droṇa 7. 163. 28; (vii) used, together with
Vāyavya, by Droṇa against Yudhiṣṭhira; the
latter combated both of them with Māhendra
astra 7. 132. 31, 32; (viii) used by Sātyaki
to fight with the demon Alambusa; it reduced
to ashes the {%māyā%} employed by the demon
6. 78. 40; (2) Outside the epic war:
(i) During the cattle raid, when Arjuna
was attacked by Kṛpa, Karṇa and Droṇa with
heavenly missiles, Arjuna released the Aindra
astra; he covered the enemies with arrows as
the sun would do with his rays 4. 58. 8-9;
(ii) when Arjuna was attacked by the
Nīvātakavacas with showers of huge rocks,
Arjuna released it (Indrāstra) and the {%vajra-%}
like arrows released by the missile, pounded
the rocks hurled by the enemies to pieces by

Arjuna's bow (Gāṇḍiva recognized by
Kāśikā on P. 5. 2. 110, but very likely it

{@A.@} Etymology: So called because it
was made of {%gāṇḍī,%} i. e. the bow was
covered with the skin of rhinoceros (?), or
[Page098-a+ 41]
because it was made of the backbone of rhin-
oceros (?) ({%eṣa gāṇḍīmayaś cāpaḥ … yatas%}

was created by Brahman in very old times
({%purā%}) 1. 216. 17; 8. 50. 56; Indra fastened
an undecaying ({%ajarā%}) string on it when
Arjuna got ready to fight the Nivātakavacas
3. 165. 14; (however, Aśvatthāman cut it
off and Arjuna had to put a new string on
it 4. 54. 8). {@C.@} History: After its
creation, Brahman first held it for 1000
years, and then it was held successively by
Prajāpati for 800 years (?) or 503 years (?)
({%trīṇi pañcaśataṃ caiva%}), by Śakra for 85
years, by Soma for 500 years, by Varuṇa
for 100 years, and, up to the beginning
of the {%ajñātavāsa,%} it was with Arjuna for
65 years 4. 38. 39-41; it lay in the Varuṇa-
loka, perhaps in Varuṇa's lake, and was
guarded there by the gods 5. 96. 19; hence the
how was considered as properly belonging to
Varuṇa ({%vāruṇaṃ gāṇḍivam%}) 5. 155. 5;
(5. 59. 12); at the time of burning the
Khāṇḍava forest, Agni asked Varuṇa to give
Gāṇḍīva, which he had received from Soma,
to Arjuna since he was to perform great feats
with it; Varuṇa agreed to Agni's request 1.
216. 3-4; (17. 1. 39); when Arjuna received
it, he bowed to Agni, held the bow firmly, and
strung it; at that time there was a loud noise
1. 216. 17-20; 1. 55. 37; 3. 157. 20; 5. 155. 7;
according to another version Arjuna received
the bow, not before, but after he satisfied
god Fire 2. 44. 5; 8. 57. 41; Śaṅkara told
[Page098-b+ 41]
Arjuna that the Ganḍīva he now held was the

the Daityas at the time of Indra's {%abhiṣeka%}

(2) Karṇa inferred that Arjuna must have
killed the Śibis and the Pauravas 7. 145. 45-

be nearby 7. 95. 9; (4) it became a rally-

of his bow ({%gāṇḍīvaṃ prākṣipat pāṛthaḥ%})

1. Besides Arjuna, the bow (Gāṇḍiva)
could be strung only by Bhīma and Kṛṣṇa
3. 13. 69; but it was, in fact, used only by
Arjuna, hence blame could attach to
Gāṇḍiva of Arjuna if it was not used against
Duryodhana 3. 13. 70; 4. 20. 1; Arjuna's
association with Gāṇḍīva and dependence of
Pāṇḍavas' victory on it often stressed 1. 216

5. 124. 2; 8. 69. 24; Arjuna owed a debt to
his bow from which he would be free by
killing Karṇa 8. 52. 23; Arjuna could wield
the bow with both hands equally dexterously
({%ubhau me dakṣiṇau pāṇī gāṇḍīvasya%}

4. 39. 17; 4. 56. 4; 4. 59. 12; 7. 51. 40;

no one realized the time that elapsed
between Arjuna's drawing out the arrow
from the quiver, his putting it to the
bow, and discharging it from Gāṇḍīva 4.

Arjuna must have used Gāṇḍīva on all
occasions (5. 53. 1) starting from its use
when Arjuna helped god Fire to burn the
Khāṇḍava forest (1. 217-219); the bow is
specifically mentioned by name when Arjuna
got ready to fight with Kirmīra 3. 12. 40;
started off to meat Indra to acquire heavenly
weapons 3. 38. 15; lifted it to shoot at the
boar (Daitya Mūka) 3. 40. 9; fought with
Kirāta (Śaṅkara) 3. 40. 29; in this fight
the bow (not named) was swallowed by
[Page102-a+ 40]
Śaṅkara 3. 40. 39-40, and then returned to
Arjuna 3. 41. 4, 25; used while fighting

Kṛpa 4. 52. 3, 8; with Droṇa 4. 53. 28, 58;
at the start of the epic war Arjuna raised his
bow (Gāṇḍīva not named) while asking
Kṛṣṇa to station his chariot between the two
armies 6. 23. 20; out of dejection Gāṇḍīva
slipped down from Arjuna's hand 6. 23. 30;
but afterwards he used it successfully in the
war 6. 41. 1; he used it to attack Bhīṣma
6. 43. 9; 6. 81. 10; to fight with Suda-
kṣiṇa (a Kāmboja prince) 7. 67. 61; its use
against Jayadratha hinted 3. 252. 17, 18;
while forcing his way towards Jayadratha
1. 1. 137; Arjuna, with Gāṇḍīva in hand,
stood guard on the ground when, while mar-

and when Vajradatta's elephant attacked
Arjuna 14. 75. 10; at the end of the epic
war when the Pāṇḍavas reached the camp of
Duryodhana Kṛṣṇa asked Arjuna to unstring
the Gāṇḍīva 9. 61. 9; he used it while
fighting with Babhruvāhana 14. 78. 27;

countries 14. 83. 29-30; to fight with the
Dasyus 16. 8. 52, 58. {@H.@} Arjuna's
vow regarding Gāṇḍīva: It was Arjuna's
secret vow ({%upāṃśuvrata, vrata%}) to kill a
person who asked him to give away his
Gāṇḍīva to some one else 8. 49. 9, 61-62;
({%pratijñā%}) 8. 49. 11, 63; but the vow was
apparently known to Kṛṣṇa (8. 49. 61) and
to Yudhiṣṭhira 8. 49. 107-109 ({%pratijñā%});
Yudhiṣṭhira, in a fit of anger, asked Arjuna
to give away Gāṇḍīva to Kṛṣṇa and act as
his charioteer, and hence Yudhiṣṭhira's life
was in danger 8. 48. 14; 8. 49. 1. {@I.@} Com-
parisons: 1 (i) Arjuna with the stretched
Gāṇḍīva forming a full circle appeared like the
sun with a halo around it ({%yathaiva sūryaḥ%}
{%pariveṣagas tathā%}) 8. 57. 57; (ii) when
Arjuna released arrows using both hands,
Gāṇḍīva looked like a swinging wheel of
fire ({%agnicakram ivābaddham%}) 4. 59. 12;
(iii) in the sacrifice to be performed with
weapons ({%śastrayajña%}), Gānḍīva would serve
as a sacrificial ladle ({%sruc%}) 5. 139. 30;
2. Standard of comparison: (i) The
lustre of Rukmin's bow (Vijaya), obtained
from Mahendra, compared with that of
Gāṇḍīva 5. 155. 4; (ii) the sound ({%ghoṣa%})
of Abhimanyu's bow compared with that of
Gāṇḍīva 6. 45. 16 {@J.@} Defeat: 1. Occa-
sional: (i) When Arjuna's arrows had no
effect on the armour of Duryodhana, Kṛṣṇa
asked Arjuna whether his Gāṇḍīva had lost
its former force ({%prāṇāḥ%}) 7. 78. 7; (ii)
Jayadratha on one occasion succeeded in
piercing the Gāṇḍīva with three arrows
7. 121. 12; (iii) as long as Karṇa had his
armour, ear-rings, and the {%śakti,%} Arjuna, even
with his Gāṇḍīva, could not defeat Karṇa
7. 155. 17; 7. 155. 13-15; (iv) when
[Page103-a+ 39]
Aśvatthaman excelled Arjuna, Krṣṇa in
surprise asked him whether he still held the
Gāṇḍīva in his hand 8. 40. 124; (v) Gāṇ-
ḍīva dropped down from the hand of Arjuna
when Dhṛtavarman of the Trigartas hit
Arjuna on his hand with a sharp arrow
14. 73. 22-24 (picked up by Arjuna 14. 75.
24); (vi) when the Sindhu kings attacked
Arjuna and he swooned, Gāṇḍīva slipped
from his hand 14. 76. 21, (which he picked
up again 14. 76. 26); (vii) According to
Ulūka, Gāṇḍīva of no help to Arjuna at
the game of dice 5. 158. 28-29; 2. Final:
When Arjuna was taking with him the
Vṛṣṇi women to Hāstinapura, he was attacked
on way by the Dasyus; at that time Arjuna
could string the Gāṇḍīva with great effort
({%yatnād iva kathaṃcana; kṛcchreṇa%}) 16.
8. 52-53; his arrows were exhausted so
that Arjuna had to strike the Dasyus with
the tip of the bow ({%dhanuṣkoṭyā%}) 16. 8.
58-60, 63 ({%dhanuṣaś cāvidheyatvāt%}); 16.
9. 17-18; this was the defeat of Gāṇḍīva
({%gāṇḍīvasya parābhavam%}) 1. 2. 226. {@K.@}
Returned to Varuṇa: When the Pāṇḍavas
started for the forest, Arjuna would not
leave his bow and quivers behind; Agni, who
had burnt the Khāṇḍava, asked Arjuna
to abandon the bow as it had no further
purpose to serve; Agni got it from Varuṇa
for Arjuna, hence Arjuna should return it
to Varuṇa; at the instance of his brothers,
Arjuna dropped the bow and the quivers into
the water 17. 1. 32, 36-37, 39-40.

circumspection: The missile was not to be
employed in haste ({%na tv idaṃ sahasā%}
{%brahman prayoktavyaṃ kathaṃcana%}); since
[Page110-a+ 40]
it did not return without killing the enemy,
it might kill, if used without circumspection,
even one who did not deserve to be killed
7. 166. 46-47; (2) Mode of release: To use
it, Aśvatthāman touched water and produced
the divine missile ({%tathoktvā droṇaputro 'pi%}
{%tadopaspṛśya bhārata / prāduścakāra tad%}
{%divyam astraṃ nārāyaṇaṃ tadā%}) 7. 166. 60;
(3) Restrictions: It could be used only
once, and it could not be withdrawn; hence
Aśvatthāman unable to employ it again when
requested by Duryodhana to do so; if with-
drawn the {%astra%} would kill the user 7. 171.
24, 27, 28, 30. {@D.@} Effects: When em-
ployed, the missile released powerful arrows
({%? kṛśāśvatanayāḥ%}), as also sharp arrows
which would fill the directions 7. 166. 38;
it let loose many heavenly weapons ({%divyāni%}
{%śastravarṣāṇi%}) and the employer (Aśvat-
thāman) shone with lustre 7. 166. 50; the
arrows released from it would hit the enemies
as desired by the employer (Aśvatthāman);
it would release rocks at will and iron-tipped
arrows which would put the enemy to flight
7. 166. 53-54; when Aśvatthāman produced
the missile, thunderous winds carrying water-
drops blew in cloud-less sky, the earth shook,
and the ocean was agitated; rivers started
flowing in the opposite direction; peaks of
mountains were shattered; sun became turbid
({%kaluṣa%}), and the gods, the demons, and
the Gandharvas were frightened 7. 167. 1-5;
arrows with shining tips appeared in thou-
sands to cover the army of the enemy and
fill the directions; (hot) iron balls ({%kārṣṇāya-%}
{%samayā guḍāḥ%}) shining like celestial bodies,
{%śataghnīs%} (‘hundred-killers’), fire-arms
({%? hutāśadāḥ%}), and disks with sharp ends
({%cakrāṇi kṣurāntāni%}), all these were produc-
ed by the Nārāyaṇāstra (7. 170. 16-19); as the
[Page110-b+ 40]
Pāṇḍava warriors tried to resist the missile,
it grew in strength 7. 170. 21; as a result,
the Pāṇḍava army was burnt and destroyed
7. 170. 22-23; to combat it successfully
Kṛṣṇa advised the warriors to lay down arms
and get down from their chariots and mounts
7. 170. 38-42; when all followed his in-
struction, Bhīma wanted to resist the missile
with arrows, mace, and the strength of his
arms; as a consequence, the Nārāyaṇāstra
grew in strength; since other warriors
had laid down their arms the missile des-
cended on Bhīma with all its strength 7.
170. 45-46, 50-51, 57-60; seeing Bhīma
surrounded by the Nārāyaṇāstra, Arjuna tried
to protect him from the missile by using
Vāruṇāstra; since this was of no avail,
Arjuna and Vāsudeva left from their chariot,
ran to Bhīma, and entered through the cover
of lustre produced by the {%astra;%} since they
had no weapons, the {%astra%} did not affect them
(and also because of the effect of the Vāru-
ṇāstra and the prowess of Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna);
Bhīma was forced down by Nara (Arjuna)
and Nārāyaṇa (Kṛṣṇa) from his chariot and
forced to give up weapons; the Nārāyaṇāstra
was then pacified; the quarters became clear
and gentle winds blew; the birds and the
animals felt assured 7. 171. 1, 3, 6, 10-14,
20-22; if Vāsudeva had not shown the way
to combat the Nārāyaṇāstra it would have
meant death for the enemy (of the Kauravas)
7. 171. 28; but the missile was rendered in-
effective and the Pāṇḍavas freed from it 7.
171. 33; 8. 1. 42. {@E.@} The means to pacify
the Nārāyaṇāstra: When released, the missile
must kill the enemy and only then it would
subside; the other ways of pacifying it were to
run away from it, to lay down the arms, to
beg for life, and ask refuge ({%vadhaḥ saṃkhye%}

Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna 5. 149. 64-65; (ii) when
the two armies were arrayed against each
other, ready to fight, Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna blew
their conches 6. 1. 17; 6. 23. 15; (iii) Kṛṣṇa
blew his Pāñcajanya at the start of the
second day's war 6. 47. 25 (and presumably
[Page113-a+ 40]
at the start of the war on all subsequent
days); (iv) when Arjuna vowed to fight
more seriously with Bhīṣma 6. 55. 102;
(v) when Arjuna rushed at Bhīṣma who was
fighting with other Pāṇḍavas 6. 67. 2;
(vi) Kṛṣṇa blew his conch when Arjuna
took the vow to kill Jayadratha 7. 51. 41;
(vii) at the start of the day on which Jaya-
dratha was killed 7. 64. 20; when Arjuna was
heading forward looking for Jayadratha in
the Kaurava army 7. 75. 31; as Arjuna was
nearing Jayadratha 7. 78. 37; 7. 79. 11; at
the end of the day when Jayadratha was killed
7. 123. 41; [It is significant that the sounding
of Pāñcajanya is mentioned on many occa-
sions on the day on which Arjuna had to
fulfil his difficult vow to kill Jayadratha];
(viii) Kṛṣṇa blew it when Arjuna got rid
of the Saṃśaptakas who had overwhelmed
both of them 8. 37. 19, 15-17; (ix) at the
death of Karṇa and the subsequent rout of
the Kaurava army 8. 68. 57; (x) at the fall
of Duryodhana 9. 60. 65; (2) Outside the
epic war: Kṛṣṇa blew it to challenge Śālva
when he reached Śālva's Saubhapura 3. 15.
20; when Kṛṣṇa started fighting with Śālva
3. 21. 12; when, during his fight with Śālva,
Kṛṣṇa killed many Dānavas 3. 21. 29-30;
{@G.@} Its use as a signal: (1) Kṛṣṇa had told
Dāruka, his charioteer, that when he heard
the sound of Pāñcajanya he was to rush to
the battle-field driving Kṛṣṇa's chariot for its
eventual use by Kṛṣṇa to enable Arjuna to
fulfil his vow to kill Jayadratha 7. 56. 36;
(2) The sound was once interpreted by
Droṇa to mean that Arjuna wanted to set
aside other heroes and attack Bhīṣma 6. 108.
14; (3) It was once interpreted by
Yudhiṣṭhira to mean that Arjuna was in
danger 7. 85. 35; on another occasion, the
[Page113-b+ 37]
sound meant for Yudhiṣṭhira the death of
Arjuna, and hence Kṛṣṇa's starting to fight
7. 102. 32-33. {@H.@} End: When the time
of the destruction of the Vṛṣṇis and the
Andhakas arrived the blowing of Pāñca-
janya in their houses was accompanied by
the harsh braying of the asses 16. 3. 15

(8. 24. 4, 10-12); 13. 14. 128. {@C.@} Śiva
[Page115-a+ 40]
gave it to (1) Arjuna: Two accounts:
(i) Arjuna desired to have Śiva's Pāśupata
missile so that he could burn the Dānavas,
the Rākṣasas, the Bhūtas, the Piśācas, the
Gandharvas and the mythical serpents
({%pannagas%}) in battle; he could then be a
match for Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Kṛpa, and Karṇa
3. 41. 7, 9, 11; Arjuna called it Brahma-
śiras which was terrific and of fierce power
({%yat tad brahmaśiro nāma raudraṃ bhīma-%}
{%parākramam%}) 3. 41. 8; Śiva ready to give
Pāśupata, his dear weapon ({%dayitam astram%}),
to Arjuna as he was capable of possessing
({%dhāraṇa%}), releasing ({%mokṣa%}), and with-
drawing ({%saṃhāra%}) it 3. 41. 13; to receive
it, Arjuna purified himself and remained fully
attentive ({%śucir bhūtvā samāhitaḥ%}); he
folded his hands and said to Śiva ‘recite (the
mantra)’ ({%adhīṣva%}); Śiva then taught it
to Arjuna together with its secrets and mode
of withdrawal ({%sarahasyanivartanam%}) 3. 41.
17-18; the missile, like the God of Death in
bodily form, then waited on Arjuna; at that
time the earth trembled and there was a loud
sound of conches, drums and {%bheris%} by thou-
sands; the gods and demons saw the missile
in bodily form standing near Arjuna 3. 41.
17-22; 1. 1. 109; 3. 163. 48, 51; 6. 116. 38;
8. 57. 44; (ii) During the night, after Arjuna
took the vow to kill Jayadratha the next
day before sunset, Kṛṣṇa advised Arjuna to
acquire the knowledge of the great Pāśupata
missile from Śiva in order to be able to
accomplish his vow; Kṛṣṇa advised Arjuna
to mentally approach god Śiva; Arjuna
touched water ({%saṃspṛśyāmbhaḥ%}), sat down
on the ground, and mentally went to Bhava
(Śiva) 7. 57. 17-19; Arjuna praised Śiva and
made him favourable to give the missile 7.
57. 59; Śiva told Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa that
[Page115-b+ 40]
nearby there was a lake of nectar where he
had left his divine bow and arrow; he asked
them to get his bow and arrow 7. 57. 64-
65; when they brought the bow and arrow,
a Brahmacārin came from the side of Śiva; he
held the bow and, putting the arrow on it,
drew it according the prescriptions ({%vyakarṣac%}
{%cāpi vidhivat saśaraṃ dhanur uttamam%} 7.
57. 75); having seen how the Brahmacārin
held the bow in his grip, how he drew the
string, and the posture adopted by him
({%tasya maurvīṃ ca muṣṭiṃ ca sthānaṃ%}
{%cālakṣya pāṇḍavaḥ%} 7. 57. 76), and having
heard the {%mantra%} recited by Śiva, Arjuna
understood the way how to employ Pāśupata;
the arrow was shot by the Brahmacārin in
the lake and the bow was again placed in
it; Arjuna then remembered the boon Śiva
granted to him during his stay in the forest
({%āraṇyaka%}) and his meeting Śiva, and wished
that he might now receive the boon; knowing
Ariuna's mind, Śiva gave him the boon, the
Pāśupata missile, and wished him success in
accomplishing his vow; Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna
bowed down to Śiva and, when permitted to
leave, delighted they returned to their camp,
7. 57. 73-81; (Śiva gave missile to Arjuna
7. 173. 100); (2) Besides Arjuna, Kṛṣṇa
knew the use of Pāśupata 7. 57. 79; 8.
57. 44; Bhīṣma is not so sure about Kṛṣṇa's
knowledge of the Pāśupata 6. 116. 39.
{@D.@} Effects: The missile, when released,
produced thousands of tridents ({%śūlas%}),
fierce maces ({%gadāś cograpradarśanāḥ%}),
and charmed arrows having the form of
serpents ({%śarāś cāśīviṣākārāḥ saṃbhavanty%}
{%anumantritāḥ%}) 3. 41. 10. {@E.@} Restrictions
on its use: Arjuna was specifically told by
Śiva that the missile was never to be used
against men ({%na prayojyaṃ bhaved etan%}
[Page116-a+ 40]
{%mānuṣeṣu kathaṃcana%}); Arjuna was to
use the missile only if he was under
severe pressure ({%pīḍyamānena balavat%}),
or if he wished to ward off the missiles
used by his opponents ({%astrāṇāṃ prati-%}
{%ghāte ca sarvathaiva prayojayeḥ%}) 3. 163.
49-50; 3. 41. 15; if used against ordinary
persons it would burn the entire world
3. 41. 15. {@F.@} Use in the epic war:
(1) Arjuna in his message to the Kauravas,
sent through Saṃjaya, threatened that he
would use the Pāśupata missile against them in
the war 5. 47. 100; Kṛṣṇa told Karṇa that in
the ‘sacrifice to be performed with the wea-
pons’ ({%śastrayajña%} 5. 139. 29), the {%mantras%}
recited by Arjuna while releasing the Pāśupata
and other missiles would serve as the {%mantras%}
used while performing a sacrifice 5. 139. 31;
(2) Droṇa used Pāśupata against Arjuna
and it was repelled ({%jaghāna%}) by Arjuna
presumably by using the same missile 7.
163. 28; (3) Karṇa used it against Yudhi-
ṣṭhira and hence Kṛṣṇa apprehended Yudhi-
ṣṭhira's death in the war 8. 43. 21, 18.
{@G.@} Status: The Pāśupata missile surpassed
all other missiles like Brāhma, Nārāyaṇa,
Aindra, Āgneya, and Vāruṇa; it could
destroy all weapons ({%sarvaśastravighātana%})
13. 14. 127; even gods like Indra, Yama,
Kubera, Varuṇa, and Vāyu did not know it
3. 41. 14; there was none who could not be
killed by it; besides its use on an arrow,
it could be released even by mind, eye, and
speech ({%manasā cakṣuṣā vācā dhanuṣā ca%}

(once called {%brahmāstra%} 10. 15. 21).
{@A.@} History: Supposed to have arisen
from Brahman's lustre ({%brahmatejobhava%}
10. 15. 7); Droṇa, after practising severe
austerities, received the missile Brahmaśiras
from Agastya 10. 12. 14; later it was taught

[Page120-b+ 40]
({%devagandharvapūjita%}) 10. 12. 14; capable of
burning the whole earth ({%dahed yad pṛthivīm%}
{%api%}) 10. 12. 4. {@C.@} Restrictions on its
use: (1) while giving the {%astra%} to Arjuna,
Droṇa told him not to use it against men, but
to use it only if he was attacked in a battle
by a superhuman enemy ({%amānuṣaḥ śatruḥ%});
if released against an enemy of lesser mettle
({%alpatejas%}), the missile would burn the
world 1. 123. 75, 77; (2) while teaching it
to Aśvatthāman, who was known to be rash
by nature, Droṇa warned him not to use it
even under dire circumstances in battle, espe-
cially not against men ({%paramāpadgatenāpi%}
{%na sma tāta tvayā raṇe / idam astraṃ%}
{%prayoktavyaṃ mānuṣeṣu viśeṣataḥ%}) 10. 12.
7-8. {@D.@} Taught by Droṇa only to Arjuna
and Aśvatthāman: (1) It was given to
Arjuna since Droṇa considered him to be dis-
tinguished among his pupils ({%viśiṣṭaṃ sarva-%}
{%śiṣyebhyaḥ%}) 1. 123. 72; 10. 15. 21; when
taught to Arjuna, he would be an unrivalled

{%dhanurdharaḥ%}) 1. 123. 78; Droṇa taught
to Arjuna, both its use and withdrawal
({%saprayoganivartanam%}) 1. 123. 74; its with-
drawal very difficult; once released, no one
except Arjuna, not even Indra, was capable of
withdrawing it 10. 15. 5, 6; it could not be with-
drawn by one who had not observed celibacy;
if a non-qualified person tried to withdraw
it, it would cut his head and destroy his
belongings 10. 15. 7-8; Arjuna could with-
draw it as he was truthful, brave, had prac-
tised celibacy, and was obedient to his teacher
10. 15. 10, 20, 24; although fully qualified
to withdraw it, Arjuna never used it in the
epic war nor outside it, even under stress

Envious of Arjuna, Aśvatthāman asked his
father to teach him Brahmaśiras; Droṇa gave
it to him but not with a pleased mind ({%nāti-%}
{%hṛṣṭamanā iva%}) 10. 12. 6; (since Aśvatthā-
man could not make use of it) he wanted to
exchange it with Kṛṣṇa for his (Sudarśana)
Cakra so that Aśvatthāman could be invin-
cible 10. 12. 15, 36; Kṛṣṇa offered to give
any one of his weapons to Aśvatthāman with-
out receiving from him in return his Brahma-
śiras 10. 12. 18-19; Aśvatthāman chose
the Cakra but failed even so much as to move
it from its place 10. 12. 20-23. {@E.@} Use:
As Aśvatthāman was cruel and rash, there
was every danger of his using Brahmaśiras
against Bhīma, who was chasing him 10. 12.
40; when Aśvatthāman actually used it on an
{%iṣīkā,%} Kṛṣṇa advised Arjuna to release his
Brahmaśiras to counter it; Arjuna got down
from the chariot with bow and arrow in
hand, wished ‘well’ ({%svasti%} 10. 14. 5; 1. 1.
155) first to Aśvatthāman, then to himself
and to his brothers (the Pāṇḍavas); then
bowing down to deities and teachers, he
released Brahmaśiras, wishing welfare, and
saying ‘may the missile pacify (Aśvatthā-
man's) missile’ ({%utsasarja śivaṃ dhyāyann%}
{%astram astreṇa śāmyatām%}) 10. 14. 4-6; 10.
15. 2, 20; 1. 1. 155; at that time fire broke
out like the fire at the end of the aeon; the fire
of Arjuna's missile matched the fire of Aśvat-
thāman's missile; as a result terror struck the
creatures, skies were filled with great sound
and were engulfed in fire, earth, with its
mountains and trees, shook; the two missiles
produced heat with their lustre 10. 14. 7-11;
just then Nārada and Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana, de-
[Page121-b+ 40]
siring welfare for all the people, appeared and
stood between the two missiles; they pointed
out that Brahmaśiras was never used by any
one before against men 10. 14. 16; in response
to their appeal, Arjuna immediately with-
drew his Brahmaśiras; but Aśvatthāman could
not 10. 15. 1-15; moreover, if Brahmaśiras
was pacified by the other powerful missile
({%paramāstra%}) there would be no rain in the
land for twelve years 10. 15. 23; Aśvatthā-
man then directed his missile towards the
foetus of the Pāṇḍavas 10. 15. 31, 32; 10.

Droṇa not equalled by any one in the use

181. 20; 6. 116. 38; in its use, he never
violated the rules of the Kṣatriyas ({%kṣatra-%}

him Brahmāstra together with its secret and
withdrawal, but Droṇa refused to oblige
12. 2. 10, 13; Karṇa, who coveted the Astra
(12. 3. 27, 30), then learnt it in its entirety
({%kṛtsnam%}) from Rāma Jāmadagnya 12. 3.
2; 8. 5. 67; but since Karṇa had told a lie
to obtain its knowledge (12. 3. 30), Rāma
cursed him saying that the missile would flash
to him on all occasions except when he met
his equal and the time of his death had arrived

to Duryodhana that he had acquired the
missiles (from Rāma) ({%kṛtāstro 'smi%}) 12. 3.
33; since Karṇa had pacified Rāma, knowledge
of Brahmāstra remained with him; hence
Karṇa assured Duryodhana that he was quite
capable of bearing the burden of the war

Karṇa boasted to Śalya that he knew the
Brāhma astras (pl. {%astrāṇi … brāhmāṇī%}) 8.

perhaps Kṛṣṇa knew Brāhma and many
other heavenly weapons ({%kṛṣṇo vā devakī-%}

taught it to Karṇa after performing due rites
({%tasmai sa vidhivat kṛtsnam brahmāstraṃ%}
{%sanivartanam / provāca%}) 12. 3. 2; Droṇa
learnt from Rāma Jāmadagnya both—the
mode of its employment ({%prayoga%}) and with-
drawal ({%saṃhāra%}) 1. 154. 11; when Karṇa
expressed his desire to learn it from Droṇa
he wanted to know it with its secrets and the
mode of its withdrawal ({%sarahasyanivartanam%})
12. 2. 10; Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Kṛpa, Karṇa and
Aśvatthāman reputed for their knowledge of
the employment of the {%astra%} and its remedy
(i. e. withdrawal) ({%saprayogacikitsitam%}) 3.
38. 5; it could be taught only to a Brāh-
maṇa who had duly observed the prescribed
vow ({%yathāvat caritavrataḥ%}), or a Kṣatriya
who had practised austerities ({%tapasvī%}), but
to none else 12. 2. 13; hence Karṇa told a
[Page123-b+ 40]
lie to Rāma Jāmadagnya about his lineage
while declaring that he was a Bhārgava Brāh-
maṇa 12. 2. 15; 12. 3. 26-30. {@E.@} Use

used it to kill the Pauloma and the Kālakeya
demons; Arjuna first used all his other missiles

was himself oppressed by them; at that time he
was afraid; he bowed to Rudra and employed
the great Raudra missile on his arrow ({%mahā-%}

accounts: (1) when the Kāleya demons, under
the leadership of Vṛtra, attacked Indra and the
other gods, Brahman advised them to approach
the sage Dadhīca and ask him for his bones in
order to fashion a Vajra out of it; with that
Vajra, Indra was to kill Vṛtra 3. 98. 3-11;
when the gods received the bones of Dadhīca,
they took them to Tvaṣṭṛ and asked him to
fashion a Vajra out of the bones; Tvaṣṭṛ,
ritually ready ({%prayata%}) to receive the bones,
was glad to fashion the Vajra which he did
with great effort ({%prayatnāt%}) 3. 98. 22; when
the Vajra was ready, Tvaṣṭṛ asked Indra
to reduce his enemies to ashes with the
[Page131-b+ 40]
excellent Vajra ({%vajrapravara%}); Indra too
was happy and ritually ready ({%prayata%})
to receive it 3. 98. 23-24; (2) Vajra created
from the bones of Dadhīca in order to kill the
three-headed Viśvarūpa, son of Tvaṣṭṛ; when
the Vajra was fashioned by Dhātṛ, Viṣṇu
entered it ({%viṣṇupraviṣṭa%}); with the Vajra,
thus fortified, Indra cut off the heads of
Viśvarūpa 12. 329. 25-27; 1. 127. 12; (3)
during a conflict between the gods and the
demons Indra searched the three worlds for a
suitable weapon, but did not find it; he asked
the gods to approach the sage Dadhīca to ask
for his bones; when the bones were received,
Indra got prepared out of them various

Vajra missile, released it against Kṛṣṇa and
[Page133-a+ 40]
Arjuna ({%aśaniṃ gṛhya tarasā vajram%}

the two were killed 1. 218. 29-30; Kṛṣṇa
paralysed Indra who wanted to strike him
with Vajra (reference to the Khāṇḍava fire ?)
13. 143. 26, 23; (ii) when Indra could not
dissuade Uttaṅka from desisting to dig the
earth with just a stick, he joined his Vajrāstra
with the stick; the earth, torn asunder by the
strokes of Vajra, made way for Uttaṅka to
go to the Nāgaloka 14. 57. 31-32; 2. Inci-

threatened king Marutta, first through Agni,
that in case the king did not forsake Saṃ-
varta who acted as his priest at the sacri-
fice, he would hurl his Vajra at him 14. 9. 24;
he again threatened Marutta, through the Gan-
dharva Dhṛtarāṣṭra, that he would use his
Vajra against the king 14. 10. 1, 2, 4, 7;
Saṃvarta, however, assured Marutta that if
Indra with his Vajra arrived to strike the
king, he would paralyse Indra, and that he
had destroyed before the weapons of all the
gods; Saṃvarta then said: “let the wind
blow and may it drive away the Vajra to the
directions; let there be rain and may it fall

was still afraid of the sound of Vajra and of
the winds, and then Saṃvarta again assured
the king that he would become wind and
strike down the Vajra to dispel the king's
fear 14. 10. 15-16; (ii) Indra asked his
missile Vajra in the bodily form ({%mūrtisaṃs-%}
{%thita%}) to turn into a tiger and kill Suvarṇa-
[Page133-b+ 40]
ṣṭhīvin, son of king Sṛñjaya, as he was
afraid of the prince's growing strength 12.
31. 27-28; when Vajra ({%vajraḥ%}) was so
addressed, he began to look for a suitable
opportunity and when it arrived he, as tiger,
killed Suvarṇaṣṭhīvin; after killing the
prince, the tiger disappeared by the {%māyā%} of
Indra 12. 31. 29-34; (iii) when the sage
Cyavana wanted to offer Soma to Aśvinā
Indra objected to it; in spite of the objec-
tion, when Cyavana was about to fill
the cup for the Aśvinā, Indra threatened
Cyavana to strike him with Vajra; when
Cyavana still proceeded to fill the cup, and
Indra was about to strike the Vajra, Cyavana
paralysed Indra's arm 3. 124. 8, 15-17; 14. 9.
31-32; 12. 329. 14(3); 3. Mythological
incidents: (i) Vṛtra episode: (a) in the
battle between the gods and Vṛtra, helped by
the Kālakeyas, Indra released his Vajra to kill
Vṛtra; when struck by the Vajra, Vṛtra was
killed 3. 99. 1-3, 13-14; however, Indra felt
as if he had not released the Vajra from his
hand and that Vṛtra was not killed 3. 99. 15;
(b) when the gods approached Viṣṇu for his
help in their fight against Vṛtra, Viṣṇu advised
them to establish peace for the time being
with Vṛtra, and when the proper time came he
would enter the Vajra of Indra 5. 10. 11-12;
Vṛtra was ready to make peace if he would
not be attacked by Indra or by the gods with
anything that was dry or wet, which was stone
or wood, which was a weapon ({%śastra%}) or
Vajra, and if they would strike neither by
day nor by night 5. 10. 29; Indra killed Vṛtra
with foam which was fortified with Vajra;
Viṣṇu had entered that foam ({%savajram%}
{%atha phenaṃ taṃ kṣipraṃ vṛtre nisṛṣṭa-%}
{%vān / praviśya phenaṃ taṃ viṣṇur atha%}
{%vṛtraṃ vyanāśayat%}) 5. 10. 38; 3. 299. 15;
[Page134-a+ 40]
(c) Maheśvara told Indra to kill Vṛtra
with Vajra; Indra agreed 12. 272. 38-39; in
the fight that ensued, Indra came with Vajra
in his hand; he struck Vṛtra with Vajra; the
Vajra (m.) killed him; Viṣṇu had entered the
Vajra 12. 273. 5-7, 9; 12. 272. 31; 12. 274. 2;
(d) in the fight between Indra and Vṛtra,
when the latter covered the earth, Indra re-
leased his Vajra at him; Vṛtra then entered
successively water, fire, wind, and then ran
to ether ({%ākāśa%}); each time Indra struck
him with Vajra; finally Vṛtra entered Śakra
(Indra); in that condition Indra struck Vṛtra
with an invisible Vajra ({%adṛśyena vajreṇa%})
14. 11. 6-19; (ii) Viśvarūpa-Triśiras
episode: (a) when the gods led by Indra
approached god Brahman complaining that
Viśvarupa (Triśiras), son of Tvaṣṭṛ, drank
away all Soma offered in sacrifices, and that
they were left without a share, Brahman
advised them to approach the sage Dadhīca
and request him to give up his body; the gods
should then fashion a Vajra from the bones
of Dadhīca 12. 329. 24-25; when Dadhīca
gave up his body, Dhātṛ fashioned a Vajra
out of the bones; with that Vajra, produced
from the bones of a Brāhmaṇa and in which
god Viṣṇu had entered, Indra killed Viśvarūpa
and cut off his heads 12. 329. 27; (b)
when Indra failed to tempt Triśiras, son of
Tvaṣṭṛ, with Apsarases while he was practis-
ing penance, he decided to strike Vajra at
him; when struck by Vajra, Triśiras fell down
like the summit of a mountain; Indra was
still afraid of Triśiras and he asked a wood-
cutter ({%takṣan%}) to cut off the heads of the
lying Triśiras assuring Takṣan that he would
make his axe Vajra-like ({%matprasādād dhi%}
{%te śastraṃ vajrakalpaṃ bhaviṣyati%} 5. 9. 27);
the woodcutter finally cut off the heads of
[Page134-b+ 40]
Triśiras with his axe 5. 9. 15-34; (iii) Meet-
ing of Bali and Indra: when Indra met Bali
in the form of a donkey ({%khara%} 12. 216. 12),
Bali told Indra that he could fell down Indra
with his fist although Indra was equipped with
Vajra, but that that was the time to show for-
bearance ({%kṣamā%}) and not valour ({%vikrama%})
12. 217. 38-39; 12. 220. 79-80; Indra told
Bali that since he was asked by god Brahman
not to kill Bali, he was not releasing his
Vajra at him (Bali) (12. 218. 33); Indra
asked Bali why he was not grieved although
he was formerly struck by Vajra 12. 220.
18; Bali told Indra that he was not afraid of
him (Indra) although he saw him with his
Vajra raised ({%vajram udyamya tiṣṭhantam%})
12. 220. 21; Indra was surprised at the tran-
quility of Bali for he was not afraid of Indra
with Vajra raised in his hand 12. 220. 89;
(iv) Garuḍa episode: on his way to fetch
{%amṛta,%} when Garuḍa flew to the mountain
whose caves were blocked with snow, there
were bad omens for the gods; Indra's dear
missile Vajra blazed with pain ({%indrasya%}
{%vajraṃ dayitaṃ prajajvāla vyathānvitam%}) 1.
26. 28; when Garuḍa was taking away {%amṛta,%}
Indra struck him with Vajra; Garuḍa smiled
and told Indra that just out of respect for the
sage (Dadhīca) from whose bones the Vajra
was fashioned, out of respect for Vajra itself,
and Indra, he would let fall just one of his
feathers; otherwise, due to the blow of the
missile, he felt no pain at all; surprised, Indra
sought friendship with Garuḍa 1. 29. 17-23;
(v) Fight between the gods and Skanda:
when during the fight between the gods and
Skanda, the gods abandoned Indra, he released
his Vajra at Skanda; it struck Skanda on his
right side and split it open; due to the impact
of Vajra was produced another young man
[Page135-a+ 40]
({%puruṣo 'paraḥ / yuvā%}) with golden armour,
wearing heavenly {%kuṇḍalas,%} and holding
{%śakti;%} he became Viśākha since he was pro-
duced due to {%vajraviśana (yad vajraviśanāj%}

14 [{%viśana%} ‘opening made by the Vajra’ ?
Nīla.: ‘digging up of the arm’ {%bāhor%}
{%ākhananāt%} Bom. Ed. 3. 227. 17]; (vi)
Śiva and Indra: (a) Śiva, in the form of a
child in the lap of Umā, froze the arm of
Śakra which held Vajra (since apparently
Indra wanted to strike Vajra at the child
not realising that the child was Śiva); when
Brahmā and the other gods propitiated Śiva
(Rudra) and Umā, Indra's hand, holding the
Vajra, became as before 7. 173. 60-63; 13.
145. 30-34; (b) Indra once desirous to have
Maheśvara's glory hurled his Vajra at him;
it burnt Maheśvara's throat and departed;
that is why Śiva is called Śrīkaṇṭha ({%tena%}
{%śrīkaṇṭhatā mama;%} Nīla. {%śrakaṇṭhatā = nīla-%}
{%kaṇṭhatā%} on Bom. Ed. 13. 127. 47) 13. 128.
8; (vii) Indra and Mandara: Mandara, son
of Hiraṇyakaśipu, fought with Indra for a
million years; due to the boon he had obtained
from Mahādeva (Śiva) Indra's Vajra was
shattered on the limbs of the “tormentor”
({%graha ?%}) Mandara 13. 14. 53-54 (Nī.
{%grahasya mandāranāmnaḥ%} on Bom. Ed.
13. 14. 75). {@E.@} Knowledge of Vajra by
Arjuna and its use by him: Arjuna learnt
({%adhītavān%}) the Vajra missile from Indra
(and other missiles from Yama, Kubera,
and Varuṇa) 3. 89. 12; (i) Mātali advised
Arjuna to use Indra's favourite missile
against the Nivātakavaca demons; Arjuna
released ({%udīraya-%}) it after resorting to a
firm place ({%acalaṃ sthānam āsādya%}) and
after reciting the {%mantras%} on the Gāṇḍīva
bow ({%gāṇḍīvam anumantrya ca%}); the result
[Page135-b+ 40]
was that the sharp, iron arrows released from
his bow had the impact of Vajra ({%amuñcaṃ%}
{%vajrasaṃsparsān āyasān niśitāñ śarān%});
the arrows, propelled by the Vajra and which
had themselves become Vajra-like ({%te vajra-%}
{%coditā bāṇā vajrabhūtāḥ%}) pierced the {%māyās%}
of the demons and the demons themselves;
they all fell down on the ground when struck
by the impact ({%vega%}) of Vajra; the arrows
killed also those demons who had entered the
ground 3. 169. 12-17; (ii) Arjuna used the
Vajra missile to kill the Saṃśaptaka warriors
who showered arrows at Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna
to completely cover them 7. 26. 19-20.

for punishment and not as a missile:
(1) Sudhanvan warned Prahlāda that if,
in reply to a question, he told what was
false, Indra would pound his head with Vajra
into hundred pieces 2. 61. 63; (2) Bṛha-
spati told the gods what had been proclaimed
by Brahman in ancient times ({%purā gītaṃ%}
{%brahmaṇā%} 5. 12. 18): if one hands over
to the enemy the person who has sought
refuge, the gods with Indra strike him with
Vajra 5. 12. 21. {@H.@} Status: The best
among the weapons ({%āyudhānāṃ varo vajraḥ%}
(m.)) 4. 2. 13; an object of worship and
[Page136-b+ 38]
honour: (i) when Vajra struck Vṛtra's
head, it (the Vajra) was shattered into ten,
and then into hundred pieces; the gods shared
the pieces of Vajra among themselves and
worshipped them; (ii) whatever is efficaci-
ous in the world is supposed to have the
built of Vajra ({%loke yat sādhanaṃ kiṃcit%}
{%sā vai vajratanuḥ smṛtā%} 1. 158. 48);
hence a Brāhmaṇa's hand is considered
to be made of Vajra, a Kṣatriya has his
chariot of Vajra, a Vaiśya's gift is as
efficacious as Vajra, and those junior to a
Vaiśya (the Śūdras) are supposed to have
Vajra's strength in their service; the horses
of a Kṣatriya are as good as Vajra and
hence they are inviolable ({%vajrapāṇir brāh-%}

Vajra made ineffectual when Nīlakaṇṭha
(Śiva) granted a boon to Nārāyaṇa that
Vajra will not have any effect on him 7.
172. 77-78.
{@II.@} As Kṛṣṇa's missile: Kṛṣṇa cut off
all the mountains hurled at him by a demon
fighting from the side of Śālva, with his
dear missile Vajra which was capable of
breaking all rocks ({%sarvapāṣāṇabhedana%})
3. 23. 17.

{@IV.@} Vajra as a general missile, not
associated with any individual: Many Vajras
were used during the fight between Bhīma
and Karṇa 7. 113. 20; Vajras were used by the
Rākṣasas of Ghaṭotkaca against the Kaurava

to penetrate ({%durbhida%}), watching on all
sides ({%sarvatomukha%}), and terrible ({%ghora%})
6. 19. 34. {@C.@} Use in the epic war:
(1) Arjuna arranged the Pāṇḍava army
according to this Vyūha on the first day of
the war 6. 19. 6-7, 35; Bhīma led it
({%bhīmaseno 'graṇīs teṣām%}) 6. 19. 18,
({%dṛṣṭvāgrato bhīmasenam%}) 6. 19. 44,
({%bhīmaseno … pracakarṣa mahat sainyam%})
6. 19. 32; 6. 19. 8, 9; also in the forefront
stood Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Nakula, Sahadeva, and
Dhṛṣtaketu; Nakula and Sahadeva acted as
the protectors of the wheels of Bhīma's
chariot ({%cakrarakṣau%} 6. 19. 20), and the
sons of Draupadī and Abhimanyu protected
Bhīma from behind ({%pṛṣṭhagopāḥ%} 6. 19. 20);
Dhṛṣṭadyumna, helped by the Prabhadrakas,
offered protection to all of them (6. 19. 21);
the king (Virāṭa ?), surrounded by an army,
{%akṣauhiṇī%} strong, together with his brothers
and sons guarded them from behind;
Śikhaṇḍin, guarded by Arjuna, followed them;
Yuyudhāna (Sātyaki) protected Arjuna
from behind ({%pṛṣṭhagopa%}) and Yudhā-
manyu and Uttamaujas acted as his wheel-
protectors ({%cakrarakṣau%}); Yudhiṣṭhira, with
elephants, took position in the middle; the
Pāñcāla king Yajñasena with an army,
{%akṣauhiṇī%} strong, marched behind Virāṭa;
[Page137-b+ 40]
Dhṛṣṭadyumna, having moved from
his position, with his brothers and sons,
protected Yudhiṣṭhira from behind; hundreds
and thousands of foot-soldiers moved in the
front to protect Bhīmasena, while ten thou-
sand elephants followed Yudhiṣṭhira 6. 19.
18-31; according to 6. 22. 1-6, where the
name of the Vyūha is not mentioned but
the description of which apparently applies to
the arrangement of the Pāṇḍava army on the
first day, Yudhiṣṭhira himself directed the
contingents ({%anīkāni%}) of his army to counter
the Vyūha (Sarvatobhadra) of Bhīṣma;
Śikhaṇḍin's contingent stood in the middle,
protected by Arjuna (also 6. 22. 14); Dhṛṣṭa-
dyumna's contingent was protected by Bhīma
himself; the contingent on the right side of the
Vyūha ({%anīkaṃ dakṣiṇam%}) was protected by
Yuyudhāna (Sātyaki); Yudhiṣṭhira's chariot
was stationed in the midst of elephants;
Bhīma, along with Nakula and Sahadeva, is
said to be the guard of the chariot of the hero
({%vīrarathasya goptā%} i. e. Arjuna ? Dhṛṣṭa-
dyumna ?), but his position seems to be in
the front of the army ({%senāgragatam%}) 6.
22. 12-13; in many respects, this description
of the Vyūha agrees with that of the Vajra
given above (6. 19. 18-31); (2) On the
seventh day of the war Yudhiṣṭhira himself
used the Vajravyūha for his army (of which
no details are available) to counter the
Maṇḍalavyūha of the Kaurava army 6. 77. 21.

from Droṇa since he used it while displaying
his skill in archery (1. 125. 19), and at
the time of burning the Khāṇḍava forest

guarded all around by the Pāñcāla army,
acted as their protector; behind them was
Yudhiṣṭhira with Nakula and Sahadeva;
behind them moved Virāṭa surrounded by
his own army, and he was followed by
Drupada; the five Kekaya brothers and
Dhṛṣṭaketu guarded the rear ({%jaghanaṃ%}

Dhṛṣṭadyumna 5. 56. 11; (2) The counter-
Vyūha of the Kauravas used on that day:
the entire Kaurava army was led by Bhīṣma
({%agraṭaḥ sarvasainyānām%}); he was guarded
by the sons of Dhṛṭarāṣṭra; they were
followed by Droṇa and his son Aśvatthāman;
Bhagadatta, with his army of elephants,
followed them; Kṛpa and Kṛtavarman followed
Bhagadatta; next came Sudakṣiṇa, the king
of the Kāmbojas, Jayatsena, the king of the
Magadhas, and Bṛhadbala, the son of Subala;
other kings headed by Suśarman guarded
the rear ({%jaghanaṃ pālayām āsuḥ%})
6. 104. 15; similarly, during the war
at night (between the fourteenth and
the fifteenth day), the Kaurava army
was rearranged ({%punar vyūham akal-%}

Droṇa ?); this Vyūha is also not named;
Droṇa was in the front, Aśvatthāman and
Śakuni on either side, and Śalya in the rear;
Duryodhana himself protected all the wings

the ear-rings ({%kuṇḍalas%}) which Indra
would ask Karṇa to part with 3. 286.
14-15; after receiving this hint, Karṇa long-
ing for the Śakti waited for Vāsava (Indra)
3. 286. 20; when Indra came and begged
Karṇa of his {%kavaca%} and {%kuṇḍalas,%} Karṇa
asked Indra's unfailing Śakti in return 3. 294.
20-21; Indra agreed to part with his Śakti
under the stipulation that although the Śakti,
when used by Indra, would unfailingly kill
Indra's enemies {%by hundreds%} and return to
Indra's (user's) hand, when it reached Karṇa
it would kill only {%one%} illustrious, roaring and
tormenting enemy of Karṇa and return, not to
Karṇa, but to Indra ({%seyaṃ tava karaṃ prā-%}
{%pya hatvaikaṃ ripum ūrjitam / garjantaṃ%}
{%pratapantaṃ ca mām evaiṣyati sūtaja //%})
3. 294. 23-25; the Śakti, as long as it was
with Karṇa, would fail after killing one hero
[Page145-b+ 40]
and would lose its quality of being unfailing
({%ekavīravadhe moghā%}) 7. 157. 1, 7; ({%amo-%}
{%ghāyā vighātārtham%}) 7. 157. 12; Karṇa
agreed to receive the Śakti on that condition
for he feared danger in battle only from one
enemy 3. 294. 26, 29; Indra also warned
Karṇa not to use the Śakti when other missiles
were available with him and when he was
not in danger; if used negligently the
Śakti would boomerang on Karṇa ({%vidya-%}

{%pramatto mokṣyase cāpi tvayyevaiṣā%}
{%patiṣyati //%}) 3. 294. 33; Karṇa vowed to
Indra ({%satyam etad bravīmi te%}) that
he would release the Vāsavī (Śakti) only
when he was in great danger 3. 294. 34;
Karṇa then received the burning Sakti in
exchange of his {%kavaca%} and {%kuṇḍalas%} 3. 294.
35, 38; 8. 5. 65. {@C.@} What the Śakti meant
to Karṇa: Karṇa had great confidence due to
the Śakti ({%ayaṃ ca pratyayaḥ karṇe śaktyā%})
7. 157. 31; when Vāsava (Indra) gave the
Śakti to Karṇa, he (Karṇa) felt that Arjuna
was as good as dead 7. 155. 21-22; with
Śakti in Karṇa's hand, no one in the world
dare oppose him 7. 155. 13; Karṇa had
preserved the Śakti to kill Arjuna 7. 122. 33;
7. 148. 34; 7. 154. 53; the Śakti meant
death for Arjuna 7. 157. 38; Duḥśāsana,
Śakuni, Jayadratha and Duryodhana always
counselled Karṇa not to use the Śakti against
any one except Arjuna 7. 157. 32-34; (cf.
7. 157. 19-21 for the use of Śakti (not named)
only against Arjuna or Kṛṣṇa); if on any
occasion Karṇa's other missiles had failed and
if he was pressed ({%pīḍitaḥ%}) by the circums-
tances, he would certainly have used his
Vāsavī Śakti against Arjuna 7. 158. 54;
hence Kṛṣṇa protected Arjuna particularly
from the unfailing Śakti which, if released,
[Page146-a+ 40]
would certainly have killed him like the light-
ning striking down a tree 7. 157. 16;
according to Vyāsa too if Arjuna and
Karṇa had clashed, the latter, after exhaus-
ting all other missiles, would have surely
used Vāsavī against Arjuna 7. 158. 56;
Kṛṣṇa was therefore always looking for a
way to render the unfailing Śakti futile
({%amoghāṃ tāṃ kathaṃ śaktiṃ moghāṃ%}
{%kuryām%}) 7. 157. 29; when the Śakti was
diverted on Ghaṭotkaca, Karṇa, in the
opinion of Kṛṣṇa, was as good as dead
7. 155. 12; when Karṇa was relieved
of his Śakti, he became an ordinary
human being ({%so 'dya mānuṣatāṃ%}
{%prāpto vimuktaḥ śakradattayā%} 7. 155. 27),
and Arjuna could dare attack him 8. 22. 33.
{@D.@} Why the Śakti was not used against
Arjuna: Both Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Sātyaki asked
Saṃjaya and Kṛṣṇa respectively why the Śakti
was not used by Karṇa against Arjuna 7.
157. 1; 7. 158. 2-3; 7. 157. 31; (1) accor-
ding to Saṃjaya's reporting, Duryodhana,
Śakuni, Duḥśāsana, and he himself urged
Karṇa every night after the day's war to use
his Śakti the next day against Arjuna or
Kṛṣṇa (7. 157. 19-21), but that counsel was
forgotten the next day during the fight due
to the watchfulness of Kṛṣṇa ({%sā tu buddhiḥ%}
{%kṛtāpy evaṃ jāgrati tridaśeśvare / aprameye%}
{%hṛṣīkeśe yuddhakāle vyamuhyata%}) 7. 157. 27;
Kṛṣṇa also never brought Arjuna face to face
with Karṇa as long as the latter was equipped
with Śakti; Kṛṣṇa managed to see that
other warriors faced Karṇa 7. 157. 28-29;
according to Saṃjaya, again, the previous
night's counsel (7. 158. 4-5) was forgotten
by Karṇa the next day due to the deities
(unfavorable) to him and to the other heroes
(on the side of the Kauravas), and thus
[Page146-b+ 40]
it was primarily due to the working of the
fate that Karṇa did not employ his Śakti
against Arjuna or Kṛṣṇa to kill any one of
them ({%tataḥ prabhātasamaye rājan karṇasya%}
{%daivataiḥ / anyeṣāṃ caiva yodhānāṃ sā%}
{%buddhir naśyate punaḥ // daivam eva paraṃ%}

{%jaghāna raṇe pārthaṃ kṛṣṇaṃ vā devakī-%}
{%sutam //%} 7. 158. 6-7; also 8-9; (2) accor-
ding to Vyāsa too it was due to fate
({%diṣṭyā%}) that Arjuna was not locked in
a duel with Karṇa prior to the latter's being
relieved of the Śakti 7. 158. 54; according
to him Ghaṭotkaca was killed by Time
using Vāsavī as his means ({%vāsavīṃ%}
{%kāraṇaṃ kṛtvā kālenāpahato hy asau%})
7. 158. 58; (3) according to Kṛṣṇa he
deluded the mind of Karṇa and hence he did
not use his Śakti against Arjuna ({%aham%}
{%eva tu rādheyaṃ mohayāmi yudhāṃ vara%}
7. 157. 37; (4) according to Dhṛtarāṣṭra
both fate and the intelligence of Kṛṣṇa
came together to defeat the purpose of the
Kauravas and hence the Vāsavī (Śakti)
killed Ghaṭotkaca instead of Arjuna
({%daivenaiva hatā yūyaṃ svabuddhyā%}
{%keśavasya ca / gatā hi vāsavī hatvā%}
{%tṛṇabhūtaṃ ghaṭotkacam%}) 7. 158. 10.
{@E.@} Use: (1) By Karṇa: All the Kuru
warriors urged Karṇa to kill the demon
Ghaṭotkaca by using the Śakti given to him
by Vāsava and save the Kauravas and their
warriors from destruction; hearing that call,
Karṇa held the Śakti desiring to kill Ghaṭot-
kaca, that Śakti given to him by Śakra
and which he had preserved for Arjuna
for years; when the missile was released,
Ghaṭotkaca, afraid, assumed a huge form
of the foot of the Vindhya mountain and
fled; the beings in the mid-region wailed
[Page147-a+ 40]
at the sight of the Śakti; the released Śakti
first burnt the {%māyā%} of Ghaṭotkaca, and
then broke open deeply the chest of Ghaṭot-
kaca and went up in the sky, shining at night,
to enter the spaces between the {%nakṣatras%}
({%ūrdhvaṃ yayau dīpyamānā niśāyāṃ%}
{%nakṣatrāṇām antarāṇy āviśantī%} 7. 154. 57);
Ghaṭotkaca, with his vitals pierced by the
Śakti, was killed 7. 154. 48-59; 7. 156. 24;
7. 158. 10; 8. 5. 71; by asking Ghaṭotkaca
to fight with Karṇa, Kṛṣṇa diverted the Śakti
on him 7. 156. 27; 7. 157. (5), 6, 39;
7. 155. 12, 14; (Kṛṣṇa said that if
Karṇa had not killed Ghaṭotkaca with his
Śakti, he would have killed Ghaṭotkaca
7. 156. 25); (2) By Indra: When used
by Indra while fighting with the Daityas,
the Śakti, after killing his enemies by hun-
dreds, returned to Indra's hand 3. 294. 24;
3. 286. 16 (killing of the enemies by
hundreds and thousands). [See {@Śakti<sup>2-5</sup>@}]

Aśvatthāman was forbidden to use the
Brahmaśiras astra on any occasion whatso-
ever; so he wanted to exchange Brahmaśiras
for Kṛṣṇa's Sudarśana; Kṛṣṇa allowed Aśva-
tthāman to choose any one of his missiles,
including the Cakra, which he felt he could
wield and use in the battle; Aśvatthāman opted
for the Cakra, and when allowed by Kṛṣṇa
to take it, he first tried to pick it up with his
left hand; failing to move it, he tried his right
hand; when he could not move the Cakra
even with his right hand, he used all his might
(i. e. probably used both his hands together);
having failed in this attempt too, Aśvatthāman
in despair abandoned the attempt; Kṛṣṇa then
told him that he had asked for something very
unusual, for not even Arjuna, Pradyumna,
(Bala)rāma, Gada, Sāmba, nor any one of
the Vṛṣṇi and Andhaka heroes living in
Dvārakā had asked for it; Kṛṣṇa, out of
curiosity, asked Aśvatthāman whom he wanted
to fight with equipped with Sudarśana; Aśva-
tthāman admitted that he wanted to fight
with Kṛṣṇa himself and become invincible;
Aśvatthāman realised that the Cakra would
not leave Kṛṣṇa and hence he left Dvārakā
[Page155-a+ 40]
without it 10. 12. 14-38. {@F.@} Its use:
(1) In wars or events not related to the
epic: (i) when Viṣṇu was distributing the
{%amṛta%} among the gods, Rāhu cunningly
managed to get it; as the {%amṛta%} had
reached Rāhu's throat, Viṣṇu used the Cakra
to cut off his head; when severed by the
Cakra, the head fell on the ground and shook
the earth 1. 17. 5-7; (ii) in the war that
ensued between the gods and the demons
after the above incident Nara and Nārāyaṇa
appeared on the scene; Viṣṇu (Narāyaṇa)
then thought of his Sudarśana cakra; as soon
as thought of, it arrived from the sky ({%tato%}
{%'mbarāc cintitamātram āgatam%} 1. 17. 20);
armed with it, Viṣṇu used it against the
demons; it struck them again and again and
cut off the Daityas to pieces in thousands;
sometimes it licked the Dānavas and, over-
powering them, cut them off; sometimes it
burnt them like fire; hurled now in the sky
and then on the ground it drunk their blood
like a Piśāca; having heard that the Sudar-
śana cakra was angry, the demons disappeared
entering the earth and the ocean 1. 17. 18-28;
(iii) in Kṛṣṇa's war with Śālva who was
fighting from his Saubhapura, Kṛṣṇa released
his sharp-edged discuss, here called his dear
({%dayita%}) Āgneya astra (3. 23. 28), after
reciting {%mantras%} over it ({%abhimantrya%} 3.
23. 30) and using the strength of his arm
({%bhujavīryeṇa%} 3. 23. 31); Kṛṣṇa directed
his Cakra to strike down with its might the
Saubha and all the enemies living there; the
missile cut into two the Saubha town in the
middle as a saw might cut a pillar; after
achieving its objective the missile returned to
Kṛṣṇa's hand; Kṛṣṇa again shook it upwards
with great speed and released it with the
words: “(now) for Śālva” ({%punaś cod-%}
[Page155-b+ 40]
{%dhūya vegena śālvāyety aham abruvam%} 3. 23.
35); the discuss instantly cut Śālva into two,
who was then wielding a heavy {%gadā,%} and
then it blazed with its lustre 3. 23. 28-36;
(2) In wars or events related to the epic:
(1) at the time of the Khāṇḍava fire, Kṛṣṇa
killed many hosts of Daityas and Dānavas
with his Cakra; many others, were blown
away by the speed of the Cakra ({%cakra-%}
{%vegeritāḥ%}) 1. 218. 26-27; in this incident
Kṛṣṇa released his Cakra on animals and
other beings ({%tathānyā bhūtajātayaḥ%} 1. 219.
2) so that these, along with the Dānavas and
the night-stalkers ({%sadānavaniśācarāḥ%} 1. 219.
4) were cut into pieces by hundreds and they
fell into the fire; the Rākṣasas, cut by the
Cakra of Kṛṣṇa, looked like evening clouds;
Kṛṣṇa moved there like the god of Death kill-
ing by thousands Piśācas, birds, serpents and
animals with his Cakra; the Cakra, repeatedly
hurled, killed many beings and returned to
Kṛṣṇa's hand 1. 219. 2-7; if the Rākṣasas,
Dānavas and serpents tried to escape to-
gether ({%ekāyanagatāḥ saṅghībhūtāḥ%} Nī. on
1. 228. 34 Bom. Ed.) even then Kṛṣṇa killed
them and they fell into the flaming fire 1. 219.
30-31; Kṛṣṇa saw Asura Maya fleeing from
the house of Takṣaka and when Agni showed
his desire to burn him, Kṛṣṇa stood ready with
his raised Cakra to kill him; but Maya sought
help from Arjuna and was saved 1. 219.
35-39; (2) Enraged Kṛṣṇa cut off the head
of Śiśupāla with Cakra at the time of the
Rājasūya 2. 42. 21; 3. 15. 3-4; 12-13 (use
of Cakra not mentioned). {@G.@} Threatened
or eventual use in the epic war: (1) Dis-
appointed at Arjuna's softness ({%mṛduyuddha-%}
{%tām%} 6. 55. 63, 80) while fighting with Bhīṣma,
Kṛṣṇa took up his discuss ({%rathāṅgam%}) with
a view to killing Bhīṣma; raising his Cakra he
[Page156-a+ 40]
jumped down from the chariot and proceeded
on foot to attack Bhīṣma; the Sudarśana,
lotus-like and having a beautiful nave, shone
like the primeval lotus ({%ādipadma%}) rising
from the navel of Nārāyaṇa; seeing Kṛṣṇa
equipped with Cakra all beings cried aloud
thinking that that was the end of the Kurus;
Kṛṣṇa, holding the Cakra and jumping along,
looked as if he was revolving the world, or
he looked like the god of Death in the form of
Fire burning the creatures ({%saṃvartayiṣyann%}
{%iva jīvalokam / … bhūtāni dhakṣyann iva%}
{%kālavahniḥ%}) 6. 55. 92); (2) seeing Kṛṣṇa
rushing towards him with Cakra in hand,
Bhīṣma invited him from his chariot to put
an end to his life; when Arjuna, coming
from behind, assured Kṛṣṇa that he would
destroy the Kurus, Kṛṣṇa returned and holding
the discuss, mounted the chariot 6. 55. 83,
86-87, 89-94, 100-101; (3) Apprehending
that Arjuna might not be able to fulfil his vow
to kill Jayadratha before sunset, Kṛṣṇa thought
that his intervention in the war might become
necessary and he therefore asked Dāruka, his
charioteer, to keep his chariot ready with all
the missiles in it, including Cakra, so that he
would destroy the enemy's army with it 7.
56. 32, 28. (4) Kṛṣṇa, in order to incite
Arjuna who was somewhat overpowered
by Karṇa, showed readiness to give his
Cakra to him to cut off Karṇa's head with
it 8. 65. 19. {@H.@} Actual or possible defeat
of Sudarśana: (1) Viṣṇu's Cakra was
shattered on the limbs of Mandara, the son
of Hiraṇyakaśipu, owing to a boon Mandara
had received from Mahādeva (Śiva) 13. 14.
54; (2) even Kṛṣṇa with his Sudarśana
would not be able to vanquish Karṇa as long
as he was armed with Indra's ({%vāsavī%})
Śakti and was protected by his armour and

When the end of the Yādavas had arrived and
when they started for the {%tīrthayātrā%} on the
shore of the ocean, the Cakra, given to
Kṛṣṇa by Agni, left him and rose to the sky
even as the Vṛṣṇis watched it 16. 4. 3; when
Yudhiṣṭhira relinquished the kingdom to
Parikṣit and the Pāṇḍavas started for the
forest, god Agni appeared in bodily form
(17. 1. 33) and told them that the excellent
Cakra which stayed with Kṛṣṇa had dis-
appeared and that it would return to his hand
at the proper time ({%cakraratnaṃ tu yat%}

Mahābhārata at the hands of Vaiśāṃpāyana

ning of the different {%parvans (nārāyaṇaṃ%}
{%namaskṛtya naraṃ caiva narottamam /%}
{%devīṃ sarasvatīṃ caiva tato jayam udīra-%}

according to V. S. Sukthankar, however,
“ … Jaya is a {%generic%} name applicable to
different works, and not a specific name of
the Mahābhārata at all as believed by some
writers” (Ādiparvan, p. 989, note on 56. 19);
the recitation of this kind of Itihāsa should
be heard by a king who desires victory; he
then conquers the earth and shall defeat his
enemies; it should also often be heard by a
chief queen since it is as good as a rite
calculated to lead to the birth of a son ({%puṃ-%}
{%savanam%}) and by a crown prince since it
is the royal road to welfare ({%svastyayanaṃ%}
{%mahat%}) 1. 56. 19-20; its recitation is re-
commended for a king desiring prosperity
({%bhūtim%}), for princes in general, and for
any pregnant woman; it is also said that
hearing it one who desires heaven will
go to heaven, one who wants victory will
win victory, and a pregnant woman will
deliver a son or a fortunate girl ({%putraṃ%}
{%kanyāṃ vā bahubhāginīm%}) 18. 5. 39-40; the
narrative called the Vidurāputrānuśāsana
(5. 131-135) is also classed as the Jaya
type of Itihāsa 5. 134. 17; a minister should
recite this to a king who is oppressed by his
enemies and who is dejected since this tract,
being a powerful exhortation, is best suited
to cause increase in energy ({%idam uddha-%}

who listens to it or one who recites it, having
bowed down to Bhagavān and with attentive
mind, is freed from disease, becomes lustrous,
[Page188-b+ 40]
and gets strength and good complexion; one
who is suffering from illness is freed of
illness, one held in captivity is released from
bonds, one who entertains desires obtains them
and long life; a Brāhmaṇa thereby knows all,
a Kṣatriya is victorious, a Vaiśya obtains
much profit and a Śūdra becomes happy; one
who is devoid of a son has a son; a maiden
gets the cherished husband, the woman who
experiences difficulty in delivery delivers easily
({%lagnagarbhā vimucyate%}), a pregnant woman
delivers a son, a barren woman has abundant
progeny consisting of sons and grandsons;
one who recites this while on journey reaches
his destination safely; (in short) whatever
desire a person entertains that he definitely
gets; this is the considered assurance of the
great sage ({%idaṃ maharṣer vacanaṃ viniś-%}
{%citam%}) that by listening to the praise of the
Excellent Person ({%puruṣavara%}) the devotees
are very comfortable ({%niśamya bhaktāḥ su-%}

this summary began with the return of
the Pāṇḍavas to Hāstinapura after the
death of Pāṇḍu and it ended with the death
of Duryodhana and the Pāṇḍavas obtaining
the kingdom 1. 55. 6-42; a sort of a sum-
mary which began with Pāṇḍu's conquering
many countries and then retiring to the forest
[Page196-a+ 40]
and ended with the great destruction after the
war leaving only ten heroes alive is made by
Sūta Ugraśravas for the sages assembled in
the Naimiṣa forest 1. 1. 67-158. {@G.@} Three
beginnings: According to Sūta Ugraśravas
there were three different views regarding the
beginning of the Bhārata: (1) according
to one view it began with Manu Vaivasvata
({%manvādi bhārataṃ kecit%}) 1. 1. 50 (i. e.
with {%prajāpates tu dakṣasya manor vaivas-%}
{%vatasya ca / … anvaye // yādavānām imaṃ%}
{%vaṃśaṃ pauravāṇāṃ ca sarvaśaḥ / tathaiva%}
{%bhāratānāṃ ca%} (?) 1. 70. 1-2); Devabodha
on 1. 1. 50 explains {%manuḥ%} as {%ādirājaḥ;%}
according to Nī. on Bom. Ed. 1. 1. 52, in
the opinion of the easterners, {%manu%} means
{%mantra%} and hence {%manvādi%} refers to the
{%maṅgala%} stanza {%nārāyaṇaṃ namaskṛtya%} etc.
or {%om namo bhagavate%} etc. found at the
beginning of the epic in some manuscripts;
in his own opinion, however, {%manu%} refers to
Manu Vaivasvata, the son of the heaven, cf.
{%manur mantraḥ nārāyaṇaṃ namaskṛtyeti /%}
{%om namo bhagavate vāsudevāyeti vā tadādi%}
{%iti prañcaḥ / divaḥ putro vaivasvatamahya-%}
{%saṃjño manus tadādīti tattvam /%}); (2)
according to another view the Bhārata
begins with {%āstīka (āstīkādi tathāpare)%}
1. 1. 50 (i. e. with the {%adhyāya%} 1. 13
beginning of the Āstīkaparvan); (3) accor-
ding to a third view it begins with {%uparicara%}
{%(tathoparicarād anye)%} 1. 1. 50 (i. e. with
{%rājoparicaro nāma%} 1. 57. 1). {@H.@} Its
first teaching and subsequent narrations:
(1) Teaching: Dvaipāyana (Vyāsa) first
taught it to his son Śuka and then handed
it over to his other deserving pupils 1. 1. 63;
he taught it to Śuka together with the four
{%ślokas%} (18. 5. 47-50) known as the Bhārata-
sāvitrī 18. 5. 51; Vyāsa taught the Mahabhā-
[Page196-b+ 40]
rata to his pupils Sumantu, Jaimini, Paila,
Vaiśaṃpāyana and to his son Śuka 1. 57.
74-75; Vyāsa taught it to them on the mount
Meru 12. 327. 16-18; on the slope of the
Himavant mountain ({%himavatpāde%}) 12. 337.
9, 12, 14-15 ({%vedārthān bhāratārthāṃś ca%}
{% … vyāhartum upacakrame%}); (2) Narra-
tions: (i) Nārada recited it for the gods,
Asita Devala for the manes ({%pitṛn%}), and
Śuka for the Gandharvas, the Yaksas and the
demons 1. 1. 64; 18. 5. 42; (ii) The pupils
of Vyāsa made separate public recitations of
the Bhārata saṃhitā received by them from
him ({%saṃhitās taiḥ pṛthaktvena bhāratasya%}
{%prakāśitāḥ%}) 1. 57. 75; (iii) one such reci-
tation by his pupil Vaiśaṃpāyana is recorded
in the epic: When Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana arrived
at the snake-sacrifice of Janamejaya he was
requested by the king to narrate to him the
life-story of the Kurus and the Pāṇḍavas
(1. 54. 18 ff.); Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana then
asked his pupil Vaiśaṃpāyana to narrate it
as the latter had heard it from him; Vaiśaṃ-
pāyana then narrated the whole {%purātana%}
{%itihāsa%} to the king, and to those who had
assembled in the {%sadas,%} and to all other
Kṣatriyas ({%tasmai rājñe sadasyebhyaḥ%}
{%kṣatriyebhyaś ca sarvaśaḥ%}) 1. 54. 21-24;
1. 1. 8-10; 1. 1. 18; 1. 1. 57-58; 1. 55. 2-3;
1. 55. 4-43 (summary); 18. 5. 26, 30, 42;
18. 1. 2; (iv) but in one place the {%ākhyāna%}
is said to have been narrated by Vyāsa
himself to Janamejaya continuously ({%vyāsas%}
{%tv akathayan nityam ākhyānaṃ bhārataṃ%}

assembled in the Naimiṣa forest for the
twelve-yearly sacrificial session of Śaunaka

44. 4-5; the nineteen classes of beings (7
{%grāmya paśus,%} 7 {%āraṇya paśus,%} 5 {%ud-%}
{%bhijjas%}) and the five {%mahābhūtas,%} which
make a total of twenty-four are identi-

Gāyatrī ({%eṣāṃ viṃśatir ekonā mahābhūteṣu%}
{%pañcasu / caturviṃśatir uddiṣṭā gāyatrī%}
{%lokasaṃmatā //%}) 6. 5. 15-18. {@C.@} Its
close association with the Vedas used for
a simile: As the Sāvitrī {%mantra%} does not
forsake the Vedas, so did Yājñasenī (Drau-
padī) not forsake the Pāṇḍavas 3. 80. 4.
{@D.@} Relationship with deities: (1) Savitṛ:
Sāvitrī was (first) pronounced in the east by
god Savitṛ to the {%brahmavādins%} 5. 106. 10;
3. 110. 5 ({%? sāvitrīṃ savitā yathā (dadau)%});
(2) Nārāyaṇa: On the Śveta Dvīpa, Nārada
saw {%oṃkāra,%} followed by Sāvitrī, coming out
of the mouth of Nārāyaṇa 12. 326. 7; (3)
[Page219-a+ 40]
Śiva: when Rudra got ready to destroy the
Tripuras he made the Vedas his bow and the
Sāvitrī {%mantra%} his bow-string 13 145. 27;
{@E.@} Personification: (1) Sāvitrī, in bodily
form, present in the Sabhā of Brahmadeva 2.
11. 25; Sāvitrī, along with the Vedas and the
Upaniṣads attended the sacrifice of Śiva when
he had assumed the form of Varuṇa 13. 85. 6.
{@F.@} Uses: (1) In {%śrāddha:%} One should atten-
tively recite the Sāvitrī prayer at each oblation
given to the manes at the {%śrāddha (brūyāc%}
{%chrāddhe ca sāvitrīṃ piṇḍe piṇḍe samā-%}

{%devatyāḥ pāvamānīś ca japet%}); (2) for use
as a test (?): If a person born of a mixture of
castes recites Gāyatrī at the renowned {%tīrtha%}
called Gāyatryāḥ sthānam it sounds like a
{%gāthā%} (a non-Vedic stanza) or an ordinary
song. This was a direct proof available for a
Brāhmaṇa to prove that he was not of mixed
origin ({%nidarśanaṃ ca pratyakṣaṃ brāh-%}
{%maṇānāṃ narādhipa / gāyatrīṃ paṭhate yas%}
{%tu yonisaṃkarajas tathā / gāthā vā gītikā%}

on Bom. Ed. 3. 85. 29: {%nidarśānam udā-%}

invoked Sāvitrī mantra for the protection
of Kṛṣṇa when he set out for the Himavant
to meet Śiva ({%sāvitrī brahmavidyā ca ṛtavo%}
{%vatsarāḥ kṣapāḥ / … rakṣantu sarvatra gataṃ%}
{%tvām yādava sukhāvaham //%} 13. 14. 22-23).
{@G.@} Qualifications and rewards obtained by
its knowledge and recitation: Brāhmaṇas who
know Sāvitrī, so also the one who recites
Sāvitrī three times a day, are worthy of being
invited for a {%śrāddha (sāvitrījñāḥ kriyā-%}
{%vantas te rājan ketanakṣamāḥ)%} 13. 24. 25,
({%sāvitrīṃ japate yas tu trikālam … sa rājan%}

{%ketanakṣamaḥ%}) 13. 24. 28; one who recites
Sāvitrī on a sacred spot, eating limited food,
not injuring others, alert ({%? amandakaḥ%}), not
talking to any one is freed of all sins 12. 36.
33 (Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 12. 35. 37:
{%manda iva mandakaḥ rāgadveṣamānāpa-%}
{%mānaśūnyaḥ%}); one who knows the real nature
of Gāyatrī (i. e. the identification of its 24

where Duryodhana, whose thighs were

(Aśvatthāman); where the enraged Drauṇi
vowed that he would not take off his armour

of Draupadī, Bhīma pursued Aśvatthāman;
where Aśvatthāman, afraid of Bhīmasena,

him saying it was for the destruction of the
Pāṇḍava’ ({%apāṇḍavāyeti ruṣā drauṇir%}

{@A.@} Original composer and transmission:
Originally Brahmā sang the Stava ({%yat%}

{%purā lokakṛj jagau%}) 13. 16. 66; {%yad uktaṃ%}
{%padmayoninā%} 13. 17. 12) and himself

17. 5; 13. 16. 66; from him it went
successively to Śakra (Indra) and others 13.
17. 164-168; one of the receivers in this
line was Taṇḍi who obtained it in the abode
of Brahman after he had performed severe
austerities 13. 17. 165; he handed it over to
Śukra Bhārgava 13. 16. 66; 13. 16. 75 (?);
at the end of the line of transmission stood
Mārkaṇḍeya who taught it to Upamanyu
when the latter had observed certain rules
({%mārkaṇḍeyān mayā prāptaṃ niyamena%}
{%janārdana%} 13. 17. 169) and Upamanyu
gave it to Janārdana (Kṛṣṇa) 13. 17. 168-
169; 13. 17. 1, 5-6; since, in bygone days,
it was once taught by Taṇḍi it also came
to be looked upon as composed by Taṇḍi;
moreover Taṇḍi had brought it down from
heaven to this world ({%yasmāt taṇḍiḥ purā%}

received it directly from Taṇḍi ({%taṇḍir%}
{%ākhyātavān mama / nāmāni%}) 13. 16. 73,
72. {@B.@} Activity of Upamanyu: Pitāmaha
(Brahmadeva) had mentioned ten thousand
names of Sarva (Śiva) in the Vedas and
one thousand names of Śarva (Śiva) in the
Śāstras ({%daśa nāmasahasrāṇi vedeṣv āha%}
{%pitāmahaḥ / śarvasya śāstreṣu tathā daśa%}

Upamanyu made an abridgement (in the

Stavarāja is equal to meditation, practice of
Yoga, the best thing to meditate on; it
deserves to be recited; it is itself knowledge
and the highest secret; if one knows it even
at the end of one's life one can attain the
highest state after life ({%idaṃ dhyānam%}

great, eternal secret was proclaimed by
Brahman himself ({%yat tad rahasyaṃ para-%}

{@F.@} Who may receive the Stavarāja: It may
be taught to one who is devoted (to god), to
one who has faith, and one who believes in
god; but it should not be taught to a non-
believer who is lack of faith in the bodily
form and who has not controlled his self

rāja one obtains all desires 13. 17. 29; by
reciting this Stava the sage Kṛṣṇadvaipāyana
obtained all his desires while he was practis-
ing austerities on mount Meru for a son; he
therefore advised Yudhiṣṭhira to recite the
{%stava%} so that he would also obtain all his

Bhīma that the Kaliyuga will commence
soon (after the Dvāpara) ({%eatat kaliyugaṃ%}

Mārkaṇḍeya told Yudhiṣṭhira that the Kali
Yuga lasts for 1000 years; it is preceded by
dawns of 100 years and followed by evenings

{@D.@} Events marking the advent of the Kali
Yuga: (1) The armies of the Kurus and the
Pāṇḍavas fought each other near the Samanta-
pañcaka at the junction of the Dvāpara
[Page235-a+ 40]
and the Kali Yuga ({%antare caiva saṃ-%}
{%prāpte kalidvāparayor abhūt / samanta-%}
{%pañcake yuddhaṃ kurupāṇḍavasenayoḥ%})
1. 2. 9; (2) Nārāyaṇa told Apāntaratamas
that when the Tiṣyayuga will have set in the
kings born in the line of Bharata, known as
the Kurus, will be born of him (i. e. of Apān-
taratamas then born as Vyāsa) and that
there will be a feud in the family leading to
mutual destruction (here Tiṣya, i. e. Kali,
is mentioned in place of Dvāpara due to
close proximity ?) ({%punas tiṣye ca saṃprā-%}

(3) Nārāyaṇa told Nārada that at the end
of the junction of the Dvāpara and the
Kali age he would appear in Mathurā for
the killing of Kaṃsa ({%dvāparasya kaleś%}
{%caiva saṃdhau paryavasānike / prādurbhā-%}
{%vaḥ kaṃsahetoḥ mathurāyāṃ bhaviṣyati%})
12. 326. 82; (4) at the end of the Dvā-
para and the beginning of the Kali age
Vāsudeva (Kṛṣṇa), along with Saṃkarṣaṇa,
is sung according to the Sātvata mode of
worship ({%dvāparasya yugasyānte ādau%}
{%kaliyugasya ca / sātvataṃ vidhism āsthāya%}
{%gītaḥ saṃkarṣaṇena yaḥ%}) 6. 62. 39. {@E.@}
Kaliyuga and Nārāyaṇa and Vyāsa: (1)
Bhīṣma told Yudhiṣṭhira that in the Kali
Yuga Kṛṣṇa came down to the earth as
{%adharma (kṛṣṇaḥ / kalāv adharmaḥ kṣitim%}
{%ājagāma%} 13. 143. 9; Nī. on Bom. Ed. 13.
158. 10: {%kalau tv adharma eva balavān iti%}
{%bhāvaḥ%}); the god (Nārāyaṇa i. e. Kṛṣṇa-
Janārdana 3. 187. 52, 50) told Mārkaṇḍeya
that he has dark colour in the Kaliyuga
({%kṛṣṇaḥ kaliyuge tathā%}) 3. 187. 31;
{%tāmasaṃ yugam āsādya kṛṣṇo bhavati%}
[Page235-b+ 40]
{%keśavaḥ%}) 3. 148. 33; (2) Hari-Nārāyaṇa
told Apāntaratamas (12. 337. 38) that when
Kṛṣṇayuga (i. e. Kaliyuga) sets in he (as
Vyāsa) will have dark colour ({%kṛṣṇe yuge%}
{%ca saṃprāpte kṛṣṇavarṇo bhaviṣyasi%}) 12.
337. 44. {@F.@} King and the Kali Yuga:
All the Yugas are dependent on the king's
behaviour, hence a king is called a {%yuga%}
{%(rājavṛttāni sarvāṇi rājaiva yugam ucyate)%}
12. 92. 6; according to Bhīṣma all the
Yugas, including Kali, are rooted in a king
({%rājamūlāni sarvāṇi%}) 12. 139. 10; it is the
king who makes the Yugas what they are and
hence he is also the cause of the fourth Yuga
(i. e. the Kaliyuga) ({%yugasya ca caturtha-%}
{%sya rājā bhavati kāraṇam%}) 5. 130. 16; 12.
70. 25; by bringing about the Kali age the
king incurs immense sin ({%kaleḥ pravartanād%}
{%rājā pāpam atyantam aśnute%}) 12. 70. 27;
by bringing about the Kaliyuga (not directly
stated) the evil-doer (i. e. the king) lives
eternally in the hell ({%tato vasati duṣkarmā%}
{%narake śāśvatīḥ samāḥ%}) 5. 130. 18; when
the king wholly gives up {%daṇḍanīti%} and
oppresses his subjects unjustly the Kali age
makes its appearance ({%daṇḍanītiṃ paritya-%}
{%jya yadā kārtsnyena bhūmipaḥ / prajāḥ%}
{%kliśnāty ayogena praviśyati tadā kaliḥ%})
12. 70. 18; where the sinful ones move about
freely among the righteous, there the Kali
age (? or the evil spirit ?) meets the kings
({%? yatra pāpā jñāyamānāś caranti satāṃ%}
{%kalir vindati tatra rājñāḥ%}) 12. 92. 27
(Nī. on Bom. Ed. 12. 91. 28: {%rājñaḥ%}
{%nṛpān%}). {@G.@} Kali Yuga and {%dharma:%}
While describing the four Yugas Hanūmant
told Bhīma that in the Kali Yuga {%dharma%}
stands only on one foot ({%pādenaikena%}
{%kaunteya dharmaḥ kaliyuge sthitaḥ%}) 3.
148. 32; ({%pādena tv apare%} (i. e. {%kalau%})

327. 76 (however, commentator Vādirāja:
{%tiṣye puṣyanakṣatre,%} note on this stanza in
the Cr. Ed.); 12. 224. 23; gods asked
Bhagavān Nārāyaṇa what they should do
when the {%dharma%} in the Tiṣya Yuga stood
on one foot 12. 327. 77; in the Kali Yuga
(not directly mentioned) {%adharma%} rules
over men in three parts while {%dharma%} attends
men only in one part ({%tribhir aṃśair%}
{%adharmas tu lokān ākramya tiṣṭhati /catur-%}
{%thāṃśena dharmas tu manuṣyān upati-%}
{%ṣṭhati%}) 3. 188. 12; in the Kali Yuga {%dharma%}
is reduced to its sixteenth {%kolā%} on account
of the misbehaviour of kings ({%tathā kaliyuge%}
{%prāpte rājñāṃ duścaritena ha / bhavet%}
{%kālaviśeṣṇa kalā dharmasya ṣoḍaśī%}) 12.
259. 33. {@H.@} Nature of the Kali Yuga
and its effects on men: Vedic practices dwin-
dle, so also the religious and the sacrificial
rites; on the other hand, seasonal calamities,
diseases, lassitude, vices like anger and
others, calamities and mental agonies are ex-
perienced ({%vedācārāḥ praśāmyanti dharma-%}
{%yajñakriyās tathā //ītayo vyādhayas%}
{%tandrī doṣāḥ krodhādayas tathā / upadravāś%}
{%ca vartante ādhayo vyādhayas tathā //%} 3.
148. 33-34; also cf. 3. 186. 24-55; 3. 188.
5-6, 13-84; 12. 224. 62; in the Kali Yuga
the Vedas are seen (i. e. practised) by some
and not by others; they, which alone serve as
dams of {%dharma,%} fall into ruin along with
the sacrifices ({%dṛśyante nāpi dṛśyante vedāḥ%}
{%kaliyuge 'khilāḥ / utsīdante sayajñāś ca%}
{%kevalā dharmasetavaḥ //%}) 12. 224. 66; 12.
230. 15-17; the study of the Vedas dwindles
gradually in each succeeding Yuga ({%veda-%}
{%vādāś cānuyugaṃ hrasantīti ca naḥ śrutam%})
[Page236-b+ 40]
12. 224. 25; the {%adharma%} in the Yugas
other than the Kṛta is on increase due to the
practice of theft, falsehood and deceipt 12.
224. 23; the duties ({%dharmāḥ%}) to be followed
in the Kali Yuga are different (from those of
the other Yugas); they have been prescribed
as if keeping in mind the (lowered) capacity
of men in that age ({%anye kaliyuge dharmā%}
{%yathāśaktikṛtā iva%}) 12. 224. 26 = 12. 252. 8;
giving gifts is specially recommended for the
Kali Yuga ({%dānam eva kalau yuge%}) 12.
224. 27; in the Kali age {%adharma%} is practised
by many, and {%dharma%} only by a few; all
the Varṇas are disinclined to follow {%dharma%}
proper to them 12. 70. 19; also 20-24; the
nature of men in the Puṣyayuga is describ-
ed also in 6. 11. 12-13; strict adherence
to {%dharma%} is not to be expected in the Kali
Yuga-this is what Kṛṣṇa implied in his
words addressed to Balarāma to assuage his
wrath ({%prāptaṃ kaliyugaṃ viddhi%}) 9. 59.
21; in the Kali age (as in the Dvāpara) it
is necessary for people to he paired to beget
children ({%dvāpare maithuno dharmaḥ prajā-%}
{%nām abhavan nṛpa / tathā kaliyuge rājan%}
{%dvandvam āpedire janāḥ //%}) 12. 200. 37;
the ascetics born in the Kali age (as also in
the Tretā and the Dvāpara) are beset with
doubts ({%tretāyāṃ dvāpare caiva kalijāś ca%}
{%sasaṃśayāḥ / tapasvinaḥ%}) 12. 230. 7; evil
tribes like the Talavaras, the Andhrakas and
others which originate in the south ({%dakṣiṇā-%}
{%pathajanmānaḥ%}) and those like the Yaunas,
the Kāmbojas, and other which have their
origin in the north ({%uttarāpathajanmānaḥ%})
roam on the earth in the Tretā and the follow-
ing Yugas (i. e. also in the Kali) ({%tretā-%}
{%prabhṛti vartante te janā bharatarṣabha%})
12. 200. 39-42; Dyumatsena told Satyavān
that if the Dasyus were not killed then
[Page237-a+ 40]
in the Kaliyuga people would say to each
other: “this is mine, not his”, it would
then be difficult to carry on every day life
({%mamedam iti nāsyaitat pravarteta kalau%}
{%yuge / lokayātrā na caiva syāt%}) 12. 259. 6; if
one always recites the description of the origin
of cows he is freed of the impurity of the Kali
age (? or of evil spirit ?) ({%imaṃ gavāṃ pra-%}
{%bhavavidhānam uttamaṃ paṭhan sadā … %}
{%vimucyate kalikaluṣeṇa mānavaḥ%}) 13. 76. 32.
{@I.@} Span of life: In the Puṣya (i. e. the Kali)
Yuga there is no fixed span of life; people die
(even) in the womb or immediately after
they are born ({%na pramāṇasthitir hy asti%}
{%puṣye 'smin bharatarṣabha garbhasthāś ca%}
{%mriyante 'tra tathā jātā mriyanti ca //%})
6. 11. 7; the life-span, as also other faculties,
of human beings decrease successively in
each following Yuga ({%āyur vīryam … /%}
{%manusyāṇām anuyugaṃ hrasatīti nibodha%}
{%me //%}) 3. 188. 13; however, life is expected
to be of a hundred years ({% … tretādiṣv ete-%}
{%sāṃ pādaśo hrasate vayaḥ%}) 12. 224. 24, 25.
{@J.@} Kali as a name of Sūrya: Kali occurs
among the 108 names of Sūrya taught by
Dhaumya to Yudhiṣṭhira 3. 3. 22 (Nī. on
Bom. Ed. 3. 3. 20: {%kaliḥ sarvamalāśraya%}

Among the bad omens reported by Vyāsa to
Dhṛtarāṣṭra before the start of the great war
one was related to the night of the Kārttikī
full moon when the moon having the colour
of fire, shining in the sky of the same colour,

{@D.@} Religious importance: (1) Merit of a
person who visits Puṣkara on the Kārtikī
grows undecayingly 3. 80. 52; spending one
full moon Kārtikī night at Puṣkara was
equal to offering {%agnihotra%} for full hundred

of the Rākṣasas used to feed a thousand
excellent Brāhmaṇas on the autumnal full
moon day of the Kārttika; according to the
{%śruti%} texts Brāhmaṇas should be given preci-
ous stones ({%ratnāni%}) on that day; Virūpākṣa

Viṣṇu at the advent of the Kṛta Yuga and
are reabsorbed into him at the end of that
Yuga 13. 135. 11; (2) The creation of the
world, the creation of Saṃkarṣaṇa, Prad-
yumna, Aniruddha and Brahman, Nārāyaṇa's
incarnation as Varāha to reestablish the earth
and kill Hiraṇyākṣa, as Nṛsiṃha to kill
Hiraṇyakaśipu, and as Vāmana to make
Bali a resident of Pātāla—all these events

it to the Vālakhilyas ({% … purā kṛtayuge%}

{%dharma%} of the Ekāntins formed such an
important characteristic of the Kṛta Yuga
that if in any other Yuga the world became
full of the Ekāntins that would mean the
advent of the Kṛta Yuga—this is what
Vaiśaṃpāyana told Janamejaya ({%yady ekān-%}

12. 336. 27; this {%dharma%} was hence called
Kārtayugadharman 12. 336. 29; Brahmā, as
instructed by Nārāyaṇa, initiated first the
Kṛta Yuga and then the Sātvata {%dharma%}

In the fifth birth of Brahman from the nose
of Nārāyaṇa (12. 336. 36), at the beginning
of the Kṛtayuga, Prajāpati Vīraṇa learnt the
Sātvata Dharma from Sanatkumāra 12. 336.

of the Tretāyuga: Hanūmant told Bhīma
that the times in the Tretā were different from
those in the Kṛta ({%anyaḥ kṛtayuge kālas%}
{%tretāyāṃ dvāpare 'paraḥ%}) 3. 148. 6; Hanū-

(men are truthful ({%satyapravaṛttāś ca narāḥ%}),
they do not deviate from the path of {%dharma,%}
are given to the practice of austerities and to
giving gifts); the Tretāyuga also described
by Saṃjaya to Dhṛtarāṣṭra (Kṣatriyas are
long-lived, they are great warriors, excellent
archers in war, brave and emperors) 6. 11. 10
[Page250-a+ 40]
({%jāyante kṣatriyāḥ śūrās tretāyāṃ cakra-%}

condition of {%dharma%} in the Tretā is not
different from the one in the Kṛta described
by him ({%eṣa dharmaḥ kṛtayuge treāyām%})
3. 189 13; the ascetics in the Tretā, who
are steady in the {%sattva guṇa,%} have no
doubt whatever whether {%puruṣa, daiva%}
or {%svabhāva%} is the cause of a man's success
in his activities; they see no distinction,
as same people for want of judgement do,

and the life expectancy of the people in this
Yuga). {@J.@} Simile: The region where
the river Narmadā (f.) passes along the

to Yudhiṣṭhira 3. 3. 22. [The words Kṛta,
Tretā and Dvāpara occurring in 5. 140. 7-
15 are wrongly interpreted by Nī. (Bom.

yellow in the Dvāpara ({%dvāpare 'pi yuge … %}

king's behaviour, hence a king himself is
called Yuga ({%rājavṛttāni sarvāṇi rājaiva%}

a king ({%rājamūlāni sarvāṇi mama nāsty%}

Gaṅgā turns northwards near the abode (?)
of Maheśvara ({%maheśvarasya niṣṭhane%})
and by living there for a month, abstaining
from food, one sees the deities in person
({%svayaṃ paśyati devatāḥ%}) 13. 26. 14; by
going to the {%tīrtha%} Brahmaśiras, by bathing
({%kṛtodakaḥ%}) in the Bhāgīrathī and by
abstaining from food for a month one goes

his body, he thinks of the Gaṅgā he obtains
the best condition (after death) ({%sa gatiṃ%}

on the Gaṅgā: One who fasts near the river
for thirteen days and eats a part of the obla-
tion in the evening of the fourteenth day, and
he does this for twelve months, he gets the
fruit of a great sacrifice and he lives in the
company of the Devakanyās for a full year

death performed at the Gaṅgā: Those
beings whose bones ({%gātrāṇi;%} Nī. on

country through which the Gaṅgā flows is as
good as a penance grove; a place along the
river Gaṅgā is to be looked upon as the place
of the Siddhas ({%yatra gaṅgā mahārāja sa%}

is listed by Mārkaṇḍeya among rivers famous
as mothers of fire-hearths, i. e. sacrifices were
performed on their banks ({%gaṅgā ca … /etā%}

in the three worlds and achieved perfection
which was difficult to obtain 13. 27. 98-99;
[Page328-a+ 40]
(vi) The narration of the great importance
and virtues of the Gaṅgā is called a holy
Itihāsa containing the praise of the river; one
who recites it, or listens to it, is freed of all
sins ({%itihāsam imaṃ puṇyaṃ śṛṇuyād yaḥ%}
{%paṭheta vā / gaṅgāyāḥ stavasaṃyuktaṃ sa%}

96; (viii) Gaṅgā offered shelter, protection,
support to those who are without it 13. 27. 44;
Lomaśa invoked the blessings of the Gaṅgā,
besides those of Varuṇa, Yama, and the
Yamunā, on Yudhiṣṭhira and requested her
to protect him from the mountains which he
was about to enter while on his way to the
Gandhamādana 3. 140. 13-14; (ix) Grief
due to separation from the Gaṅgā more
unbearable than from near relatives or wealth;
on the other hand, just the sight of the Gaṅgā
is more pleasing than that of the desired
objects or sons 13. 27. 74-76; (x) Gaṅgā
offers sustenance to those who depend on her
13. 27. 51-52; (11) Relationship with other
rivers: (i) Tripathagā Gaṅgā looked upon as
the first to be created among the rivers ({%tathā%}
{%tripathagā gaṅgā nadīnām agrajā smṛtā%})
14. 44. 13; (ii) among the Vibhūtis of the
Bhagavān, Jāhnavī is said to be the best
among the rivers ({%srotasām asmi jāhnavī%})
6. 32. 31; also cf. 13. 27. 50; (iii) the Gaṅgā
has the same relationship to other rivers as
the sun has to other luminaries (?) in the sky,
the moon to the manes, and the king (?) to
men ({%divi jyotir yathādityaḥ pitṝṇāṃ caiva%}

to deities: Gaṅgā is mentioned among those
rivers who wait on Śiva for his ablutions
({%upasparśanahetos tvā samīpasthā upā-%}

of the rivers who wait upon Varuṇa in his
{%sabhā%} 2. 9. 17; (13) Limitation: Bhagī-
ratha told Brahmadeva that his stay even for
a hundred years on the bank of the Jāhnavī,
practising austerities and giving as gift a
thousand mules and a host of maidens ({%adāṃ%}
{%ca tatrāśvatarīsahasraṃ nārīpuram%}) was
not enough to take him to the Brahmaloka
which was beyond the world of the gods, the
cows and the sages 13. 106. 10, 5. {@E.@} Epic
events related to the Gaṅgā: (1) Marriage
with Saṃtanu and birth of Bhīṣma: King
Pratīpa once went to the bank of the Gaṅgā
({%gaṅgātīragataḥ%}) and sat down for many years
muttering prayers ({%japan%}) 1. 92. 1; Gaṅgā,
in the form of a beautiful woman, rose from
the waters and sat on the right thigh of king
Pratīpa 1. 92. 2-3; when asked by the king
what he might do to please her she requested
him to make love with her ({%tvām ahaṃ%}
{%kāmaye rājan kuruśreṣṭha bhajasva mām%})
1. 92. 4-5; but, at the king's suggestion,
she agreed to be his daughter-in-law and
disappeared 1. 92. 9-12, 15-16; she laid
down the condition that the king's son (her
future husband) should not know her identity
and should never question the propriety of her
actions ({%sa me nābhijanajñaḥ syād ācare-%}
{%yaṃ ca yad vibho / tat sarvam eva putras%}
{%te na mīmāṃseta karhicit%}) 1. 92. 13-14;
king Śāṃtanu, son of Pratīpa, once went for
hunting on the bank of the Gaṅgā; the river
appeared before him in the form of a beautiful
woman 1. 92. 25-26; when Śaṃtanu requested
her to be his wife she agreed on condition that
[Page329-a+ 40]
he did not prevent her from doing anything,
auspicious or otherwise ({%śubhaṃ vā yadi%}
{%vāśubham%}); should the king question her,
she would abandon him 1. 92. 31-35; when
the king consented, she, full of lustre, attended
on him as his wife 1. 92. 39-40; Gaṅgā, as
the wife of Śaṃtanu, gave birth to eight sons
seven of whom, as soon as they were born,
she threw away in the waters of the river
Gaṅgā; the king did not object to her on the
first seven occasions, but on the eighth occa-
sion he asked her to spare him a son; he
also wanted to know who she really was
1. 92. 44-47; when thus questioned, she told
Śaṃtanu that she was the river Gaṅgā, the
daughter of Jahnu, and that she lived with
him to achieve some purpose of the gods
({%devakāryārthasiddhyartham%} 1. 92. 49); the
eight sons she bore him were the eight Vasus
who were born as human beings due to the
curse of Vasiṣtha; she had promised the
Vasus that she would release them from their
human birth as soon as they were born
(cf. 1. 93. 40); she blessed the king before
her departure ({%svasti te 'stu gamiṣyāmi%}); she
told the king that she had lived with the Vasus
(while they were in her womb) in succession
({%eṣa paryāyavāso me vasūnāṃ saṃnidhau%}
{%kṛtaḥ%}) and that the eighth son who was to be
given to him later by her was the one born of
her (Gaṅgā) ({%matprasūtaṃ vijānīhi gaṅgā-%}
{%dattam imaṃ sutam%}) 1. 92. 48-55; Śaṃtanu
asked Jāhnavī who was Āpava (Vasiṣṭha)
and what fault the Vasus had committed to
invite the curse of Vasiṣṭha; he also asked
why the eighth son (Gaṅgādatta) was requir-
ed to live long among human beings 1. 9. 1-3;
Gaṅgā Jāhnavī then told the king the whole
story 1. 93. 5-42; Gaṅgā then disappeared
taking the last-born son with her 1. 93. 43;
[Page329-b+ 40]
many years later, King Śaṃtanu, while once
hunting along the river Gaṅgā Bhāgīrathī,
noticed that the river had little water ({%alpa-%}
{%jalām%} 1. 94. 21) and was not flowing as before
({%syandate kiṃ nv iyaṃ nādya%} 1. 94. 22);
trying to find out the cause of it the king
saw a young boy who had covered waters of
the entire Gaṅgā with his arrows 1. 94. 24-25;
Śaṃtanu suspected the boy to be his son and
hence asked Gaṅgā to show herself to him;
Gaṅgā appeared before the king holding the
boy in her right hand, but the king did not
immediately recognize her; Gaṅgā handed
over the son to the king 1. 94. 28-31, 36;
Śaṃtanu's marriage with Gaṅgā Bhāgīrathī
and the birth of Devavrata by her mentioned
in 1. 57. 76; 1. 90. 50; 5. 179. 5; 12. 38. 8;
12. 46. 15; the birth of the Vasus from Bhāgī-
rathī in the house of Śaṃtanu mentioned
in 1. 2. 78; 1. 61. 68; (2) Her role in
Bhīṣma's fight with Rāma Jāmadagnya:
When the fight between Bhīṣma and Rāma
Jāmadagnya was imminent, the latter threa-
tened to kill Bhīṣma so that Jāhnavī might
see him lying on the bed of arrows and the
daughter of Bhagīratha (Gaṅgā), who
gave birth to him, might weep seeing him
dead 5. 179. 3-5; when Bhīṣma was ready
to fight with Rāma, his mother appeared be-
fore him in her original form ({%svarūpiṇī%})
to try to dissuade Bhīṣma from the fight, and
expressed her readiness to go to Jāmadagnya
to beg him not to engage Bhīṣma, who was
his pupil, in fight; Bhīṣma then told her the
incidents which had led to the fight; then the
river (Gaṅgā) went to Rāma to dissuade
him; when told that it was Bhīṣma who was
to be dissuaded, Gaṅgā returned to Bhīṣma
and again pleaded with him; but Bhīṣma,
angered, did not agree to her request 5. 179.
[Page330-a+ 40]
22-30; Bhāgīrathī again appeared later in
this event when she joined the sages, Nārada
and others, who stood between Bhīṣma and
Rāma to stop them fighting with each other
5. 186. 27; (3) Her pleading with Ambā:
Gaṅgā, the mother of Bhīṣma, rose from the
waters and asked Ambā the purpose she
wanted to achieve by performing the auste-
rities; when told by Ambā that her effort was
aimed at the destruction of Bhīṣma, Gaṅgā
({%sāgaragā%}) told her that her purpose was
crooked ({%jihmaṃ carasi bhāmini%}); if she
persisted in observing her vows and if she
died during the observance of the vows she
would become a crooked river having water
only during the rainy season and not in the
remaining eight months ({%nadī bhaviṣyasi%}
{%śubhe kuṭilā vārṣikodakā / … vārṣikī nāṣṭa-%}
{%māsikī%}); Bhīsma's mother then returned from
the place where Ambā practised austerities
6. 187. 29-36; (4) Death of Bhīṣma: When
Bhīṣma, after his fall on the battle-field,
resolved to hold his life till the start of the
Uttarāyaṇa, Gaṅgā, knowing his resolve,
sent to him the great sages in the form of
swans 6. 114. 90; much later, after the
cremation of Bhīṣma, Dhṛtarāṣṭra and the
rest, including Vyāsa, Nārada, Asita and
Kṛṣṇa, went to the bank of the Bhāgīrathī
and all the Kṣatriya warriors and citizens
offered water offerings to him; then Bhāgīrathī
arose from water and, crying, lamented the
death of her son; she addressed her words to
the Kauravas praising and recounting the good
qualities of Bhīṣma 13. 154. 17-26; the
grieved Bhāgīrathī was consoled by Dāmo-
dara (Kṛṣṇa) assuring her that her son was
brought down from the chariot by Arjuna
and not by Śikhaṇḍin and that he had return-
ed to the Vasus in heaven 13. 154. 27-32;
[Page330-b+ 40]
Bhāgīrathī then gave up grief and entered
her own waters; Kṛṣṇa and others, after
honouring the river ({%satkṛtya te tāṃ saritam%})
returned from that place (to Hāstinapura)
when permitted by her to do so ({%anujñātās%}
{%tayā%}) 13. 154. 33-34; when Dhṛtarāṣṭra had
offered water offerings to Bhīṣma, Yudhiṣṭhira
came out of water with Dhṛtarāṣṭra and,
grief-stricken, fell on the bank of the Gaṅgā
14. 1. 1-2; (5) Arjuna punished for his role
in the fall of Bhīṣma: Ulūpī told Arjuna
that his defeat at the hands of his son Babhru-
vāhana was an expiation ({%niṣkṛtiḥ%}) he had
to undergo for the {%adharma%} committed by him
in bringing about the fall of Bhīṣma 14. 82. 8;
this expiation was prescribed by the Vasus
and the Gaṅgā ({%eṣā tu vihitā śāntiḥ putrād%}
{%yāṃ prāptavān asi /vasubhir vasudhāpāla%}
{%gaṅgayā ca mahāmate%}) 14. 82. 11; when
Bhīṣma died ({%hate śāntanave nṛpe%}) the
Vasus emerged from waters and meeting the
great river, told her that they wanted to
curse Arjuna for his misdeed in the war, to
which Bhāgīrathī agreed ({%idam ūcur vaco%}
{%ghoraṃ bhāgīrathyā mate tadā // … vayam%}
{%apy arjunaṃ … śāpena yojayāmeti tathāstv%}
{%iti cābravīt //%}) 14. 82. 12-15; (6) The
Pāṇḍavas came across the Gaṅgā at various
places: (i) When Yudhiṣṭhira and his bro-
thers decided to go on a pilgrimage, the
Brāhmaṇas expressed their wish to visit with
them the Gaṅgā and other rivers 3. 91. 10;
when they arrived at Prayāga at the con-
fluence of the Gaṅgā and the Yamunā the
Pāṇḍavas bathed in their waters ({%āplutya%}
{%gātrāṇi%}), practised the severest austerities
and gave gifts to the Brāhmaṇas 3. 93. 5-6;
(ii) They again arrived at the Bhāgīrathī
flowing by the side of the Agastyāśrama
where Lomaśa advised them to bathe at
[Page331-a+ 40]
will ({%yatheṣṭam avagāhyatām%}) 3. 97. 27;
(iii) Going further from the river Kauśikī,
they arrived at the place where the Gaṅgā
met the ocean and bathed there in waters
of five hundred rivers ({%nadīśatānāṃ pañcā-%}
{%nāṃ madhye cakre samāplavam%}) 3. 114. 2;
(iv) On reaching the vicinity of the Maināka
mountain, Lomaśa showed the river Gaṅgā
to Yudhiṣṭhira; he advised Yudhiṣṭhira to
bathe in the Gaṅgā to be freed of all sins;
he also advised him to bathe silently ({%tūṣṇīṃ%}
{%gaṅgām … samupaspṛśa%}) 3. 135. 5-7; (v)
When the Pāṇḍavas had crossed the Uśīra-
bīja, the Maināka, the Śvetagiri and the
Kālaśaila mountains, Lomaśa showed them
the Gaṅgā flowing in seven currents ({%eṣā%}
{%gaṅgā saptavidhā%}) 3. 140. 1-2; Lomaśa
could hear the sound of the Gaṅgā on the
top on the mountain Jāmbūnada 3. 140. 14;
(vi) The Pāṇḍavas saw the Bhāgīrathī on
the Kailāsa mountain; they lived there giving
offerings to gods and manes again and again
3. 145. 37, 40, 42; (7) Some events after
the war and the funeral rites offered to the
dead: (i) When Yudhiṣṭhira went to meet
Dhṛtarāṣṭra who had left Hāstinapura, he
saw the Kaurava women lamenting on the
bank of the Gaṅgā 11. 11. 5; (ii) Vyāsa,
who knew that Gāndhārī would curse the
Pāṇḍavas in their first meeting with her after
the war, hastened to them after bathing ({%upa-%}
{%spṛśya%}) in the Gaṅgā 11. 13. 4; (iii) After
lifting the funeral pyre of Droṇa, his pupils,
keeping Kṛpī in the front, proceeded to the
Gaṅgā 11. 23. 42; (iv) After arranging
for the cremation of all the heroes who fell
in the war, Yudhiṣṭhira, accompanied by
Dhṛtarāṣṭra, went towards the Gaṅgā 11.
26. 44; on reaching the Gaṅgā, Yudhiṣṭhira
and the Kaurava women offered water offerings
[Page331-b+ 40]
to the departed ({%pracakruḥ salilakriyāḥ%});
at that moment the Gaṅgā became easily
fordable spreading herself out widely ({%sūpa-%}
{%tīrthābhavad gaṅgā bhūyo viprasasāra ca%});
the bank of the Gaṅgā then was without
joy and merriment ({%nirānandam anutsavam%}
{% … gaṅgātīram aśobhata%}) 11. 27. 1-5; (v)
Yudhisṭhira, after giving water offerings to
Karṇa ({%cakārāsyodakaṃ prabhuḥ%} 11. 27.
21) and after performing the funeral rites for
him with the wives of Karṇa, came out of
the river Gaṅgā ({%sa tābhiḥ saha dharmātmā%}
{%pretakṛtyam anantaram kṛtvōttatāra gaṅgā-%}
{%yāḥ%}) 11. 27. 24; (vi) When the Pāṇḍavas,
who had given water offerings, were still
on the Bhāgīrathī, Dvaipāyana, Narada
and others and their pupils and hundreds
of thousands of other Brāhmaṇas gathered
there to console Yudhiṣṭhira 12. 1. 1-2,
4-5, 8; (8) Cremation of Pāṇḍu and
Mādrī: The cremation was performed on
an auspicious and even spot in the forest on
the river Gaṅgā ({%ramaṇīye vanoddeśe%}
{%gaṅgātīre same śubhe%}); the bier ({%śibikā%})
in which their dead bodies were brought from
Hāstinapura were placed on this spot 1. 118.
16-17; (9) Certain other epic events in
which the Gaṅgā is referred to: (i) At
Pramāṇakoṭi, Duryodhana tied up Bhīma,
while he was asleep, and threw him in the
waters of the Gaṅgā 1. 55. 10; 3. 13. 74;
(ii) Droṇa with his pupils once went to the
Gaṅgā for bathing when a crocodile caught
him by his ankle ({%jaṅghānte%}) 1. 123. 69;
(iii) When Drupada was brought captive by
his pupils to Droṇa, the latter told Drupada
that in future he (Drupada) would rule over
the Pañcāla country which lay to the south
of the Bhāgīrathī while he (Droṇa) himself
would rule over the part of the country which
[Page332-a+ 40]
lay to its north; Drupada then established
himself in the capital city of Kampilya in the
countryside of Mākandī on the river Gaṅgā
ruling the southern Pāñcālas as far as the
river Carmaṇvatī 1. 128. 12, 15; 1. 154. 24;
(iv) Drupada while reaming along the bank
of the Gāṅgā, came across a settlement of the
Brāhmaṇas ({%brāhmaṇāvasatha%}) 1. 155. 5;
(v) The Aṅgāraparṇa episode: The Pāṇḍa-
vas on their way to the Pañcālas reached the
Somaśravāyaṇa {%tīrtha%} on the river Gaṅgā;
Aṅgāraparṇa, king of the Gandharvas, had
already arrived there to sport with his wives
in the waters of the river Gaṅgā Bhāgīrathī;
he was angered when he heard the voice of
the Pāṇḍavas approaching the river; he told
the Pāṇḍavas to leave the place as the forest
along the rivers Gaṅgā and Vākā belonged
to him; Arjuna questioned the sole right of
the Gandharva over the river either at night,
or by day, or in twilight ({%nadyām asyām%}
{% … kasya kḷptaḥ parigrahaḥ%} 1. 158. 15);
it was therefore not proper for the Gan-
dharva to withhold the river from others
since that was against the age old custom
({%katham icchasi tāṃ roddhuṃ naiṣa dhar-%}
{%maḥ sanātanaḥ%} 1. 158. 20); why should the
Pāṇḍavas be restrained from touching the
waters of the Bhāgīrathī 1. 158. 2, 4, 5, 11,
13, 15, 20, 21; defeat of Aṅgāraparṇa in
this episode alluded to in 1. 2. 86; later the
Gandharva and the Pāṇḍavas took leave of
each other on the bank of the Bhāgīrathī
1. 174. 5; (vi) Arjuna, during the period
of his exile, entered the river Gaṅgā for
bathing; as he wanted to come out of the
water he was dragged by Ulūpī in the water
of that river 1. 206. 11-13; (vii) Arjuna,
during his exile, while going to the east,
crossed many rivers one of them being the
[Page332-b+ 40]
Gaṅgā 1. 207. 5-6; (viii) Kṛṣṇa, Bhīma
and Arjuna crossed the rivers Mālā, Carmaṇ-
vatī and Gaṅgā on their way to the Magadha
2. 18. 21; (ix) On account of the cries of
thousands of animals that were burnt at the
Khāṇḍava forest the fish in the waters (?)
of the Gaṅgā were terrified 1. 219. 28

The Pāṇḍavas spent their first night of forest
life under a banyan tree called Pramāṇa on
the river Jāhnavī; they bathed in it and had
only the water of the Jāhnavī to drink for
the night 3. 1. 39-40; from the bank of the
river Jāhnavī they started towards the Kuru-
kṣetra 3. 6. 1; (xi) On the mountain
Himavant Arjuna took bath in the Gaṅgā
before ascending Indra's chariot to go to the
Indraloka 3. 43. 20; (xii) Bhīṣma once
lived as a {%muni%} on the bank of the river
Bhāgīrathī practising the vow taken by his
father ({%pitryaṃ vratam%}); there he heard
from Pulastya the fruit obtained by visiting
the {%tīrthas%} 3. 80. 11-12; there, on the bank
of the Gaṅgā, he also heard the narrative of
Vipula from Mārkaṇḍeya 13. 43. 17; (xiii)
When the Pāṇḍavas were near the Gandha-
mādana mountain (3. 155. 34) Yudhiṣṭhira
showed to Bhīma the river Mahāgaṅgā 3.
155. 69, 85; (xiv) The basket ({%mañjūṣā%})
containing the newly born Karṇa went down
from the river Aśvanadī to the Gaṅgā (via
the Carmaṇvatī and the Yamunā) and then
to the city of Campā 3. 292. 25-26; when
the Sūta Adhiratha went with his wife to the
Jāhnavī, she saw there by chance the floating
basket brought to the bank by the waves of
the Jāhnavī 3. 293. 1, 3; (xv) The army of
the Kauravas, collected for the war, spread
[Page333-a+ 40]
along the bank of the Gaṅgā 5. 19. 30;
(xvi) Kuntī, who wished to approach Karṇa
to tell him the truth about his birth, went
to the Bhāgīrathī to meet him; there on the
bank of the Gaṅgā she heard the sound of
the prayers recited by Karṇa 5. 142. 26-27;
(xvii) Arjuna wishing to propitiate Śiva
to seek his help in fulfilling the vow to kill
Jayadratha saw the Gaṅgā on his way 7. 57.
24; (xviii) Bhīma, in search of Aśva-
tthāman, reached the bank of the Bhāgīrathī
where he saw Vyāsa and the other sages seated
on the bank ({%udakānte%}) 10. 13. 12-13;
(xix) After the great war, Kṛpa, Aśvatthā-
man and Kṛtavarman, after their meeting
with Dhṛtarāṣṭra, rode fast on horse-back to-
wards the Gaṅgā 11. 10. 19; (xx) Bhīṣma,
having narrated to Yudhiṣṭhira the Itihāsa
connected with the praise of the Gaṅgā
({%itihāsaṃ … gaṅgāyāḥ stavasaṃyutam%}), ad-
vised him to approach the Gaṅgā with great
devotion in order to obtain the highest per-
fection ({%siddhim uttamām%}); he and his
brothers were delighted to hear this Itihāsa
of the Gaṅgā from Bhīṣma 13. 27. 103-104;
(xxi) When Dhṛtarāṣṭra decided to retire to
the forest he, along with Gāndhārī, Kuntī,
Vidura and Saṃjaya, went in a day a long
distance from Hastinapura and camped on
the bank of the Bhāgīrathī; next morning
they started from there towards the north
15. 24. 16, 23; after going some distance they
again camped on the bank of the Bhāgīrathī;
in the evening he and Gāndhārī went to the
Gaṅgā and performed the prescribed puri-
ficatory rites ({%cakāra vidhivac chaucam%});
Vidura and other men performed individually
all the necessary rites ({%cakruḥ sarvāḥ kriyās%}
{%tatra puruṣā vidurādayaḥ%}) after bathing in
the various {%tīrthas (tīrtheṣv āplutya);%} when
[Page333-b+ 40]
the purificatory rites were over Kuntī led
Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Gāndhārī to the bank of the
Gaṅgā; there the priests of the king laid a
Vedī ({%kṛto vedīparistaraḥ%}) on which Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra gave offerings in the fire; from the
bank of the Bhāgīrathī they all proceeded to
the Kurukṣetra 15. 25. 1, 4-8; (10) Meet-
ing with the dead: Vyāsa asked Dhṛtarāṣṭra
and all those staying with him to go to the
bank of the Bhāgīrathī to meet all those
who fell in the war; accordingly all of them
went to the Gaṅgā and resided there 15. 39.
18-22; then in the evening Vyāsa bathed in
the Bhāgīrathī and invoked all those who
fought on the side of the Pāṇḍavas and the
Kauravas; at his call, all the kings, Bhīṣma,
Droṇa, and the rest, together with their armies,
rose in thousands from the water (of the
Bhāgīrathī) 15. 40. 4, 7, 13; after some time,
at the instance of Vyāsa, they again dis-
appeared plunging into the river Tripathagā
(Gaṅgā) and repaired to their respective
places; then Vyāsa, standing in the water
(of the Tripathagā), told the Kaurava women
that those who wished to obtain the worlds
of their respective deceased husbands should
quickly enter the water of the Jāhnavī; the
women, fully believing the words of Vyāsa,
took permission of Dhṛtarāṣṭra and entered
the water of the Jāhnavī; freed of their bodies
they were united with their husbands and
acquired the worlds of their husbands 15.
41. 13, 17-21; (11) End of Dhṛtarāṣṭra,
Gāndhārī and Kuntī: When Nārada arrived
at Hāstinapura to meet Yudhiṣṭhira he paid
a visit to the Gaṅgā on his way; people
residing near the Gaṅgā had told Yudhi-
ṣṭhira that Dhṛtarāṣṭra was engaged in
severe austerities; Yudhiṣṭhira therefore
asked Nārada if he had met Dhṛtarāṣṭra
[Page334-a+ 40]
and the rest during his visit to the Gaṅgā
and how they fared; Nārada told him that
after their last meeting with Dhṛtarāṣṭra the
latter had repaired to the Gaṅgādvāra; once,
after his bath in the Gaṅgā, when Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra had started for his hermitage, wind
arose, fire engulfed the forest, and burnt it
({%gaṅgāyām āpluto dhīmān āśṛamābhimukho%}
{%'bhavat%} 15. 45. 18); Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Gāndhārī
and Kuntī were burnt in the fire; only Saṃ-
jaya escaped from the forest fire and was
seen, surrounded by ascetics, by Nārada
on the bank of the Gaṅgā 15. 45. 5-6, 10,
29-32; Nārada further informed Yudhiṣṭhira
that Dhṛtarāṣṭra was burnt on the bank of
the Jāhnavī not by the ordinary fire but by
the sacred fire which Dhṛtarāṣṭra himself
and his priests had left after performing the
rites (i. e. the forest fire was caused by the
sacred fire left by Dhṛtarāṣṭra) ({%nāsau vṛthā-%}
{%gninā dagdho yathā tatra śrutaṃ mayā%});
this was reported to Nārada by the sages
whom he met on the bank of the Bhāgīrathī
15. 47. 1-6; when asked by Nārada to give
the water offerings to Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Gāndhārī
and Kuntī ({%kartum arhasi kaunteya teṣāṃ%}
{%tvam udakakriyām%}), Yudhiṣṭhira went to the
Gaṅgā with his brothers and wife; there,
going into the water, they all offered water
({%dadus toyam%}) and stayed outside the city
to undergo purification ({%śaucaṃ nivartaya-%}
{%ntaḥ%}) 15. 47. 9-13; (12) Ulūpī entered the
Gaṅgā when, at the end, the Pāṇḍavas and
Draupadī started for the forest 17. 1. 25;
{@F.@} Past and mythological events in which
the river Gaṅgā figures: (1) Past events:
(i) Bhagīratha brought her down from the
heaven: The sage Kapila had told Aṃśu-
mant, the grandson of Sagara, that his
grandson will bring down the Tripathagā
[Page334-b+ 40]
from the heaven by propitiating Maheśvara
for the purification of the burnt sons of
Sagara 3. 107. 27; however, the descent of
the Gaṅgā from the heaven was first attem-
pted by Dilīpa, father of Bhagīratha, with-
out success 3. 106. 38; Bhagīratha, desirous
of seeking the favour of the Gaṅgā, went
to the Himavant to practise austerities 3.
107. 4; after one thousand years the Gaṅgā
appeared before Bhagīratha in a bodily form
3. 107. 14; when requested by Bhagīratha to
wash the bones ({%śarīrāṇi%}) of the sons of
Sagara so that they might go to heaven,
she agreed, but first asked Bhagīratha to
propitiate Śiva by {%tapas%} so that he might
agree to hold her on his head; no one else
could check her speed when she descended from
heaven; Bhagīratha succeeded in securing a
boon from Śaṅkara to hold the Gaṅgā 3.
107. 18-25; Śiva assured Bhagīratha to
hold the Devanadī (Gaṅgā) when she came
down from heaven; Śiva then went to the
Himavant and asked Bhagīratha to request
the daughter of the king of the mountains
(Gaṅgā not directly named) to come down
from the heaven; when Bhagīratha thought
of the Gaṅgā ({%gaṅgāṃ samanucintayat%}
3. 108. 5), the river descended from heaven
on Śiva's forehead; the river became triple
while flowing thence to the ocean ({%sā ba-%}
{%bhūva visarpantī tridhā rājan samudragā%}
3. 108. 10); the river asked Bhagīratha to
show her the way; Bhagīratha led her to the
place where lay the bones ({%śarīṛāṇi%}) of the
sons of Sagara; after holding the Gaṅgā on
his head Hara went to the Kailāsa; Bhagī-
ratha having reached the ocean with the
Gaṅgā filled it with the water of the river;
Bhagīratha made Gaṅgā his daughter ({%duhi-%}
{%tṛtve ca nṛpatir gaṅgāṃ samanukalpayat%});
[Page335-a+ 40]
he offered water of the Gaṅgā to the manes
3. 108. 17; 12. 29. 62; Lomaśa thus told
Yudhiṣṭhira how the Gaṅgā came to be Tri-
pathagā (flowing in three regions-heaven,
mid-region, and the earth) and how she was
made to descend also to fill the ocean with
water ({%pūraṇārthaṃ samudrasya pṛthivīm%}
{%avatāritā%}) 3. 108. 2-18; the incident of the
descent of the Gaṅgā on the head of Śiva also
alluded to in 5. 109. 6; 6. 7. 28; 13. 27. 71, 87,
89, 95; 13. 106. 26; 13. 134. 17; (ii) Other
events related to Bhagīratha and the Gaṅgā:
(a) Gaṅgā Bhāgīrathī formerly sat on the
lap of Bhagīratha while he was seated on the
slope (near the river), hence she came to
be known as Urvaśī ({%upahvare nivasato%}
{%yasyāṅke niṣasāda ha / gaṅgā bhāgīṛathī%}
{%tasmād urvaśī hy abhavat purā%} 12. 29. 61

saras Bhagīratha watched Bhāgīrathī Gaṅgā
and lived there for many years 2. 3. 9; 6.
7. 41; (c) Bhagīratha gave on the Gaṅgā
a myriad of hundreds of cows ({%gavāṃ%}
{%śatānām ayutam%}) 13. 106. 37; he gave
gifts (of cows ?) which would cover the
entire current of the Gaṅgā ({%srotaś ca%}
{%yāvad gaṅgāyāś channam āsīj jagatpate /%}
{%dakṣiṇābhiḥ pravṛttābhiḥ%}) 13. 106. 24;
(iii) Jahnu and the Gaṅgā: The Gaṅgā
became the daughter of Jahnu ({%duhitṛtvam%}
{%anuprāptā gaṅgā yasya%} (i. e. {%jahnoḥ%}))
13. 4. 3; Jahnu waited on her ({%jahnur%}
{%jāhnavisevitā%}) 13. 151. 44; (iv) King
Yayāti, desirous of arranging a Svayaṃvara
for his daughter Mādhavī, went to a hermitage
situated on the confluence of the Gaṅgā and
the Yamunā; his sons Pūru and Yadu put
[Page335-b+ 40]
their sister on a chariot and rushed to the
same hermitage 5. 118. 1-2; the entire region
between the Gaṅgā and the Yamunā in the
middle of the earth was given by Yayāti to
his son Pūru as his kingdom ({%gaṅgāyamu-%}
{%nayor madhye kṛtsno 'yaṃ viṣiyas tava /%}
{%madhye pṛthivyās tvaṃ rājā%}) 1. 82. 5;
(v) A battle was fought between Haryaśva
and the Haihayas, the kinsmen of Vītahavya,
in the region lying between the Gaṅgā and
the Yamunā; in this battle Haryaśva was
killed 13. 31. 11; Divodāsa, son of Sudeva,
established Vārāṇasī on the north bank of the
Gaṅgā and to the south of Gomatī (to avoid
the attack by the Haihayas) 13. 31. 18, 16;
when, later, Pratardana, the son of Divodāsa,
wanted to attack the Vaitahavyas (= Hai-
hayas) he crossed the river Gaṅgā 13. 31. 35;
(vi) On the river Gaṅgā, near Kanyakubja,
king Gādhi married his daughter Satyavatī to
Ṛcīka Bhārgava 3. 115. 17; (vii) The sage
Cyavana Bhārgava once took the vow of
staying in water for twelve years ({%udavāsa-%}
{%kṛtārambho babhūva sumahāvrataḥ … var-%}
{%ṣāṇi dvādaśa munir jalavāse dhṛtavrataḥ%})
13. 50. 3-4; he became stiff like a post
({%sthāṇubhūtaḥ%}) and after worshipping the
deities entered the waters of the Gaṅgā and
the Yamunā; he withstood with his head the
terrific current of the two rivers; the two
rivers, and those which followed them, made
a {%pradakṣiṇā%} of the sage and did not cause
harm to him; the sage slept in the waters like
a log of wood and then stood erect ({%antar%}
{%jale sa suṣvāpa kāṣṭhabhūto mahāmuniḥ /%}
{%tataś cordhvasthito dhīmān abhavad bhara-%}
{%tarṣabha%}) 13. 50. 6-9; (viii) Sage Cyavana
took his residence for some time on the bank of
the river Gaṅgā to observe a {%vrata%} 13. 53. 55;
(ix) At a place not far from Kanyakubja
[Page336-a+ 40]
on the bank of the Gaṅgā is the Aśvatīrtha
where from the waters of the Gaṅgā arose
a thousand horses having one black ear;
Ṛcīka, the son of Cyavana, got them by
the favour of Varuṇa 13. 4. 16-17; (x)
A certain Brāhmaṇa once lived in the city
Mahāpadma on the southern bank of the
Gaṅgā 12. 341. 1; (xi) When Śuka was
born on the mountain Meru ({%merupṛṣṭhe%}),
Gaṅgā in her original form ({%svarūpiṇī%})
arrived there to bathe him 12. 311. 12;
(xii) Once, Suvarṇaṣṭhīvin, the young son
of Sṛñjaya, accompanied by his nurse, ran
while playing on the bank of the Bhāgīrathī;
he was then attacked by Indra's {%vajra%} in
the form of a tiger 12. 31. 31; (xiii) Gau-
tama and his brothers put their eldest brother
Dīrghatamas in a wooden box and put it on
the Gaṅgā; king Bali, who had gone to bathe
in the river Gaṅgā (not named), saw the box
brought to him by the current of the water
1. 98. 18, 21; (xiv) When the Kṣatriyas
were destroyed by Rāma Jāmadagnya, Aṅga,
the son of Diviratha, was protected by Gau-
tama on the bank of the Gaṅgā 12. 49. 72;
(xv) Bharata, the son of Duḥṣanta, offered
on different rivers a thousand horse-sacrifices
of which he bound fourteen horses on the river
Gaṅgā ({%yo baddhvā … aśvān devebhyo … %}
{%gaṅgām anu caturdaśa // aśvamedhasaha-%}
{%sreṇa … iṣṭavān sa mahātejā dauḥṣantir%}
{%bharataḥ purā //%}) 12. 29. 41-42; (xvi)
Bharadvāja, when he went to the Gaṅgā for
bath, saw there the Apsaras Ghṛtācī who
had also come there to bathe 1. 154. 2;
(xvii) Vasiṣṭha turned the Gaṅgā, proceed-
ing towards the Kailāsa, to the Mānasa lake;
when that lake got mixed with the river,
the Gaṅgā became the Sarayū 13. 140. 23-24;
(xviii) Rājadharman, the son of Kaśyapa
[Page336-b+ 40]
and Dākṣāyaṇī, offered to Gautama, his guest,
large fishes ({%mahāmīnāḥ%}) obtained from the
regions through which the river Gaṅgā flew
12. 164. 4; (xix) A certain Brāhmaṇa,
Kauśika by name, told the truth to the robbers
about the whereabouts of the people who
were afraid of them; by this act he incurred
sin on the river Gaṅgā 12. 110. 8 (reference
to 8. 49. 41-46 where in st. 32 Gaṅgā is
not named); (xx) The following persons
attained perfection ({%siddhi%}) on the Gaṅgā:
(1) Śilavṛtti, when instructed by Siddha on
the virtues of the Tripathā, worshipped the
Gaṅgā according to the rites and attained
perfection which was very difficult to attain;
Siddha himself, after instructing Śilarati,
entered the sky 13. 27. 101-102; (2) Sage
Sanatkumāra attained great perfection on the
Gaṅgā 3. 135. 6; (xxi) Indra, in the form
of a very weak Brāhmaṇa, appeared before
Yavakrī and started doing an impossible
deed viz. constructing a dam in the Bhāgī-
rathī by filling the Gaṅgā with sand; he
poured constantly handfuls of sand in the
Bhāgīrathī; when asked by Yavakrī smilingly
why he was busy with this fruitless effort
Indra told him that he wanted to construct
a dam in the Gaṅgā so that the river can be
crossed easily 3. 135. 30-36; (2) Mytho-
logical: (i) Gaṅgā once went to pay a
visit to Pitāmaha (Brahmadeva) in his as-
sembly; there her garment was displaced by
the wind; King Mahābhiṣa, who happened to
be there, constantly looked at her in that
condition; he was therefore cursed to be born
again as a human being; Gaṅgā returned
from the assembly continuing to think about
Mahābhīṣa; she saw the Vasus, dejected,
going along the way; she asked them the
cause of their dejection; the Vasus told her
[Page337-a+ 40]
that they were cursed by Vasiṣṭha to be born
as humans; they requested Gaṅgā to assume
a human form so that she could give birth
to them as humans; Gaṅgā agreed and asked
them whom would they like to be their father;
they chose Śaṃtanu, the son of Pratīpa;
Gaṅgā also had thought of the same person,
hence she would do what was dear to the king
and to the Vasus; Vasus requested Gaṅgā to
throw them into water no sooner they were
born; Gaṅgā agreed to even that request,
but asked them to spare one of them so that
Śaṃtanu's union with her would not be totally
fruitless; Vasus consented to do that, each
one of them contributing one-eighth share for
Gaṅgā's son; and they also told her that the
son of the Gaṅgā would beget no son; having
come to this agreement with the Gaṅgā
the Vasus, delighted, went their way 1. 91.
4-22; (ii) The lustre ({%tejaḥ%} 13. 84. 11)
of Rudra fell in Agni; Agni was to beget
through that lustre a son on the Gaṅgā for
killing the enemy of the gods; Agni went
to the Gaṅgā Bhāgīrathī and became mixed
with her; as a result, Gaṅgā became pregnant;
Gaṅgā could not bear the embryo, was men-
tally distressed, and was in great agony;
when Agni laid the lustrous embryo in the
Gaṅgā, an Asura (not named) roared fiercely;
terrified, the Gaṅgā was unable to bear the
embryo; Jāhnavī, with her body covered with
lustre and trembling, told Agni that she could
not contain his lustre within her; she was
very much uneasy and was agitated; she
would like to cast away the embryo, as she
could hold it no longer, and not because of
her sweet will; she was no longer her usual
self; Agni, however, asked her to contain the
embryo within her: as she was capable of
bearing and containing the whole earth there
[Page337-b+ 40]
was nothing which Gaṅgā could not achieve
except (perhaps) containing the seed of Agni;
in spite of the entreaties of Vahni and the
other gods the Gaṅgā cast off the embryo on
mount Meru; Gaṅgā was capable of holding
an embryo, but she could not do it on this
occasion as she was overcome by the lustre
of Rudra; when she cast it off, she appeared
before Agni who asked her if the delivery
was happy ({%kaccid garbhaḥ sukhodayaḥ%});
he asked her to describe to him the colour,
the form and the lustre of the child; having
described to Agni the form of his son the god-
dess ({%devī%}) Gaṅgā disappeared 13. 84. 8, 12,
52-72; 9. 43 8-9 (where the embryo is said
to have been cast off on the mountain Hima-
vant; when the embryo was cast off that part
of the mountain became of gold 9. 43. 14);
the son Kumāra was first Gāṅgeya (son of
Gaṅgā), then became Kārttikeya (the son of
the Kṛttikās); the Gaṅgā, the best among the
rivers, waited on him 9. 43. 20; when the
child approached Śiva, Pārvatī, Gaṅgā and
Pāvaka (Agni) each one of them wondered
whom he would show his honour by going to
him or her first ({%kiṃ nu pūrvam ayaṃ%}
{%bālo gauravād abhyupaiṣyati /api mām iti%}
{%sarveṣām teṣām āsīd manogatam%}) 9. 43.
34-35; knowing their mind the child assumed
four forms ({%tato 'bhavac caturmūrtiḥ%}), of
which the form Naigameṣa went to the Gaṅgā
9. 43. 37, 39; then all the four, Rudra, Devī,
Pāvaka and the Gaṅgā, bowed down to Pitā-
maha (Brahmadeva) and requested him to
grant Kumāra the overlordship of all beings
i. e. of the kings of all the classes of gods
({%ādhipatyam; senāpatyam dadau tasmai%}
{%sarvabhūteṣu bhārata / sarvadevanikāyānāṃ%}

{%deśāsmai sarvabhūtapitāmahaḥ%}) 9. 43. 42,
[Page338-a+ 40]
44, 48, 49; when the gods gave different gifts
to Kumāra, Gaṅgā gave him a divine water
vessel which was the source of the nectar
({%kamaṇḍaluṃ divyam amṛtodbhavam utta-%}
{%mam%}) 9. 45. 45; people call Kumāra diffe-
rently the son of Pitamaha, or of Maheśvara,
or of Umā, or of the Kṛttikās, or of the
Gaṅgā 9. 45. 86; the incident is also allud-
ed to in 3. 207. 4; 13. 27. 87 ({%iyaṃ gāṅgā%}
{% … guhasya rukmasya ca garbhayoṣā;%} Nī.
on Bom. Ed. 13. 26. 88: {%garbhayoṣā garbha-%}
{%dhāriṇī strī%}); (iii) Once when the gods
performed a {%satra%} in the Naiṃiṣa forest (3.
189. 1), they saw a (golden) lotus coming
floating on the river Bhāgīrathī; to find out
its source, Indra went to the place of the
origin of the Gaṅgā ({%yatra gaṅgā satataṃ%}
{%saṃprasūtā%}); he saw there a woman weeping
while standing in the water of the river; the
tear which fell in the water became a golden
lotus 1. 189. 10-11; (iv) When, in former
times, Pitāmaha (Brahmadeva) once per-
formed a sacrifice on the Mahendra mountain,
Bhāgīrathī was present in the {%sadas (yatra%}

the demon Kirmīra in the Kāmyaka forest,
the Pāṇḍavas proceeded towards the Dvaita-
vana 3. 12. 18; (2) The Pāṇḍavas wishing
[Page367-b+ 40]
to settle down for their forest life near the lake
Dvaitavana, entered the forest Dvaitavana
3. 25. 13, 16; (3) In the Dvaitavana (not
named) the Pāṇḍavas sported in the auspici-
ous woods of the Śāla trees along the river
Sarasvatī; there Yudhiṣṭhira satisfied the
twice-borns by offering them large-sized roots
and fruit; there Dhaumya officiated for their
religious rites to gods and manes; sage
Mārkaṇḍeya arrived there as a guest of the
Pāṇḍavas 3. 26. 1-4; (4) When the Pāṇḍa-
vas lived in the Dvaitavana, the forest
was full of Brāhmaṇas; the forest resounded
with the sound of Vedic recitations of the
Brāhmaṇas and the sound of the bow-strings
of the Pāṇḍavas; thus the Kṣatriya valour,
united with Brahmanic lustre, shone all the
more in the forest ({%saṃsṛṣṭaṃ brahmaṇā%}
{%kṣatraṃ bhūya eva vyarocata%}); Baka Dāl-
bhya pointed out to Yudhiṣṭhira Bhṛgus and

leave the Dvaitavana since staying long at
one place was not desirable; hence he went
from the Dvaita to the Kāmyaka forest 3.
37. 31-32, 37; (6) Later when the
Pāṇḍavas returned to the Dvaitavana from
the Gandhamādana, the ascetics in the forest
returned to them 3. 174. 22; (7) Karṇa
suggested to Duryodhana to visit the lake
Dvaitavana to show the pomp of the Kauravas
to the Pāṇḍavas 3. 226. 12-13; Duryodhana
approved of this idea; his only purpose was
to oust the Pāṇḍavas from the forest ({%na%}

[Page368-a+ 40]
227. 5, 8-11; Karṇa suggested that their
pretext to visit the Dvaitavana should be to
meet the cowherds who awaited Duryodhana's

Yudhiṣṭhira reminded the Kauravas through
Saṃjaya of their defeat at the hands of the
Gandharvas in the Dvaitavana, where they
had arrived for the Ghoṣayātrā, and their
subsequent release from the captivity of
their adversaries by Bhīmasena and Arjuna
5. 23. 25; Śalya later alleged that in that
encounter with the Gandharvas Karṇa was
the first to run away from the battle
8. 28. 59; (9) After the Ghoṣayātrā
incident the Pāṇḍavas lived happily in the
Dvaitavana forest 3. 235. 25; (10)
Duḥśāsana sent a messenger to the Pāṇḍavas
and the Brāhmaṇas living in the Dvaitavana
to invite them to attend Duryodhana's
Vaiṣṇava Yajña 3. 242. 7; (11) Yudhi-
ṣṭhira, disturbed by Karṇa's vow to kill
Arjuna, thought of leaving the Dvaita-
vana 3. 243. 21; (12) While living in the
Dvaitavana, Yudhiṣṭhira once saw deer in a
dream who requested him to leave the forest
and go elsewhere as, on account of their pre-
sence, only a few deer were left in that forest
3. 244. 2, 5; (13) At the end of the
twelfth year of their forest life the Pāṇḍavas
went from the Kāmyaka to the Mārkaṇḍeyā-
śrama in the Dvaitavana 3. 294. 43; 3. 295.
3; (14) During their stay in the Dvaita-
vana the Pāṇḍavas, while once braving for the
sake of a Brāhmaṇa ({%brāhmaṇārthe parā-%}

however, ended happily 17. 3. 18-19; 18. 3.

Yudhiṣṭhira was tested by Dharma in that
[Page368-b+ 40]
episode which took place in the Dvaitavana
3. 295. 7-3. 298. 25); (15) Yudhiṣṭhira,
at the end of the twelfth year, while dismiss-
ing those who stayed with him in the forest,
asked them to tell people that they did not
know where the Pāṇḍavas went after they
(the Pāṇḍavas) left them in the Dvaitavana
4. 4. 5; (16) In the Dvaitavana Arjuna
used to praise the heroic qualities of Sātyaki
for Yudhiṣṭhira 7. 85. 61; (17) Yudhiṣṭhira,
humiliated by Karṇa, blamed Arjuna for not
killing Karṇa and told Arjuna that he should
have admitted to the Pāṇḍavas in the
Dvaitavana itself that he would not be able
to stand up to Karṇa in the war 8. 48. 2;
(18) Yudhiṣṭhira was dejected at the thought
of the destruction in the war and was think-
ing of retiring to forest; Draupadī then
reminded him of his resolve to kill
Duryodhana and rule the earth which he had
announced to his brothers in the Dvaitavana
12. 14. 8; (19) In the Dvaitavana,
Balarāma met the sages, bathed in Dvaitavana

The gods, the Daityas, and the Brahmani-

Janamejaya to visit the Puṣkara; such

(12) Parāśara told Janaka that more than
bathing in the water of Puṣkara one should

{%gāś ca sahasraśaḥ%}); but that was not
enough to enable one to reach the Brahma-
loka—this is what Bhagīratha told Brahman
13. 106. 11; (ii) Sprinkling one's body with
the water of the Puṣkara is not necessary for
one who listens to the Bhārata ({%yo bhārataṃ%}

the two met at Prabhāsa; they sported there
according to their wishes and from there they
went to the Raivataka mountain 1. 210. 2-4,
8; (2) The Brāhmaṇas wished to visit the
Prabhāsa and the other {%tīrthas%} along with
Yudhiṣṭhira 3. 91. 10; (3) After visiting
Śūrpāraka, Yudhiṣṭhira went to Prabhāsa;
he bathed there and, with his brothers and
Kṛṣṇā, gave offerings to gods and manes;
the Brāhmaṇas and Lomaśa too offered there
to gods and manes; Yudhiṣṭhira practised
there severe austerities 3. 118. 15-17; (4)
Balarāma and Janārdana, along with the
Vṛṣṇi heroes, went to Prabhāsa to meet the
Pāṇḍavas; the Pāṇḍavas and the Vṛṣṇis held
consultations together at Prabhāsa 3. 118.
18; 3. 119. 1-3; (5) Arjuna, in his wander-
ings with the sacrificial horse, came to
Prabhāsa from Gokarṇa 14. 84. 12; (6)
[Page389-a+ 40]
Balarāma, in his {%tīrthayātrā,%} first went to
Prabhāsa 9. 34. 36; (7) The Yādavas,
desirous of visiting a {%tīrtha,%} went to
Prabhāsa and lived there; there they were
engaged in a drinking bout ({%prāvartata%}

ing that followed the Vṛṣṇi heroes, the Bhojas
and the Andhakas were all destroyed at
Prabhāsa 16. 9. 8-9. {@E.@} Past and my-
thological events: (1) At Prabhāsa Kṛṣṇa,
observing restraint ({%niyame sthitaḥ%}) stood
on one foot for a thousand divine years
({%divyaṃ varṣasahasrakam%}) to practise aus-
terities 3. 13. 14; (2) The sages Śukra,
Aṅgiras and others who came together at
Prabhāsa thought of going on a {%tīrthayātrā%}
from there; (3) Soma was cursed by
Dakṣa; as a result he was emaciated and could
not shine; Dakṣa Prajāpati advised him to
go to the {%tīrtha%} of Sarasvatī (i. e. Prabhāsa)
and emerge from there after taking a bath;
when Soma did this he could wax again; but
for one half of the month he would wane;
so Soma went to Prabhāsa and emerged
after bath on the new moon day; he could
illuminate the worlds; the gods then reached
Prabhāsa and, in the company of Soma,
met Dakṣa; this is why Prabhāsa became
the most excellent of all the {%tīrthas (pra-%}
{%bhāsaṃ ca yathā tīrthaṃ tīrthānāṃ pra-%}
{%varaṃ hy abhūt);%} on every new moon day
the moon bathes in Prabhāsa and waxes
again; that is why Prabhāsa is so called
9. 34. 67-77; 9. 34. 36-39; (the bath in
the Hiraṇyasaras {%tīrtha,%} which later became
known as Prabhāsa, was prescribed for Soma
by the sages 12. 329. 46). {@F.@} Holiness:
(1) If one who is pure and has a controll-
ed mind ({%śuciḥ prayatamānasaḥ%}) bathes at
Prabhāsa he secures for himself the fruit of
[Page389-b+ 40]
an Agniṣṭoma and an Atirātra sacrifice 3.
80. 78; (2) According to Aṅgiras one
who bathes in Prabhāsa is awakened in a
{%vimāna%} by the praises of Apsarases 13.
26. 9; (3) According to Aṅgiras, again,
one who with concentrated mind ({%samāhitaḥ%})
spends one night of the new moon day
({%amāvāsyām%}) at Prabhāsa has (as though)
a second birth as a Siddha ({%siddhyate 'tra%}
{%mahābāho yo naro jāyate punaḥ%}) 13. 26.
51; (4) According to a Gāthā sung by
Yayāti one who visits Prabhāsa lives long
again in this life ({%labdhāyur jīvite punaḥ%})
12. 148. 11; (5) If the high-souled persons,
observing vows, visit Prabhāsa they become
auspicious, obtain divine forms, wear divine
garlands, and full of divine fragrance they
reach the world of cows ({%? gavāṃ vimāne%})

when Śuka moved through the sky he saw
before him the two summits of Meru and
Himavant closely connected with each other;
undeterred Śuka went on flying and suddenly
the two peaks split into two; that was a
marvel; Śuka passed beyond the two peaks
and the mountain (Meru or Himavant ?)

angered, began to grow and obstructed the
path of the sun and the moon; the gods tried to
stop him from growing but Vindhya did not
stop; the gods then approached Agastya and
told him that Vindhya, under the influence of
anger, was covering the path of the luminaries;
they added that no one else except the sage was
able to dissuade the mountain; hearing that

Agastya, in the company of his wife, appro-

to go to the south on some purpose; he asked
the mountain to wait for his return and grow
again as desired after he returned; Agastya
made this contract with Vindhya but never re-
turned from the south; Vindhya was thus made
to stop growing due to the power of Agastya

to displace Vasiṣṭha with the help of severe
austerities ({%vasiṣṭhaṃ cālayām āsa tapa-%}

Sarasvatī to bring Vasiṣṭha to him swiftly
so that he could kill him (Vasiṣṭha); Viśvā-
mitra therefore thought of Sarasvatī; she
appeared before him, trembling with fear, and
asked him what she might do for him; Viśvā-
mitra told the river what he wanted her to do;
hearing that Sarasvatī was pained; she just
stood there all the while shaking with fear;
Viśvāmitra asked her again to bring Vasiṣṭha
quickly to him; she was worried what
to do as she was afraid of the curses
of both the sages; she went to Vasiṣṭha
and informed him what Viśvāmitra's desire
was; Vasiṣṭha saw her pale and lean and
told her to carry him to Viśvāmitra and save
herself from the latter's curse; hearing that
Sarasvatī reflected on what she might
do which would turn out beneficial to
Vasiṣṭha as he had been merciful to her;
when she saw on the other bank Viśvāmitra
engaged in giving offerings she thought that
to be the right moment to act swiftly ({%saras-%}
{%vaty abhyacintayat / idam antaram ity eva%}
9. 41. 26-27); she washed away a part of
[Page474-a+ 40]
her bank on the side of Vasiṣṭha so that he
was carried on her current to the {%āśrama%} of
Viśvāmitra; while he was being thus carried
Vasiṣṭha praised Sarasvatī (Sarasvatī's praise
9. 41. 29-31); Sarasvatī informed Viśvāmitra
that she had brought Vasiṣṭha; Viśvāmitra
began to look for a weapon to kill Vasiṣṭha;
being afraid of the sin of killing a Brāhmaṇa
Sarasvatī carried Vasiṣṭha back to the eastern
bank ({%brahmahatyābhayān nadī / apovāha%}
{%vasiṣṭhaṃ tu prācīṃ diśam atandritā%} 9. 41.
34); she thus did what both the sages asked
her to do, but Viśvāmitra was deceived;
enraged, he cursed the river to flow with
blood; as a result Sarasvatī flew with water
mixed with blood for a year; the sages, gods,
Gandharvas and Apsarases were excessively
pained to see Sarasvatī in that condition; this
is how the {%tīrtha%} Vasiṣṭhāpavāha came into
existance 9. 41. 11-39; when Sarasvatī
carried blood with water in her current,
Rākṣasas came there and were happy to drink
blood from the river water; once, some sages,
while visiting the {%tīrthas,%} came to Vasiṣṭhā-
pavāha they saw the Rākṣasas drinking
blood from the river; they decided to do
something to save the river; they invited
Sarasvatī and found out from her the cause
of the disturbed condition of the {%tīrtha%}
({%kāraṇaṃ brūhi kalyāṇi kimarthaṃ te%}
{%hrado hy ayam / evam ākulatāṃ yātaḥ%}
9. 42. 9); on hearing the cause, they decided
to free the river from the curse; by their
mere word Sarasvatī returned to her normal
condition and her water was as placid as
before ({%teṣāṃ tu vacanād eva prakṛtisthā%}
{%sarasvatī / prasannasalilā jajñe yathā pūr-%}

shone as before; since the river water was
normal again the Rākṣasas were afflicted by
[Page474-b+ 40]
hunger and they requested the sages to relieve
them from that condition; the sages praised
the river and urged her to relieve the Rākṣasas
from their condition; knowing what the sages
wanted Sarasvatī brought to her current the
river Aruṇā ({%aruṇām ānayām āsa svāṃ%}
{%tanum%}); bathing in that river the Rākṣasas
abandoned their bodies and went to heaven
9. 42. 1-25; (12) While Dadhīca was
giving offerings to gods on the bank of Saras-
vatī ({%tasya tarpayato devān sarasvatyām%}
9. 50. 8), the Apsaras Alambusā, sent by
Indra to disturb the austerities of Dadhīca,
approached him; seeing her divine form the
seed of Dadhīca spilled into water of Sara-
svatī; the river held it in her womb as she
desired to have a son and also because the seed
might not be wasted ({%kukṣau cāpy adadhat … %}
{%tad retaḥ … putrahetor mahānadī%} 9. 50. 10;

child at proper time she took him to Dadhīca;
seeing Dadhīca seated in the assembly of
sages she handed over the child to him saying
it was his son whom she bore out of her
devotion to the sage ({%brahmarṣe tava putro%}
{%'yaṃ tvadbhaktyā dhārito mayā%} 9. 50. 12);
Dadhīca accepted the child and was very much
delighted; he then gave the following boon

and Apsarases will be satisfied when they
receive offerings of your water ({%tṛptiṃ yā-%}

son will be known as Sārasvata after the
mother's name ({%tavaiva nāmnā prathitaḥ%}

of the three Asuras.
{@A.@} Creation: Created by Asura Maya
for the three sons of Tāraka, viz. Tārākṣa (or
Tārakākṣa), Kamalākṣa and Vidyunmālin;
the cities were obtained by them as a boon
from Pitāmaha; one of the three cities was
made of gold, the other of silver, and the
third of iron; they moved in them respectively
in heaven, in mid region, and with the third,
stationed on wheels, on the earth; ({%kāñcanaṃ%}

Since Indra was unable to shatter the Tri-
puras, although he used all his weapons
against them, gods approached Rudra and
requested him to destroy the demons and
their cities; Śiva then burnt the three {%puras%}

chariot ({%devān rathavaram kṛtvā%}), god
Viṣṇu as arrow, Agni as tip of the arrow

and three heads (to correspond to the
three {%puras ?%}) ({%triparvaṇā triśalyena … %}

he asked Sātyaki, Baladeva, and Pradyumna

a certain resident of Dvārakā ({%puruṣaḥ%}
{%kaścid dvārakānilayaḥ%}), a servant ({%pari-%}
{%cārakaḥ%}) of Āhuka, met Kṛṣṇa and gave
him a false message from Āhuka; accord-
ing to the message Śālva had attacked
Dvārakā and killed the son of Śūrasena
(Vasudeva); hence Kṛṣṇa was advised to
leave the battle, return to Dvārakā and
protect it; that should be Kṛṣṇa's prime
concern ({%dvārakām eva rakṣasva kāryam%}
{%etan mahat tava%}) 3. 22. 12-14; Kṛṣṇa then
mentally blamed Sātyaki and others who
were entrusted with the protection of Dvā-
rakā and of Vasudeva 3. 22. 16-17; (Kṛṣṇa,
however, soon realized that he was tricked
by Śālva by his {%māyā%} and started to fight

by his charioteer who reminded him that
Dvārakā was ransacked by Śālva ({%dvārakā%}

Yudhiṣṭhira that he was not in Dvārakā
[Page534-a+ 40]

tinapura 3. 14. 1; he heard of the {%dyūta%}

Śālva's attacking Dvārakā and Kṛṣṇa's sub-
sequent battle with him, he comforted Yudhi-
ṣṭhira and returned to Dvārakā 3. 23. 42-45;
(6) Dvārakā was once burnt by Śiśupāla
when Kṛṣṇa and others had gone to Prāg-
jyotiṣapura 2. 42. 7; (7) Prophecies regard-
ing Dvārakā: (i) Nārāyaṇa told Nārada
that at the conjunction of Dvāpara and
Kali ({%dvāparasya kaleś caiva saṃdhau%} 12.

{%sahasrāṇi śatāni ca%}); there was a great
[Page535-a+ 40]
gathering ({%samavāyo mahān abhūt%}) of the
Bhojas, the Vṛṣṇis and the Andhakas;
Arjuna lived (in Dvārakā) in the house
of Kṛṣṇa for many nights 1. 210. 17-21;
once, while Subhadrā was returning to Dvā-
rakā after worshipping Raivataka mountain
she was kidnapped by Arjuna; the helpless
soldiers cried aloud and ran towards Dvā-

in 8. 26. 63; (11) The Yādavas, returned to
Dvāravatī after visiting Indraprastha where
they had gone to give gifts to the Pāṇḍa-
vas in connection with the marriage of
Subhadrā 1. 213. 55; Subhadrā's abduction
by Arjuna from Dvārakā referred to (i) in
the Anukramaṇīparvan 1. 1. 103; also listed

85; (12) After asking Maya to build a
{%sabhā%} for the Pāṇḍavas, Kṛṣṇa left for
Dvārakā 2. 2. 23; (13) Yudhiṣṭhira sent
a messenger to Dvārakā to invite Kṛṣṇa,
living in Dvārakā, for consultations regard-
ing the Rājasūya 2. 12. 29; at the end of the
Rājasūya, Yudhiṣṭhira consented to Kṛṣṇa's
return to Dvāravatī; accordingly Kṛṣṇa
reached Dvāravatī 2. 42. 49, 55, 60; (14)
The sons of Draupadī, during the period of
exile of the Pāṇḍavas, went to Vṛṣṇipura
situated in the Ānarta country 3. 180. 25;
later, Satyabhāmā informed Draupadī that
her sons were all well and happy at Dvāra-
vatī 3. 224. 11; (15) Before going to the
Virāṭanagara for the {%ajñātavāsa,%} Yudhi-
ṣṭhira sent away Indrasena and others, with
their chariots, to Dvāravatī 4. 4. 3; the
spies, who were sent by Duryodhana in
[Page535-b+ 40]
search of the Pāṇḍavas, told him that the
charioteers of the Pāṇḍavas had reached
Dvāravatī but neither the Pāṇḍavas nor
Kṛṣṇā was to be found in Dvāravatī 4. 24.
15-16; (11) After the marriage of Abhi-
manyu, Kṛṣṇa, Balarāma and others, per-
mitted by Virāṭa, went to Dvārakā; after
Kṛṣṇa's departure to Dvārakā, Yudhiṣṭhira
started making all kinds of preparations
for the war ({%cakruḥ sāṅgrāmikaṃ sarvam%})
5. 5. 11-12; 5. 7. 1 (Dvāravatī); (12)
When Duryodhana knew through his messe-
ngers and spies that Kṛṣṇa had returned
to Dvārakā, he started to go there to seek
Kṛṣṇa's help in war; that very day Arjuna
too arrived in Ānartanagarī; both of them,
after reaching Dvārakā, saw Kṛṣṇa sleep-
ing 5. 7. 3 ({%ānartanagarīṃ ramyāṃ jagā-%}
{%māśu dhanaṃjayaḥ%}) 5. 7. 4, 5; (13) When
Balarāma started for his pilgrimage he, on
his way, asked his servants to bring from
Dvārakā all the materials and utensils
required for the pilgrimage, as also the
sacred fires and priests ({%saṃbhārāṃs tīrtha-%}
{%yātrāyāṃ sarvopakaraṇāni ca / ānayadhvaṃ%}
{%dvārakāyā agnīn vai yājakāṃs tathā%}) 9. 34.
15; when Balarāma chose to go to the
battlefield to watch the duel between
Bhīma and Duryodhana, he sent away his
co-pilgrims and attendants to Dvārakā 9.
53. 32; at the end of the duel, Balarāma,
expressing his disapproval of the way
Bhīma brought about the downfall of
Duryodhana, left for Dvārakā 9. 59. 26;
when he left for Dvāravatī, the Pāñcālas
and the Pāṇḍavas, did not feel very happy
9. 59. 27; (14) When the sacrificial horse
for the Aśvamedha of Yudhiṣṭhira reached
Dvāravatī, king Ugrasena came out of the
town to honour Arjuna who accompanied
[Page536-a+ 40]
the horse 14. 84. 13-15; when Yudhiṣṭhira
asked Kṛṣṇa to give some news about
Arjuna (who was accompanying the horse),
Kṛṣṇa told him that a confidential attendant
who lived in Dvārakā ({%dvārakāvāsī mamā-%}
{%ptaḥ puruṣaḥ%}) had seen him (Arjuna) who,
fighting many battles, was emaciated ({%bahu-%}
{%saṃgrāmakarśitam%}) 14. 88. 9; (15) After the
war, Kṛṣṇa informed Arjuna his intention
to return to Dvāravatī to meet his father,
Baladeva and others, if permitted by Yudhi-
ṣṭhira, but not otherwise; hence he wanted
Yudhiṣṭhira to be informed by Arjuna
about his wish to go to Dvārakā 14. 15.
20-21, 26, 31; before Kṛṣṇa's return to
Dvārakā, Arjuna wanted Kṛṣṇa to tell him
once again what he taught him before in the
Gītā 14. 16. 6-7; Arjuna approved Kṛṣṇa's
wish to return to Dvārakā; so he suggest-
ed that they should go to Hāstinapura to
seek Yudhiṣṭhira's permission for Kṛṣṇa's
return to Dvārakā 14. 50. 51; 14. 51. 23;
Arjuna sought Yudhiṣṭhira's permission
for Kṛṣṇa's return to Ānartanagarī 14. 51.
40-41; Yudhiṣṭhira gave Kṛṣṇa his permi-
ssion to return to Dvāravatī to see his
father 14. 51. 42; Arjuna and others emb-
raced Kṛṣṇa when he left Hāstinapura to
go to Dvārakā 14. 52. 1; (16) Yudhiṣṭhira
was grieved to think of what Subhadrā, who
was then in Dvārakā ({%dvārakāvāsinī%}), would
say to Kṛṣṇa when he returned to Dvārakā
(since her son was killed in war) 12. 1. 16;
(17) Aśvatthāman once went to Dvārakā
where he stayed for some time honoured
by the Vṛṣṇis; he wanted to exchange his
Brahmaśiras missile for the Sudarśana of
Kṛṣṇa; while he was in Dvāravatī ({%vasan%}
{%dvāravatīm anu%}), one day he approached
Kṛṣṇa who was sitting alone on seashore;
[Page536-b+ 40]
Kṛṣṇa informed Aśvatthāman that none of
the Vṛṣṇi and the Andhaka heroes who lived
in Dvārakā had ever asked him to part with
his Sudarśana 10. 12. 11-12, 15, 31-33;
(18) The Yādavas, headed by Sāraṇa,
once saw Viśvāmitra, Kaṇva, Nārada and
other sages who were on a visit to Dvārakā
16. 2. 4; by the proclamation of a royal
decree Āhuka prohibited fermentation of
spirituous liquor in all the houses of Vṛṣṇis
and Andhakas living in the town (Dvārakā)
({%adyaprabhṛti sarveṣu vṛṣṇyandhakagṛheṣv-%}
{%iha / surāsavo na kartavyaḥ sarvair nagara-%}
{%vāsibhiḥ%}) 16. 2. 17-18; one of the bad
omens that occurred for the citizens of
Dvārakā was that a laughing black woman
with white teeth entered the houses at
night, stole the marriage threads of women
while they were asleep, and ran through
the streets of Dvārakā ({%kālī strī pāṇḍurair%}

when the Yādavas were destroyed, Kṛṣṇa
entered Dvāravatī and told Vasudeva to
guard the women folk and wait for the
arrival of Arjuna in Dvāravatī 16. 5. 7;
16. 7. 13; when Arjuna reached Dvārakā
with Dāruka the city appeared to him like
a woman who had lost her husband ({%mṛta-%}
{%nāthām iva striyam%}) 16. 6. 4; Arjuna, after
he witnessed the plight of Dvārakā and
the women of Kṛṣṇa he wept loudly and
fell down on the ground 16. 6. 12. {@E.@} Past
events or events not related to the epic
narrative: (1) Kṛṣṇa told Uttaṅka whom
he met on his way to Dvārakā that he
(Uttaṅka) should think of him (Kṛṣṇa)
if he desired something 14. 54. 13; Govinda
[Page537-a+ 40]
(Kṛṣṇa) gave boon to Uttaṅka and went
to Dvārakā in the company of Sātyaki
14. 58. 2, 3 (Dvāravatī); (2) Pious king
Nṛga, due to a sin unknowingly committed
by him (13. 69. 22; 13. 71. 2), had to live
as a lizard in a deep well at Dvāravatī 13.
69. 1-4; Kṛṣṇa liberated him when the
Yādavas were settling down at Dvāravatī
13. 71. 2-3; 13. 69. 25-29; (3) Śiva, in
the form of Durvāsas, lived for a long time
with Kṛṣṇa in his residence at Dvāravatī
13. 145. 35; (4) Yudhiṣṭhira asked Bhīṣ-
ma the kind of gifts which one should
give under different {%nakṣatras (nakṣatra-%}

Bhīṣma then told him what formerly Nārada,

in reply to her question 13. 63. 1-4. {@F.@}
Dvārakā as a holy place: Described as

on a pilgrimage, visited Dvārakā ({%yac cāpi%}

7. 85. 63; a holy place Piṇḍāraka located
in Dvāravatī 3. 80. 82. {@G.@} Similes:
(1) The city Dvārakā was well protected
and well camouflaged and was furnished
with all kinds of weapons as is done for
the residence of Indra ({%surakṣitaṃ sugup-%}

3. 16. 18; (2) As Indra left for heaven
after killing his enemies so did Kṛṣṇa leave
for Ānartapurī (when all the Kauravas
were killed) 14. 51. 56; (3) Dvārakā,
bereft of Vṛṣṇi heroes, compared with a
woman who had lost her husband ({%dvāra-%}
{%kāṃ … mṛtanāthāṃ iva striyam%}) 16. 6. 4;
(4) In a long drawn metaphor Dvārakā
compared to a river: the Vṛṣṇis and the
Andhakas were its water, horses its fishes,
[Page537-b+ 39]
chariots its boats, the sound of musical
instruments and the one produced by
chariots its current, residences and holy
bathing places its big crocodiles, jewels
its thick layer of moss, ramparts made of
{%vajra%} its garlands, streets its whirlpools,
cross-roads its steady, deep pieces of water,
Rāma and Kṛṣṇa its big sharks; this
river in the form of Dvārakā looked like
the terrible Vaitaraṇī river having the noose
of Kāla as its shark ({%tām sa vṛṣṇyan-%}

filled with bards in thousands, accom-

Māndhātṛ about the {%dharma%} of Dasyus
({%kathaṃ dharmaṃ careyus te%} 12. 65. 15),
Indra told him in details the duties of
Dasyus which included service ({%śuṣrūṣā%})
to parents, teachers, elders, ascetics and
kings, gifts to twice-born, observance of
non-violence, truth, purity, faithfulness
and other virtues 12. 65. 17-22; a Dasyu
who lived within limits did not perish
after his death; this is illustrated by
[Page746-b+ 40]

who observed their {%dharma%} achieved
perfections ({%api te dasyavo bhūtvā kṣi-%}

Kṣatriya should always be ready to kill
Dasyus in battles 12. 60. 14; for a king,
there is no higher duty than destroying
Dasyus 12. 60. 17; their absence, (as
also of beggars), in a kingdom considered
desirable 12. 89. 20; a king should take
his subjects into confidence by drawing
their attention to the danger posed by
his enemies who collaborated with Dasyus
12. 88. 26; a king must protect all the
{%varṇas%} if the Dasyus tried to plunder
their wives and possessions 13. 47. 44; a
king who saved the beings from Dasyus
and gave them wealth and happiness
was a great king ({%dasyubhyaḥ prāṇadānāt%}

protect the subjects from Dasyus; any

When Arjuna stopped at Pañcanada on his

of a Kṣatriya) ({%dasyutvāt siddhim āptavān%});
when the Brāhmaṇas, who had retired to
a forest, did not accept food brought to
them by Kāpavya because he was a Dasyu,

away early in the morning; many Dasyus
who behaved cruelly disregarding the rules
elected Kāpavya as their leader; they
agreed to live as instructed by him and
requested him to act as their father
and mother; he taught them the way they

austerities near the confluence of Gaṅgā and

fishes threw their net in water; when they
drew their net they dragged Cyavana along
with fishes; they fell at the feet of Cyavana
and asked him what they should do;
Cyavana told the Niṣadas that he did not
want to forsake the fishes and hence would
get killed or sold along with them; afraid,
the Niṣādas reported the matter to king
Nahuṣa; Nahuṣa asked his priest to pay
one thousand (coins) to the Niṣādas as the
price of fishes and Cyavana; on Cyavana's
denial to accept this price, Nahuṣa went
[Page760-a+ 38]
on bidding higher and higher price to be
paid to Niṣādas; ultimately Cyavana was
purchased by giving a cow to Niṣādas;
they offered it to Cyavana; Cyavana sent

lling Brāhmaṇas advised Pāṇḍavas to do
the same 1. 175. 5; (9) Pāṇḍavas started
for the southern Pāñcālas and reached it
1. 176. 2, 5; this event is referred to
earlier in the summary narration of the
Mahābhārata in the Parvasaṃgrahaparvan
1. 2. 86, and again at 1. 55. 21; (10)
The southern Pāñcālas, afraid of Jarā-
sandha, left their land and went further
south; they also fled in different directions

Rājasūya, won over Pāñcālas by various
means of conciliation ({%pāñcālān vividho-%}

referred to later in 4. 5. 19 where, however,
it is said that he defeated them in battle
({%pāñcālān … saṃgrāme bhīmaseno'jayat%});
Pāñcālas did not pay tribute for Rājasūya
because they had marriage-relationship
with Pāṇḍavas ({%vaivāhikena pāñcālāḥ%}) 2.
48. 42; (12) Vidura told Kauravas that
Pāñcālas would not forgive the torture to
Draupadī (in the Sabhā); Arjuna, prote-
cted by Pāñcālas, would invade them 2.
72. 29-30; (13) Pāñcālas meeting the
Pāṇḍavas in the forest (3. 13. 2) referred
to in the narration of the contents of the
Āraṇyakaparvan 1. 2. 106; (14) Drau-
padī complained to Kṛṣṇa that though
[Page767-a+ 40]
Pāñcālas were alive Kauravas desired
to treat Draupadī as a Dāsī 3. 13. 56; (15)
Dhṛtarāṣṭra was afraid that later Pāñ-
cālas, protected by Kṛṣṇa, would burn the
Kaurava army 3. 48. 6; (16) Bhīma
feared that if Arjuna (who had departed
to get weapons) was dead, Pāñcālas,
Pāṇḍavas and the rest would perish 3. 49.
6; (17) Bhīma told Draupadī that Pāñcā-
las, with the support of Arjuna, would not
be afraid of even gods if they had to fight
with them 3. 79. 20; (18) Before the
{%ajñātavāsa,%} Yudhiṣṭhira asked the women
who attended on Draupadī, as also cooks
and chief cooks, to go to the Pāñcāla
country 4. 4. 4; (19) According to Drau-
padī, the affliction she had to suffer
while living as Sairandhrī meant insult
to Kurus and Pāñcālas 4. 19. 11; (20)
Karṇa told Bhīṣma that Pāṇḍavas were
claiming their share because they depen-
ded on the force of Pāñcālas and Matsyas
({%rājyam icchanti paitṛkam / balam āśritya%}
{%matsyānāṃ pāñcālānāṃ ca%}) 5. 21. 11;
(21) Yudhiṣṭhira could have resorted to
war without going into exile since the
Pāñcālas were always available to him for
guidance ({%nityaṃ pāñcālāḥ sacivās tave-%}
{%me%}) 5. 27. 17; (22) By avoiding war,
Yudhiṣṭhira wished Pāñcālas to meet Kurus
with a smile; he desired both of them to
remain uninjured and, well-disposed, live
in peace ({%akṣatān kurupāñcālān paśyema … %}

Pāñcālas and Pāṇḍavas were waiting for
the orders of Yudhiṣṭhira ({%rājño mukham%}

him when he approached them 5. 49. 4-7;
Saṃjaya also told Dhṛtarāṣṭra that Pāñcā-

pised him ({%nārhanti pāñcālāś … sarve%}

Duryodhana assured Dhṛtarāṣṭra that
Pāñcālas would be attacked by his chariot-
fighters with arrows 5. 56. 42; he also told
him that he would soon hear Pāñcālas
defeated by him 5. 60. 25; (26) Pāñcālas
and Pāṇḍavas counted on Dhṛṣṭadyumna's
fortitude and valour 5. 56. 51; (27) Karṇa
told Duryodhana that the {%brahmāstra%}
he had obtained from Paraśurāma was still
with him and hence due to the favour of
the {%ṛṣi%} (Paraśurāma) he would kill Pāñcā-
las and the rest in no time; that was his

(28) Yudhiṣṭhira, although backed by
Pāñcālas and others, chose to ask for five
villages 5. 70. 14; (29) Even when Pāñcālas
were alive, Draupadī was looked upon as
a {%dāsī%} in the Sabhā of the wretched
Kauravas 5. 80. 25; (30) Kṛṣṇa told
Karṇa that the Pāñcālas and others
would consecrate him as king; Pāñcālas
would follow him in his procession 5.
138. 16-17, 23; (31) Vidura told Kuntī
that Yudhiṣṭhira was supported by Pāñ-
cālas 5. 142. 3; there was nothing more
painful to Kuntī than Pāñcālas and others
fighting with Bhāratas 5. 142. 3, 12; (32)
When Pāñcālas proceeded towards Kuru-
kṣetra, they were led by Bhīmasena 5. 149.

kill Pāñcālas in battle 5. 162. 22; Droṇa was
to burn Pāñcālas ({%pradhakṣyati sa pāñcā-%}
{%lān%}) 5. 164. 20; Pāñcālas would run in all
directions when they encountered Karṇa 5.
165. 21; (34) Pāñcālas and Prabhadrakas
formed the army of Śikhaṇḍin 5. 168. 3;
(35) Hiraṇyavarman's friends wanted to
kill Drupada and instal another king in
the Pāñcāla country if Śikhaṇḍin proved to
be a girl 5. 191. 8; (36) Saṃjaya reported
that Bhīṣma showered arrows on Pāñcālas
6. 15. 25; on the first day of war, Bhīṣma's
chariot moved very often among Pāñcālas
and he killed them 6. 45. 4, 54; (37) On
the second day, Arjuna asked Kṛṣṇa to take
him to Bhīṣma since Droṇa and others,
protected by Bhīṣma, would kill Pāñcālas
6. 48. 15 (13); Pāñcālas cheered loudly
when Dhṛṣṭadyumna cut off a fierce and
shining arrow discharged at him by Droṇa
6. 49. 13; Bhīma was honoured by Pāñcā-
las when he killed Kaliṅga warriors 6. 50.
110 (108); (38) On the third day,
Pāñcālas stood in the middle of the Ardha-
candravyūha of the Pāṇḍavas 6. 52. 14, 10;
Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya how the
Pāñcālas fared against Bhīṣma 6. 55. 2;
seeing the river of blood made to flow by
Arjuna's sharp arrows, Pāñcālas delight-
fully raised a loud roar 6. 55. 126, (121-
125); (39) On the fourth day, the chief
warriors of Pāñcālas stood at the same
place of the same {%vyūha%} as they did on
the previous day 6. 56. 11; when Bhīṣma
and others marched to help Bhagadatta,
Pāñcālas and others chased them; since
Bhīṣma did not like to continue fighting
with Ghaṭotkaca, Pāñcālas and others he
thought of declaring the end of the war
[Page768-b+ 40]
for that day 6. 60. 64, 68; (40) On the
fifth day, although Pāñcālas were getting
killed by Bhīṣma, they rushed at him with
spirited mind ({%āryāṃ yuddhe matiṃ kṛtvā%})
6. 68. 31; (41) On the sixth day, Bhīṣma
put to death the armies of Pāñcālas with
arrows the joints of which were smooth
6. 75. 57; (42) On the seventh day,
Droṇa scattered away Pāñcālas ({%vyadha-%}
{%mat%}) 6. 82. 38; (43) On the eighth day,
Bhīṣma felled down great Pāñcāla archers,
but not afraid of death ({%tyaktvā mṛtyukṛtaṃ%}
{%bhayam%}), they attacked Bhīṣma; he cut off
their hands and heads and broke their
chariots; those who fought from horse-
backs also lost their heads 6. 84. 3-6;
Bhīṣma strove to kill Pāñcālas while Arjuna
fought with their adversaries to protect
them 6. 89. 9; when Bhagadatta wanted
to reach Yudhiṣṭhira, he had to fight
a fierce battle with Pāñcālas who were
prepared to fight with weapons ({%udyatā-%}
{%yudhaiḥ%}) 6. 91. 80; on the night of
that day, Duryodhana reminded Bhīṣma
of his vow to kill Pāñcālas 6. 93. 37;
Bhīṣma assured Duryodhana that he
would kill all Pāñcālas who were taking
part in the war or would get himself killed
by them 6. 94. 14-15; (44) On the ninth
day, Duryodhana told Duḥśāsana that if
they protected Bhīṣma, he would kill
Pāñcālas who had made a common cause
with Pāṇḍavas ({%yattān pāñcālān pāṇḍavaiḥ%}
{%saha%}) 6. 101. 4; (45) On the tenth day,
Dhṛṣṭadyumna, protected by Pāñcālas,
stood behind Sātyaki and Cekitāna in the
Sarvaśatrunibarhaṇavyūha of Pāṇḍavas;
Bhīṣma rushed towards them 6. 104. 4, 6,
29; Pāñcālas tried to check Bhīṣma who
was killing his opponents 6. 105. 8; Bhīṣma
[Page769-a+ 40]
dried up the lustre of the eminent and
very strong Pāñcāla princes ({%pāñcālānāṃ%}
{%ca ye śreṣṭhā rājaputrā mahābalāḥ / teṣāṃ%}
{%ādatta tejāṃsi%}) 6. 105. 31; Bhīṣma sugge-
sted to Yudhiṣṭhira, who was close to him,
that if he desired Bhīṣma to be killed,
Arjuna, Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas should
jointly lead the attack on him; accor-
dingly Arjuna, along with Pāñcālas and
Cedis, and led by Śikhaṇḍin, marched
towards Bhīṣma 6. 111. 15, 26; Bhīṣma
in his battle with Matsyas and Pāñcālas,
alone, killed innumerable elephants and
horses, seven great chariot-fighters, and
in addition five thousand chariot-fighters
and fourteen thousand footsoldiers 6. 113.
21-22; when Bhīṣma killed seven great
chariot-fighters, there arose a great roar
({%kilakilāśabdaḥ%}) among Pāñcālas and
others who, riding horses, chariots, ele-
phants, and also those who fought on foot
attacked Bhīṣma 6. 113. 46-48; when Bhīṣma
fell, Pāñcālas blew conches 6. 114. 107; at
his fall in the evening of the tenth day
({%sāyāhne%}) Pāñcālas were delighted 6. 115.
7; (46) In the summary narration of the
events which occurred while Droṇa was
the general of the Kaurava army, it is
mentioned that the large army of Pāñcālas
was scattered by Droṇa when he agitated
it and penetrated it ({%saṃkṣobhyamāṇā%}
{%droṇena bhidyamānā mahācamūḥ%}); they,
led by Dhṛṣṭadyumna, trembled ({%samakam-%}
{%panta%}) while they got killed by Droṇa
7. 6. 34, 36; whenever Pāñcālas attacked
Droṇa he killed them along with their
horses and broke their chariots; ultimately
Pāñcālas killed Droṇa by doing evil and
cruel deeds ({%pāñcālair aśivaiḥ krūrakarma-%}
{%bhiḥ / hato rukmaratho rājan kṛtvā karma%}
[Page769-b+ 40]
{%suduṣkaram //%}) 7. 7. 20-21, 32; (47) On
the eleventh day, Pāñcālas attacked the
warriors led by Aśvatthāman who attacked
Draupadī's sons 7. 15. 11; at the end of
that day, they praised Arjuna when he
declared the end of the war for the day
7. 15. 50; (48) On the twelfth day, Pāñcā-
las attacked Droṇa; he scattered them
away and repeatedly defeated them 7. 20.
18-19, 23; when a Pāñcāla prince ({%pāñcā-%}
{%lya,%} not named) was killed by Droṇa,
Pāñcālas attacked Droṇa shouting ‘kill
Droṇa, kill Droṇa’; in the fierce battle,
Droṇa threw the excessively angered Pāñ-
cālas ({%bhṛśasaṃkruddhān%}) into disorder
7. 20. 46, 48-49; Pāñcālas, getting killed by
Droṇa, trembled ({%samakampanta%}) 7. 20.
53; they were broken ({%bhagna%}) by Droṇa
7. 21. 1; pierced by Droṇa's arrows, they
were thrown back from their positions
({%calitān%}); Duryodhana pointed out to
Karṇa Droṇa's feat and described the
plight of Pāñcālas 7. 21. 7, 11-14; Pāñcālas
gathered around Bhīma 7. 21. 23; of the
twelve thousand great warriors of Pāñcālas
six thousand followed Śikhaṇḍin 7. 22.
14; the remaining six thousand Prabha-
drakas (Pāñcālas), riding chariots, with
raised weapons and stretched bows, and
making death as their common goal
({%samānamṛtyavo bhūtvā%}) followed Dhṛṣṭa-
dyumna 7. 22. 36-37; Bhagadatta was en-
circled by Yudhiṣṭhira and Pāñcālas; Bhaga-
datta, riding his elephant, scattered them
away; he forced them to run away 7. 25. 24,
26, 41; Pāñcālas, shouting ‘(attack) Droṇa’
({%droṇam droṇam iti … pāñcālāḥ samaco-%}
{%dayan%}) incited one other; wherever Droṇa
attacked the group of Pāñcāla chariot-
fighters, Dhṛṣṭadyumna went to their help
[Page770-a+ 40]
7. 30. 6, 8; although afflicted by Droṇa's
arrows ({%śarārtāḥ%}), Pāñcālas did not give up
fighting with him; Droṇa killed many of
them 7. 31. 38-39; (49) On the thirteenth
day, Pāñcālas, checked by Droṇa's arrows
could not approach him who was protecting
Kaurava army; that was a wonderful feat
({%tad adbhutam apaśyāma … /yad enaṃ%}
{%nābhyavartanta pāñcālāḥ … %}) 7. 34. 10;
Bhīma assured Abhimanyu that he, Pāñcā-
las and others would follow him when he
entered the Cakravyūha 7. 34. 22; Duḥśā-
sana told Duryodhana that he would kill
Abhimanyu in the presence of Pāṇḍavas
and Pāñcālas 7. 38. 22; when Duḥśāsana
swooned in his encounter with Abhimanyu,
Pāñcālas raised a loud roar; led by Yudhi-
ṣṭhira they then attacked Droṇa's army
7. 39. 17-18; Pāñcālas and others attacked
Jayadratha who foiled their attempt to
follow Abhimanyu 7. 42. 18; Arjuna would
have himself protected Abhimanyu if he
had known that Pāñcālas could not do
that 7. 50. 74; Subhadrā wondered who
could kill Abhimanyu as though he was
helpless when heroic Pāñcālas were there
to help him 7. 55. 9; she felt contempt for
the strength of Pāñcālas ({%pāñcālānāṃ ca%}
{%dhig balam%}) 7. 55. 12; (50) Saṃjaya told
the grieving Dhṛtarāṣṭra that Pāṇḍavas and
Pāñcālas would (at the end of the war)
realize that the calamity was due to his fail-
ure to adopt the right course ({%tat te buddhi-%}
{%vyabhīcāram upalapsyanti … /pāñcālā … %})
7. 62. 7; (51) On the fourteenth day,
Pāñcālas fought a fierce battle with Kurus in
front of the {%vyūha%} of Droṇa; Droṇa and
many other kings on the side of Kauravas
checked the onward march of Pāñcālas;
when Kaurava army was being killed by
[Page770-b+ 40]
Pāṇḍavas, Droṇa scattered away Pāñcālas
with arrows 7. 70. 3, 13-14, 27; Pāñcāla
chariot-fighters saved Dhṛṣṭadyumna from
the attack of Droṇa 7. 72. 35; Dhṛtarāṣṭra
asked Saṃjaya what did the Pāñcālas do
when in their attempt to get close to Arjuna,
they were checked by Droṇa ({%bhāradvājena%}
{%saṃvṛtāḥ%}); Saṃjaya told him that in
the afternoon of that day Kurus and
Pāñcālas fought each other with Droṇa
as the bet ({%aparāhṇe mahārāja saṃgrā-%}
{%me … /pāñcālānāṃ kurūṇāṃ ca droṇe%}
{%dyūtam avartata //%}); Pāñcālas, wanting
to kill Droṇa showered arrows on him;
in the fierce battle, Pāñcālas, wanting to
break the army, used important missiles
({%tadanīkaṃ bibhitsanto mahāstrāṇi vyadar-%}
{%śayan%}) 7. 81. 1-5; demon Alambusa made
a river of blood flow carrying away
(dead) Pāñcālas 7. 83. 30; Droṇa killed
twentyfive Pāñcāla warriors, known as great
chariot-fighters and honoured by Dhṛṣṭa-
dyumna ({%mahārathasamākhyātā dhṛṣṭa-%}
{%dyumnasya saṃmatāḥ%}); he killed choice
Pāñcāla warriors ({%pāñcālānāṃ … varān%}
{%varān%}) 7. 85. 28-29; when Droṇa defeated
hundreds and thousands of Pāñcālas and
killed many of them there went up a cry (of
grief) ({%teṣām samabhavac chabdo vadhya-%}
{%tāṃ droṇasāyakaiḥ%}) 7. 85. 31-32; gods, Gan-
dharvas and others who were watching the
battle pointed out to one another the runn-
ing away Pāñcālas 7. 85. 33; in the absence
of Sātyaki, Yudhiṣṭhira was to be prote-
cted by Pāñcālas and others 7. 86. 45;
Pāñcālas, when they faced Kṛtavarman,
were attacked by him; hence they lost enthu-
siasm ({%vigatotsāhāḥ%}); but soon, like noble
men, were ready to fight again desirous
of attaining great fame ({%atiṣṭhann ārya-%}
[Page771-a+ 40]

57-59 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 7. 113. 67: {%āryavat%}
{%kulīnavat kulīnatvād iti yāvat%}); when
defeated by Kṛtavarman they fled hither and
thither 7. 90. 47-48; Dhṛtarāṣṭra wanted to
know how Pāñcālas fought with Droṇa;
both were deeply inimical to each other
and Pāñcālas desired victory for Yudhi-
ṣṭhira 7. 89. 41; Droṇa, having seen that his
{%vyūha%} was put into disorder by Pāṇḍavas
and Pāñcālas, endeavoured to put it into
order; he succeeded in pushing back
Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālas 7. 93. 35; brave
Pāñcālas and Pāṇḍavas rushed from all
sides on Droṇa to kill him 7. 97. 51; Duḥśā-
sana had formed great enmity with Pāñcā-
las 7. 98. 4; Droṇa hastened moderately to-
wards Pāñcālas ({%javam āsthāya madhya-%}
{%mam%}) and put them to flight; announcing
his name while fighting ({%nāma viśrāvya%}
{%saṃyuge%}) he killed many of them 7. 98. 24-
26; Pāñcālas covered Droṇa from all sides
when he was checked by Vīraketu; they
showered Droṇa with fiery arrows, costly
Tomaras ({%tomaraiś ca mahādhanaiḥ%}) and
various other weapons; Droṇa broke their
arrows 7. 98. 30-32; Pāñcālas shouted that
Droṇa would surrender to their king ({%vaśam%}
{%eṣyati no rājñaḥ%}) 7. 98. 55; when the horses
of Dhṛṣṭadyumna's chariot ran in all
directions, Droṇa forced Pāñcālas to run
away; defeating them Droṇa put his {%vyūha%}
in order ({%svaṃ vyūhaṃ punar āsthāya%}) 7.
98. 57-58; when Duryodhana challenged
Yudhiṣṭhira, Pāñcālas rushed towards
him; Droṇa checked their advance 7.
100. 36-38; Dhṛṣṭaketu wanted to attack
Droṇa who was killing Pāñcāla army 7.
101. 23; Pāñcālas trembled ({%samakam-%}
{%panta%}) as they were getting killed by
[Page771-b+ 40]
Droṇa 7. 101. 47, 53; the great fighters of
Pāñcālas were as though held at their thighs
by Droṇa ({%ūrugrāhagṛhītā hi pāñcālānāṃ%}
{%mahārathāḥ%}) 7. 101. 49 (Nī. on Bom. Ed.
7. 125. 52: {%ūrugrāhaḥ ūrustambhaḥ%}); when
Cekitāna's charioteer was killed, Pāñcālas
were afraid; Droṇa made them run away
7. 101. 67-68; when Pāñcāla army was
reduced in number by Droṇa, Yudhiṣṭhira
did not know who could go to save them
7. 102. 3-4; when the {%vyūhas%} of Pāṇḍavas
were put into disorder, Pāñcālas and
Pārthas went back a long way ({%vyūheṣv%}
{%āloḍyamāneṣu pāṇḍavānāṃ tatas tataḥ /%}
{%sudūram anvayuḥ pārthāḥ pāñcālāḥ saha%}
{%somakaiḥ //%}) 7. 102. 1; when Bhīma started
to help Arjuna, Pāñcālas followed him 7.
102. 67: Droṇa wanted to remain at his
place to check the advancing Pāñcālas 7.
105. 21; Dhṛtarāṣṭra told Saṃjaya that if
ever Pāñcālas were to fight with Bhīma
they would not be able to protect their
lives ({%na bhīmamukhasaṃprāpto mucyeteti%}
{%matir mama / … na pāñcālā … jānanti%}
{%yudhi saṃrabdhā jīvitaṃ parirakṣitum%})
7. 110. 22-23; Duryodhana pointed out
to Droṇa, Śikhaṇḍin who led the Pāñcāla
army 7. 125. 11; he told Droṇa that
either he would kill Pāñcālas and Pāṇḍa-
vas or else get killed by them 7. 125. 25;
Droṇa felt himself sinking in the sin of
Dhṛṣṭadyumna since he had not yet killed
him, Śikhaṇḍin and Pāñcālas ({%majjantam%}
{%iva cātmānaṃ dhṛṣṭadyumnasya kilbiṣe%});
he could not take off his armour until he
had killed Pāñcālas 7. 126. 25, 32; (52)
In the fierce battle that was fought during
the night between fourteenth and fifteenth
day the reporters on the battlefield like
Saṃjaya could distinguish the Pāñcālas from
[Page772-a+ 40]
Kurus only by hearing their personal names
and the names of their respective {%gotras%}
and families ({%gotrānāṃ nāmadheyānāṃ%}
{%kulānāṃ caiva tuāriṣa / śravaṇād dhi%}
{%vijānīmaḥ pāñcālān kurubhiḥ saha //%});
Pāñcālas fled in all directions when
they were being killed by Duryodhana
7. 128. 2, 8, 17; at that time Pāñcālas led
by Bhīma attacked Duryodhana; when
deeply wounded, Duryodhana sat down in
his chariot, Pāñcālas felt he was dead and
delightfully they raised a loud cry 7. 128.
21, 23; when Duryodhana attacked Yudhi-
ṣṭhira, Pāñcālas advanced towards him;
Droṇa faced them 7. 128. 33; Drupada,
protected by Pāñcālas turned towards
Droṇa; six thousand Pāñcālas, led by Śikha-
ṇḍin, rushed towards Droṇa 7. 129. 8, 10;
Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya when Droṇa,
after the death of Jayadratha and Bhūriśra-
vas, attacked Pāñcālas, what did Arjuna
do ? when Droṇa entered the Pāñcāla army,
how was he (later) killed ? 7. 130. 3, 7;
when Droṇa used Vāyavyāstra, Pāñcālas
ran away due to fear; but when Bhīma
and Arjuna invaded the Kaurava army,
Pāñcālas followed them 7. 132. 38, 41;
Karṇa asked Duryodhana to save the
Kaurava warriors attacked on all sides by
Pāñcālas and others; Pāñcāla chariot-
fighters, feeling victorious and delighted,
were making loud sound; he assured
Duryodhana that he would kill Pāñcālas
who had come forward to fight 7. 133. 3,
4, 6, 11; the victorious Pāñcālas raised a
cry seeing Karṇa engaged in battle with
Pāṇḍavas; Duryodhana asked his army to
stand still for he was going to kill the atta-
cking Pāñcālas; he also requested Aśva-
tthāman to kill Pāñcālas since they, feeling
[Page772-b+ 39]
victorious, moved in the Kaurava army
like forest-fire; Aśvatthāman was born for
killing Pāñcālas and make the world devoid
of them; that was declared by the Siddhas,
and it was bound to be true ({%kariṣyasi%}
{%jagat sarvam apāñcālaṃ kilācyuta / evaṃ%}
{%siddhābruvan vāco bhaviṣyati ca tat%}
{%tathā / %}); Pāñcālas would not be able to
withstand the {%astras%} of Aśvatthāman 7.
134. 11, 54, 76-77, 79-81; Aśvatthāman
assured Duryodhana that he would fight
with Pāñcālas for Duryodhana's delight;
they would run away in all directions when
burnt down by his arrows; when Yudhiṣṭhira
would see Pāñcālas dead, he would be
dejected; Aśvatthāman then challenged Pāñ-
cālas to steady themselves and fight with
him; he asked their great chariot-fighters
to strike him showing their skill in the use
of {%astras (praharadhvam itaḥ sarve mama%}
{%gātre mahārathāḥ / sthirībhūtāś ca yudhya-%}
{%dhvaṃ darśayanto 'stralāghavam //);%} when
addressed, Pāñcālas showered weapons
(arrows ?) on Aśvatthāman ({%śastravṛṣṭim%}
{%apātayan%}); Aśvatthāman repulsed the
arrows and killed ten heroes in the
presence of Pāṇḍavas and Dhṛṣtadyumna;
when Pāñcālas were getting killed, they
ran away in all directions; seeing that,
Dhṛṣṭadyumna rushed at Aśvatthāman; in
the duel that ensued, Dhṛṣṭadyumna was
covered on all sides by the entire Pāñcāla
army; Aśvatthāman, by his well-joined
arrows, forced hundreds and thousands of
Pāñcālas to flee ({%bāṇaiḥ saṃnataparva-%}
{%bhiḥ%}); he killed a hundred Pāñcālas with
a hundred arrows ({%śatena ca śataṃ hatvā%}),
and three great chariot-fighters with three
sharp arrows ({%tribhiś ca niśitair bāṇair%}
{%hatvā trīn vai mahārathān%}); he thus killed
[Page773-a+ 40]
a large number of those Pāñcālas who
were prepared for fight ({%nāśayām āsa%}
{%pāñcālān bhūyiṣṭhaṃ ye vyavasthitāḥ%});
Pāñcālas, thus getting killed, left Aśvatthā-
man and went away with their chariots
and banners shattered; Aśvatthāman having
defeated his enemies, uttered a loud roar 7.
135. 10, 11, 13; 16-21; 36, 47, 49-52;
Droṇa used {%vāyavyāstra%} against Pāñcālas;
getting killed, they ran away; when Bhīma
and Arjuna attacked the left and the right
flank respectively ({%bībhatsur dakṣiṇaṃ%}
{%pārśvam uttaraṃ tu vṛkodaraḥ%}), great
chariot-fighters among Pāñcālas followed
them; Droṇa blew away ({%vyadhamat%}) the
Pāṇḍava army and Pāñcālas at the start of
the night ({%rajanīmukhe%}) 7. 136. 11, 14; 7.
137. 51; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya, when
Droṇa entered the Pāñcāla army and
burnt their hosts of chariots who prote-
cted him on all the four sides 7. 139. 12-14;
when Pāñcālas and Kauravas killed one
another they raised a fierce sound ({%āsīn%}
{%niṣṭānako ghoro nighnatām itaretaram%}) 7.
139. 32; Yudhiṣṭhira asked Pāñcālas and
others to attack Droṇa to kill him; then,
raising fearful cries they attacked him 7.
140. 2-3; when Aśvatthāman swooned
while fighting with Ghaṭotkaca, Pāñcālas
raised a loud roar 7. 141. 32; when Duryo-
dhana, while fighting with Bhīma, lost his
charioteer and horses, he was considered
dead; Pāñcālas then attacked Droṇa 7. 141.
60; after defeating Sahadeva, Karṇa turned
towards Pāñcālas 7. 142. 16; when Śikha-
ṇḍin was defeated by Kṛpa. Pāñcālas
covered him on all sides 7. 144. 27; they
also covered him when he attacked Droṇa
7. 145. 3; in the great battle that followed
between the two heroes, Pāñcālas also
[Page773-b+ 40]
took part 7. 145. 68; when Sātyaki and
Duryodhana were engaged in battle, there
was confused and fierce fighting between
Bhāratas and Pāñcālas ({%tataḥ samabhavad%}
{%yuddham ākulam … /pāñcālānāṃ ca sarve-%}
{%ṣāṃ bhāratānāṃ ca dāruṇam //%}) 7. 146. 17;
incited by Duryodhana, Droṇa fought
fiercely and started killing Pāñcālas; then
they raised a tumultuous cry; when they
were broken and shattered, dejected Kṛṣṇa
pointed out to Arjuna their plight 7. 147.
15, 22-23; he advised Arjuna to assist
their great chariot-fighters, as well as Bhīma,
to give encouragement to the entire army
({%āśvāsanārthaṃ sarveṣāṃ sainyānām%}) 7.
147. 29; Karṇa oppressed the great chariot-
fighters among Pāñcālas ({%pāñcālānāṃ%}
{%mahārathān / abhyapīḍayat%}); pressed hard
by Karṇa, the large Pāñcāla army ran away
({%sā pīḍyamānā tu karṇena pāñcālānāṃ%}
{%mahācamūḥ / saṃprādravat susaṃtrastā%});
their warriors fell down from horses, ele-
phants and chariots; Karṇa cut off their
hands, heads and thighs; Droṇa assisted
him 7. 148. 9-19; Kṛṣṇa pointed out to
Ghaṭotkaca their plight 7. 148. 45; Pāñcālas,
smiling, watched the battle between Karṇa
and Ghaṭotkaca 7. 152. 5; Pāñcālas,
oppressed excessively by Alāyudha, had no
peace of mind ({%na śāntiṃ lebhire tatra … %}
{%bhṛśapīḍitāḥ%}) 7. 152. 31; Karṇa forced
the Pāñcāla {%mahārathas%} to run away;
then they fought with Droṇa; they raised
a loud roar when Alāyudha was killed by
Ghaṭotkaca 7. 153. 8, 10, 33; Karṇa attack-
ed Pāñcālas led by Dhṛṣṭadyumna and
Śikhaṇḍin 7. 154. 3-4; Saṃjaya told
Dhṛtarāṣṭra that every night Duryodhana
asked Karṇa to kill next day Arjuna (or
Kṛṣṇa) with his {%śakti%} so that the Pāñ-
[Page774-a+ 40]
cālas could be ruled as if they were
servants ({%preṣyavat pāṇḍupāñcālān upa-%}
{%bhokṣyāmahe tataḥ%})—Pāñcālas who were
like the leaves of a tree in the form of
the Pāṇḍavas ({%pāñcālāḥ patrasaṃjñitāḥ%})
7. 157. 19-22; Dhṛtarāṣṭra was curious to
know how the Sṛñjayas and Pāñcālas who,
armed and in battle-arrays ({%vyūḍhānīkāḥ%}
{%prahāriṇaḥ%}) fought with Droṇa when they
attacked him (7. 158. 13); when, Yudhi-
ṣṭhira after the death of Ghaṭotkaca started
to fight with Kauravas, Pāñcālas armed
for battle ({%daṃśitāḥ%}) beat {%bheris%} and
blew conches 7. 158. 50; Droṇa vowed
that he would take off his armour only
after he had killed Pāñcālas 7. 160. 12;
towards the end of the night war, Droṇa
divided his army into two parts and,
led by Duryodhana, attacked Pāñcālas;
they were specifically afflicted by the arrows
of Droṇa; yet, although suffering from
excessive pain, Pāñcālas continued to
fight ({%pāñcālās tu viśeṣeṇa droṇasāyaka-%}
{%pīḍitāḥ / samasajjanta rājendra samare%}
{%bhṛśavedanāḥ%}) 7. 161. 3, 28; when Droṇa
killed Virāṭa, Drupada, and other warriors
of Pāñcālas, Dhṛṣṭadyumna cursed the
Pāñcāla warriors who would let Droṇa
remain alive or turn away from him;
Pāñcālas then attacked Droṇa, but they
could not even look at Droṇa although
they tried, protected as he was by Duryo-
dhana and others ({%yatamānāpi pāñcālā%}
{%na śekuḥ parivīkṣitum%}) 7. 161. 35-37, 38,
40; (53) On the fifteenth day, when the
large armies of Kauravas and Pāñcālas
clashed with one another, everything
was in turmoil and nothing was quite
clear ({%āvignam abhavat sarvam … na%}
{%prājñāyata kiṃcana%}); in the raised dust
[Page774-b+ 40]
it was difficult to know who were Kaura-
veyas and who Pāñcālas 7. 162. 22, 27-28;
during the duel between Karṇa and Bhīma,
Yudhiṣṭhira addressed the chief heroes of
Pāñcālas and urged them to go and help the
chief warriors of Pāṇḍavas ({%pāñcālānāṃ%}
{%naravyāghrān … tatra gacchata yatraite%}
{%yudhyante māmakā rathāḥ%}); Pāñcālas, thus
urged, divided their army into four parts
({%caturdhā vāhinīṃ kṛtvā%}): a part hit
Droṇa with arrows; others, led by Bhīma,
covered him from another side ({%pāñcā-%}
{%lās tv ekato droṇam abhyaghnan bahubhiḥ%}
{%śaraiḥ / bhīmasenapurogāś ca ekataḥ parya-%}
{%vārayan // %}); Arjuna was urged to separate
Kurus from Droṇa; then Pāñcālas would
kill Droṇa whose protectors were slain; but
Droṇa attacked Pāñcālas and killed them;
however, they continued to attack Droṇa;
as they were getting killed a fearful sound
was raised by them; when Pāñcālas were
thus getting killed, Pāṇḍavas were afraid
and they lost hope of victory ({%vadhya-%}

{%bhayam āviśat / … nāśaṃsur vijayaṃ tadā //%})
7. 164. 48-54, 56-58, 60-63; after the
false news of Aśvatthāman's death twenty
thousand Pāñcāla principal heroes ({%nara-%}
{%rṣabhāḥ%}) showered arrows from all sides on
Droṇa; he then used {%brahmāstra%} to kill
Pāñcālas; with that missile he cut off their
heads and large arms adorned with gold
ornaments ({%tathaiva parighākārān bāhūn%}
{%kanakabhūṣaṇān%}) and killed twenty thou-
sand Pāñcāla chariot-fighters ({%viṃśati-%}
{%sāhasrān pāñcālānāṃ rathavrajān%}) 7. 164.
78-83; that day Kauravas, led by Droṇa,
had started fighting only with Pāñcālas
({%pāñcālair eva kevalaiḥ%}), and when Droṇa
released the {%brahmāstra,%} especially Pāñcālas
[Page775-a+ 40]
were killed ({%pāñcālāś ca viśeṣataḥ / … vyana-%}
{%śan%}); when their armies were thus thrashed,
Pāñcālas, (though) angered, turned away
from battle ({%amarṣavaśam āpannāḥ pāñcālā%}
{%vimukhābhavan%}) 7. 165. 98, 100-101, 104;
Droṇa killed hosts of chariot-fighters of
Pāñcālas but was killed 8. 4. 5; (54) After
the death of Droṇa, Aśvatthāman assured
Duryodhana that he would try to kill
Pāñcālas by all sorts of means, whether
soft or harsh ({%sarvopāyāir … karmaṇā%}
{%yena teneha mṛdunā dāruṇena vā%}); only
after killing Pāñcālas he would have peace
of mind; he would force Pāñcālas to run
away by the use of Nārāyaṇāstra 7. 166.
28-29, 52; Sahadeva, in order to pacify
Sātyaki, told him that the Pāṇḍavas had
no allies other than Andhakas, Vṛṣṇis and
Pāñcālas; similarly the Pāñcālas had no
allies other than Pāṇḍavas and Vṛṣṇis 7.
169. 48, 50; when, after the death of Droṇa,
Kauravas and Pāṇḍava-Pāñcālas became
ready to fight, Aśvatthāman aimed his
Nārāyaṇāstra against the Pāṇḍavas and
Pāñcālas; Yudhiṣṭhira, afraid of the effects
produced by the {%astra,%} asked Dhṛṣṭadyu-
mna to run away with Pāñcāla army; he
also remembered that Pāñcālas. led by
Satyajit and making effort for his victory,
were totally destroyed by Droṇa ({%pāñcālāḥ%}
{%satyajinmukhāḥ / kurvāṇā majjaye yatnaṃ%}
{%samūlā vinipātitāḥ%}) 7. 170. 10, 15, 26, 34;
Duryodhana urged Aśvatthāman to use
Nārāyaṇāstra again when Pāficālas, wishing
victory, had steadied themselves ({%vyavasthitā%}
{%hi pāñcālāḥ punar eva jayaiṣiṇaḥ%}); Aśva-
tthāman told him his inability to do that
but he forced Pāñcālas to run away wound-
ing them with arrows; when Aśvatthāman
succeeded in killing many prominent
[Page775-b+ 40]
(Pāñcāla) heroes on the side of Pāṇḍavas
he blew his large conch with delight;
hearing that all Pāñcālas, and even Bhīma,
ran in all directions leaving Dhṛṣṭadyumna
behind 7. 171. 25, 45, 67; (55) Saṃjaya,
summarizing the events between the death
of Droṇa and that of Karṇa, told Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra that Duryodhana assured his army
that they would be witnesses to the heroism
of Karṇa and Aśvatthāman against the
Pāñcālas; Karṇa killed and afflicted many
Pāñcālas, but was ultimately killed by
Arjuna 8. 2. 15, 18, 20; 8. 5. 30; Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra remembered that Karṇa had once be-
fore defeated Pāñcālas and made them pay
tribute ({%ajaiṣīt … pāñcālāṃś ca … cakre%}
{%balibhṛtaḥ purā%}) 8. 5. 18-20 (reference
to Karṇa's conquests before the Vaiṣṇava
sacrifice of Duryodhana 3. 241. 29, 32; 3.
App. I. 24. 28-34); (56) On the sixteenth
day, Duryodhana requested Karṇa to lead
the Kaurava army because when Pāñcālas
would see him they would run away;
Pāṇḍavas together with Pāñcālas would be
disheartened on seeing Karṇa ready to
fight ({%pāṇḍavā gatacetasaḥ … pāñcālaiḥ%}
{%saha%}); the bards urged Karṇa to kill
Pāñcālas and bring victory to Kauravas;
they also said that Pāñcālas would not be
able to withstand Karṇa ready with his
arms 8. 6. 30-31, 40, 42; Pāñcālas and
others rushed at the Kaurava army; their
chariot-fighters, elephant-riders and impor-
tant foot-soldiers, delighted, danced and
laughed making different sounds ({%nānā-%}
{%vidharavair hṛṣṭā nṛtyanti ca hasanti ca%})
8. 8. 19-20; Karṇa put to death twenty
Pāñcāla chariot-fighters along with their
horses and charioteers and felled down
their banners; he also killed many other
[Page776-a+ 40]
Pāñcālas; then Pāñcāla princes ({%? pāñcāla-%}
{%putrāś ca%}) attacked Karṇa 8. 16. 16, 22-23;
heroes from the east and south, skilled
in elephant-warfare, showered arrows,
{%tomaras%} and {%nārācas%} on Pāñcālas; Pāñcā-
las, with sharp weapons, surrounded the
elephants and showered arrows on them;
they covered Nakula to protect him from
those who were fighting from elephants;
Karṇa, after defeating Nakula, turned
towards Pāñcālas; Pāṇḍavas raised a loud
cry seeing Karṇa approach Pāñcāla
chariot-fighters ({%dṛṣṭvā senāpatiṃ yāntaṃ%}
{%pāñcālānāṃ rathavrajān%} 8. 17. 99); their
chariots then were carried away (by horses)
with or without the charioteers and
their axles broken; those Pāñcāla {%mahā-%}
{%rathas%} who survived began to run away;
Karṇa, showering arrows, persecuted Pāñ-
cālas whose armours and banners were
broken and tormented them with arrows 8.
17. 7, 21, 98-99, 101, 119-120; Ulūka, after
defeating Yuyutsu, turned towards Pāñcālas
striking them with arrows 8. 18. 11; when
Yudhiṣṭhira fought a duel with Duryo-
dhana, Pāñcālas attacked Kauravas making
sounds ({%kṣveḍāḥ kilakilāśābdāḥ%}) and
striking thousands of {%tūryas;%} men fought
against men, elephants against elephants,
chariots against chariot-fighters and horses
against horse-riders; those duels were for
a while pleasing to watch ({%dvandvāny āsan%}
{%mahārāja prekṣaṇīyāni saṃyuge; muhūr-%}

{%vratam anuṣṭhitāḥ / na hi te samaraṃ cakruḥ%}
{%pṛṣthato vai kathaṃcana //%}) 8. 19. 45-49;
but later the battle was fought disregarding
[Page776-b+ 40]
the proper norms; the battle described
in 8. 19. 49 ff.; Karṇa killed Pāñcālas 8. 19.
74; (57) On the seventeenth day, Duryo-
dhana wanted Karṇa and Śalya together
to kill Pāṇḍavas along with Pāñcālas and
Sṛñjayas 8. 23. 15; Karṇa asked Śalya to
drive his chariot to Pāñcālas and others;
either he would kill them or they would
kill him; Śalya pointed out to Karṇa that
the banners and the chariots of Pāñcālas
were making sound ({%dhvajāḥ kaṇakaṇā-%}
{%yante … sapatākā rathāś cāpi pāñcālānām%})
8. 31. 51; a fierce battle broke out between
Pāñcālas and Kauravas; Duryodhana
protected Karṇa fighting with Pāñcālas and
other heroes; Karṇa rushed towards
Dhṛṣṭadyumna and Pāñcālas who rushed
at him; Karṇa killed twentyfive Pāñcāla
warriors with equal number of arrows;
hosts of Pāñcāla chariot-fighters then
surrounded Karṇa; Karṇa killed with five
arrows five Pāñcāla prominent warriors viz.
Bhānudeva, Citrasena, Senābindu, Tapana
and Śūrasena; then there was a loud cry
of anger among the Pāñcālas ({%hāhākāro%}
{%mahān āsīt pāñcālānāṃ mahāhave%}); but
Pāñcālas, equipped ({%daṃśitāḥ%}), attacked
Karṇa 8. 32. 15, 20, 25-26, 33, 35-38,
43; they checked the advance of Karṇa; he
could not break through their resistance
to reach Yudhiṣṭhira; when he reached
Yudhiṣṭhira and defeated him the latter
turned back and Pāñcālas followed him 8.
33. 7, 9, 15, 41; Pāñcālas and others gathered
together and, disregarding the terrible fear
of death ({%tyaktvā mṛtyubhayaṃ ghoram%}),
attacked Aśvatthāman 8. 39. 10; Karṇa
killed Pāñcālas by thousands 8. 40. 4-5;
when he attacked them, no one of them
turned back; they attacked Karṇa from all
[Page777-a+ 40]
sides; he moved among them unafraid;
he made hosts of their chariot-fighters run
away 8. 40. 42, 44, 58-59; Karṇa, single-
handed, announcing his name ({%viśrāvya%}
{%nāma%}) killed many Pāñcālas, respected by
brave ({%śūrasaṃmatāḥ%}); onlookers like
Saṃjaya felt that no Pāñcāla warrior
would be allowed to live by Karṇa; Karṇa,
while blowing away Pāñcālas ({%vidhaman%}),
rushed towards Yudhiṣṭhira; he, alone,
fought with Cedis, Pāñcālas and Pāṇḍavas
8. 40. 62-64, 68; Pāñcālas, led by Dhṛṣṭa-
dyumna, followed Bhīma and returned to
battle ({%tam ete 'nu nivartante%}) 8. 41. 3;
Karṇa, alone, held back Pāñcālas and
others; when Pāñcālas saw that Dhṛṣṭa-
dyumna was saved by Arjuna, they, consi-
dering themselves victorious, sounded
musical instruments by thousands and
made loud roar 8. 42. 32, 54-55; Pāñcālas
quickly rallied round Yudhiṣṭhira to help
him; in the presence of Pāñcālas and
others, Karṇa broke the banner on the
chariot of Yudhiṣṭhira; he destroyed the
army of Pāṇḍavas (including Pāñcālas);
Pāñcālas started to run away; Karṇa had
already defeated them; it was felt that Karṇa
attacking them would extirpate Pāñcālas
({%samucchetsyati%}); but when Bhīma appear-
ed, Pāñcālas started killing Kaurava army
8. 43. 3, 22-29, 31-32, 50, 53; chariot-
fighters ({%rathinaḥ%}) of Kauravas, struck
by Pāñcālas, fell down from their chariots;
Pāñcālas returned towards the army of
Kauravas ({%dhārtarāṣṭrān%}) and killed those
who, riding elephants, horses and chariots,
were fighting; supported by Bhīma, Pāñcālas
disregarded their lives and crushed their
enemies; while killing their adversaries,
they blew conches and shouted; when the
[Page777-b+ 40]
Pāñcālas were thus killing the Kaurava
army, Kṛpa, Karṇa and other heroes made
great attempt to stop their attack 8. 43.
59-65; but Pāñcālas, enraged and feeling
victorious, attacked the Kaurava army
from all sides 8. 44. 8; Karṇa assured Śalya
that he would kill all Pāñcālas and Pāṇḍa-
vas and then released his Bhārgavāstra
against them; Pāñcālas, afflicted by that
missile, raised a loud cry ({%hāhākāro mahān%}
{%āsīt pāñcālānām … %}); getting killed by the
missile Pāñcālas were all confused ({%tatra%}
{%tatra vyamuhyanta%}) 8. 45. 32, 37, 41; Karṇa
cut off the banner of Yudhiṣṭhira and killed
his two side-charioteers in the presence of
Pāñcālas ({%hatau ca pārṣṇisārathī%}) 8.
46. 12; Kṛṣṇa told Arjuna: all Pāñcālas,
under Arjuna's guidance, were ready to
fight; protected by him, they had killed
enemies; Bhīṣma had earlier killed Pāñcālas;
Arjuna now should kill the enemies, viz.
the five great warriors Aśvatthāman, Kṛta-
varman, Karṇa, Śalya and Kṛpa, so that
Pāñcālas might rejoice ({%adya modantu pāñ-%}
{%cālā … %}); Pāñcālas wished to rescue Pāṇḍa-
vas ({%pāṇḍavān ujjihīrṣavaḥ%}) but were fleeing
as they got killed by Karṇa; they were as
good as under the control of Karṇa ({%viddhi%}
{%karṇavaśaṃ gatān%}); Pāñcālas, struck by
Karṇa, raised a fierce cry ({%śrūyate ninado%}
{%ghoras … %}); when they faced Bhīṣma, they
never turned back ({%nāsan parāṅmukhāḥ%});
they would not turn back due to fear of
Karṇa; Karṇa was killing the attacking
Pāñcālas by hundreds — Pāñcālas who
gave lives for their friends; Pāñcālas were
fleeing in all directions ({%ete caranti pāñcālā%}
{%dikṣu sarvāsu%}) as they faced the irresisti-
ble {%astra%} of Karṇa obtained by him from
Bhārgava (8. 51. 101); if Karṇa was
[Page778-a+ 40]
neglected ({%upekṣitaḥ karṇo … %}); he would
kill Pāñcālas and the rest 8. 51. 5-6, 12, 27,
54, 91-96, 98-100, 104, 106; Arjuna saw
Pāñcāla army running away; he desired to
pay back the debt he owed to Pāñcālas
by killing Karṇa ({%pāñcālānāṃ ca mādhava /%}
{%adyānṛṇyaṃ gamiṣyāmi%}) 8. 52. 5, 28; as
desired by Karṇa, Śalya drove his chariot
towards Pāñcālas; entering their army,
Śalya stopped Karṇa's chariot wherever
he desired; seeing Karṇa's chariot, the
Pāñcālas trembled ({%trastā āsan%}); when
Karṇa killed Pāñcālas a loud cry arose
among them ({%tatrākrando mahān āsīt%});
although the great Pāñcāla archers were
defeated, they returned to fight till death
({%mṛtyuṃ kṛtvā nivartanam%}); Karṇa killed
twentyfive chariot-fighters and more than
hundred horse-riders; the wonderful
heroism of Pāñcālas was witnessed by
others when Pāñcālas did not abandon
fighting although they were getting killed
({%tatrādbhutam apaśyāma pāñcālānāṃ%}
{%parākramam / vadhyamānāpi karṇena%}
{%nājahū raṇamūrdhani //%}); two sons (not
named) of Karṇa killed strong Pāñcālas
8. 56. 8-11, 23, 31, 47, 49, 54, 56; but
at one stage Pāñcālas, afraid of Karṇa,
began to flee ({%ete dravanti pāñcālāḥ karṇāt%}
{%trastā … %}) 8. 57. 3; Karṇa rushed towards
Pāñcālas in spite of Arjuna ({%paśyataḥ%}
{%savyasācinaḥ%}); he killed Pāñcālas by releas-
ing thousands of arrows; there was fierce
battle of Karṇa with Pāñcālas who were
getting killed while fighting for the sake
of their allies ({%vadhyatāṃ sūtaputreṇa%}
{%mitrārthe 'mitraghātināṃ%}) 8. 59. 42, 44-45;
Karṇa scattered away Pāñcāla princes
({%? pāñcālaputrān%}); Karṇa was making the
Pāṇḍava army devoid of Pāñcālas ({%apāñcā-%}
[Page778-b+ 40]
{%lyaṃ kriyate%}); then five senior Pāñcāla
chariot-fighters, Uttamaujas and others,
attacked Karṇa but were not able to fell
down Karṇa from his chariot; all of them
were hit by Karṇa with arrows after he cut
off their bows and banners and killed their
horses and chariots; all of them were
defeated by Karṇa; when they were rescued
by Draupadī's sons and Sātyaki, the five
chariot-fighters got other chariots and, well-
armed, they rallied round Sātyaki to
protect him 8. 60. 1, 10, 15-17, 21-22, 26;
Karṇa tormented Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālas
by the lustre of his missiles ({%pratāpya%}
{% … astratejasā%}), but was thoroughly paci-
fied by the lustre of Arjuna (i. e. by
his missiles) ({%saṃśāntaḥ pārthatejasā%})
8. 68. 43; Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas honour-
ed Arjuna when Karṇa was killed 8. 69.
37; (58) In the evening of the seven-
teenth day Duryodhana told Śalya that
when he would be on the battle-field
Pāñcālas would give up all effort ({%nirudya-%}
{%māḥ%}) 9. 5. 24; Śalya, when chosen by
Duryodhana to lead his army, assured him
that he would kill all Pāñcālas in battle:
“let them see in battle my heroism, strength
of my arms and bow, my skill and power
of my missiles” ({%vikramaṃ mama paśyantu%}
{%dhanuṣaś ca mahad balam / lāghavaṃ%}
{%cāstravīryaṃ ca bhujayoś ca balaṃ yudhi //%})
9. 6. 11, 13-14; after listening to Kṛṣṇa's
advice, Yudhiṣṭhira permitted all Pāñcālas
to leave and he slept that night freed of
all care; all Pāñcālas too, delighted at
Karṇa's death, slept (happily) that night
9. 6. 38-40; (59) On the eighteenth day,
the victorious Pāñcālas went to the battle-
field 9. 7. 42; seeing Śalya's heroism, Duryo-
dhana felt Pāñcālas, Sṛṃjayas and Pāṇḍa-
[Page779-a+ 40]
vas as good as dead 9. 12. 28; having
heard Yudhiṣṭhira's vow to kill Śalya, all
Pāñcālas felt delighted; they blew conches,
beat {%bheris%} and {%puṣkaras%} by hundreds and
made loud roar in anticipation of the ful-
filment of the vow ({%tataḥ praharṣaḥ … punar%}
{%āsīt … pāñcālānāṃ … pratijñām tāṃ ca saṃ-%}
{%grāme dharmarājasya pūrayan%}) 9. 15. 27-
28; Pāñcālas and others, angered by Śalya's
killing their army, surrounded him 9. 16. 6;
when the Madra army, incited by Duryo-
dhana, entered the Pāṇḍava army, Pāñcālas
and others surrounded Yudhiṣṭhira wishing
his safety ({%yudhiṣṭhiraṃ parīpsantaḥ%});
Madra warriors shouted: “where are the
great warriors of Pāñcālas ({%pāñcālānāṃ%}
{%mahāvīryāḥ%}) 9. 17. 8, 13; when the Kau-
rava army fled after the death of Śalya,
Pāñcālas, desirous of victory, persecuted
them; seeing the Kaurava army, oppressed
by fear, running away, Pāñcālas and
Pāṇḍavas spoke to each other about the
victory of Yudhiṣṭhira and the defeat of
Duryodhana 9. 18. 11, 13-14; seeing Śālva's
heroism, Pāñcālas raised cries of despair
({%hāhākārair nādayantaḥ%}) and surrounded
his elephant 9. 19. 21; hearing the loud
roar of delighted Kauravas ({%siṃhanādaḥ%}
{%prahṛṣṭānāṃ … %}), Pāñcālas were dejected;
when Kṛtavarman and Sātyaki were engaged
in a duel, Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālas acted as
spectators ({%prekṣakāḥ samapadyanta%});
when Kaurava army started running away
at the defeat of Kṛtavarman, Duryodhana
attacked Pāñcālas and halted them with
arrows 9. 20. 6-7, 11, 33-34; Pāṇḍavas,
helped by Pāñcālas, stopped the advance of
Kurus and killed their seven hundred
chariot-fighters; Yudhiṣṭhira asked Saha-
deva to kill Śakuni; he himself, along with
[Page779-b+ 40]
Pāñcālas, would guard the division of
chariots ({%rathānīkam ahaṃ rakṣye%}) 9. 22.
14, 34; (60) Aśvatthāman left the army of
Pāñcāla king ({%pāñcālarājasya tad anīkam,%}
i. e. Pāñcālas) and went to Śakuni 9. 24.
42; (61) Aśvatthāman assured Duryo-
dhana, who had hid himself in water, that
he would that very day kill all Pāñcālas,
or else he would not remove his armour; on
learning the whereabouts of Duryodhana,
when Pāṇḍavas started towards the lake,
the delighted Pāñcālas raised a loud roar
({%kilakilāśabdaḥ prādurāsīd … %}); those
Pāñcālas who survived the war of eighteen
days followed Pāṇḍavas to the lake ({%pāñ-%}
{%cālānāṃ ca ye śiṣṭāḥ%}) 9. 29. 21, 46, 52:
Duryodhana even in that condition wished
to destroy the enthusiasm of Pāñcālas 9. 30.
43; Duryodhana was not afraid of either
Pāṇḍavas or Pāñcālas; with mace in his
hand he was confident to defeat them in
battle; equipped with mace, he appeared
to Pāñcālas like Indra with his {%vajra%} or
Śiva with his {%śūla;%} Pāñcālas and other
Pāṇḍava warriors clapped each other's
palms ({%anyonyasya talān daduḥ%}); Duryo-
dhana considered that to be his insult;
angered, he said that he would send Pāṇḍa-
vas and Pāñcālas to the abode of Yama
9. 31. 13, 30, 40-44; Pāñcālas welcomed
the decision of Bhīma to fight with Duryo-
dhana and kill him ({%tad vaco bhīmasena-%}
{%sya sarva evābhyapūjayan%}) 9. 32. 27; hear-
ing Duryodhana's challenging words, they
also applauded him ({%saṃpūjayām āsus%}
{%tad vacaḥ%}) 9. 32. 50; seeing the bad omens
which occurred at the time of the down-
fall of Duryodhana, Pāñcālas were dejected
({%āvignamanasaḥ%}) 9. 57. 57; they were not
very happy when Balarāma, displeased
[Page780-a+ 40]
with the way Duryodhana was made to
lie low, left for Dvārakā ({%nātipramanaso%}
{%'bhavan%}) 9. 59. 27; when Duryodhana
fell down, Pāñcālas, delighted ({%prahṛṣṭa-%}
{%manasaḥ%}), threw up their upper garments
and made roaring sounds; some expressed
their joy by stretching their bows, others
by sounding bow-strings; some blew big
conches and still others beat {%dundubhis;%}
some made sportive gestures and laughed
({%cikrīḍuś ca tathaivānye jaharṣuś ca%}); they
said many things in praise of Bhīmasena
9. 60. 3-16; hearing that, Kṛṣṇa rebuked
them 9. 60. 17-18; hearing Kṛṣṇa's words
reassuring Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālas for the
means they adopted to defeat Kauravas,
Pāñcālas were very much delighted; they
roared like herds of lions ({%bhṛśasaṃhṛṣṭā%}
{%vineduḥ siṃhasaṃghavat%}); Aśvatthāman
assured Duryodhana that he would kill
all Pāñcālas with all sorts of means in the
very presence of Kṛṣṇa ({%sarvopāyair hi%}
{%neṣyāmi pretarājaniveśanam%}) 9. 64. 35;
(a reference to this incident in 1. 2. 180);
(62) References to what happened during
the night of the eighteenth day are found
at the beginning of the Śalyaparvan: (i)
Vaiśaṃpāyana told Janamejaya that during
that night the three heroes on the side of
Kauravas who survived the war ({%hataśiṣṭās%}
{%trayo rathāḥ%}) killed the entire Pāñcāla
army; that was told by Saṃjaya to Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra 9. 1. 13, 30; (ii) Dhṛtarāṣṭra remem-
bered that Duryodhana had assured him
that he would kill all Pāñcālas; he then
asked Saṃjaya to tell him how all Pāñcā-
las, together with foot-soldiers, were killed
({%pāñcālāś ca yathā sarve nihatāḥ sapadā-%}
{%nugāḥ%}) 9. 2. 22, 63; (63) In the night
of the eighteenth day Aśvatthāman re-
[Page780-b+ 40]
solved to kill Pāñcālas when they were
asleep; he told Kṛpa that Pāñcālas, tired
due to exertion, would sleep that night
delightfully, trustfully, feeling themselves
victorious, unyoking their horses and keep-
ing away their armours; he would storm
Pāñcālas in their camp to kill them with his
sword and then get peace of mind; he would
repay the debt he owed to his father by
killing Pāñcālas; by killing the Pāñcāla army
at night he will have done his duty and
feel happy 10. 1. 53; 10. 3. 25, 28-32, 34-
35; earlier when Bhīma had stepped on
Duryodhana's head, Pāñcālas growled,
laughed, blew conches and sounded
{%dundubhis%} 10. 1. 58-59; Kṛpa told Aśva-
tthāman that they should kill Pāñcālas next
day in battle; Aśvatthāman was quite
capable of defeating the Pāñcāla army while
fighting with them; they would return
from the battle-field only after killing the
wretched Pāñcālas or get themselves killed
10. 4. 4, 15, 18; but Aśvatthāman was un-
able to live even for a while since he had
heard Pāñcālas saying: “Droṇa was
killed”; they deserved to be killed by him
10. 4. 25-26; Kṛpa tried to dissuade Aśva-
tthāman by telling him that it would not
be proper to kill Pāñcālas when they were
trustfully asleep 10. 5. 11; but Aśvatthā-
man asked Kṛpa why he did not blame
Pāñcālas who had committed sin by not
following {%dharma%} and broken all norms
of life ({%evam adhārmikāḥ pāpāḥ pāñcālā%}
{%bhinnasetavaḥ%}); he had therefore decided
to kill them during their sleep 10. 5. 24-
25; Mahādeva told Aśvatthāman that he
formerly protected Pāñcālas only out of
regard for Kṛṣṇa; but now they were over-
powered by Kāla and did not deserve to live
[Page781-a+ 40]
({%abhibhūtās tu kālena naiṣām adyāsti%}
{%jīvitam%}) 10. 7. 63; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked
Saṃjaya whether Kṛpa and Kṛtavarman
did what was expected of them or
whether they were killed by Pāñcālas
10. 8. 4; when Aśvatthāman came out
of the camp, Kṛpa and Kṛtavarman told
him that they had killed Pāñcālas (when
they tried to escape) by thousands; Aśva-
tthāman told them that he had killed the
rest of the Pāñcālas in the camp 10. 8. 141,
150; after killing all Pāñcālas, the three
of them went to Duryodhana; they told
him that all Pāñcālas were killed by them
10. 9. 1, 9, 49; the killing of Pāñcālas
referred to earlier by Dhṛtarāṣṭra as a
disgusting and disgraceful act of Aśva-
tthāman and others 1. 1. 153; 1. 2. 181;
Kṛṣṇa consoled Yudhiṣṭhira by telling
him that Pāñcālas and their companions
({%pāñcālāś ca sahānugāḥ%}) were killed by
Mahādeva (and not by Aśvatthāman) 10.
18. 26; when Dhṛtarāṣṭra was on his way
to the battlefield, Aśvatthāman and others
told him and Gāndhārī that they had
killed Pāñcālas and others 11. 10. 12; (64)
When Yudhiṣṭhira started to meet Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra, Pāñcāla women present there,
followed him ({%saha pāñcālayoṣidbhir yās%}
{%tatrāsan samāgatāḥ%}) 11. 11. 4; (65)
When Pāñcāla and Kuru women saw their
husbands and relatives lying dead on the
battlefield they fell down from their
chariots; tired and helpless they were
almost deprived of their consciousness
({%śrāntānāṃ cāpy anāthānāṃ nāsīt kācana%}
{%cetanā%}) 11. 16. 13-15; Gāndhārī told Kṛṣṇa
that looking at the destruction of Kurus
and Pāñcālas, she burnt with grief 11. 16.
25; she asked him how was young Abhi-
[Page781-b+ 40]
manyu killed by many in the presence of
Pāṇḍavas and Pāñcālas 11. 20. 18; (66)
Yudhiṣṭhira told Kuntī that he was much
more grieved to learn the truth about
Karṇa's birth than by the death of Pāñcālas
and others ({%tataḥ śataguṇaṃ duḥkham%})
11. 27. 18-19; (67) Yudhiṣṭhira, repent-
ing after the war, said that Pāñcālas and
Kurus were no doubt killed; but those
of them who were not killed would, after
death, go to the lowest regions on account
of their (i. e. of both Pāñcālas and
Kurus) acts 12. 7. 20; Yudhiṣṭhira while
taking leave of Kuntī said that Pāñcālas
(i. e. their males) were very much depleted,
only their daughters remained ({%pañcālāḥ%}
{%subhṛśaṃ kṣīṇāḥ kanyāmātrāvaśeṣitāḥ%}); he
did not know who would establish their
line again, since most of them were redu-
ced to ashes by Droṇa and those who
survived were killed by Aśvatthāman at
night 15. 44. 32-33. {@D.@} Past event:

164. 88-89. {@E.@} Past events: (1) Bhṛgus
acted as priests in the sacrifices of Kṛtavīrya
(also cf. 13. 56. 2); he gave them corn
and wealth at the end of Soma sacrifices
({%dhānyena ca dhanena ca%}); after the death
of Kṛtavīrya, his kinsmen, when in need
of money, asked eminent Bhṛgus to give it
since they knew Bhṛgus had wealth; some
Bhṛgus, afraid of Kṣatriyas, parted with
their wealth, but others hid it underground;
when one of the kings was digging the
ground he, by chance, found wealth in the
house of a Bhṛgu; the assembled Kṣatriyas,
due to anger, disregarded the supplications
of the Bhṛgus and killed them all with
sharp arrows; they killed even children,
yet unborn ({%ā garbhād anukṛntantaś … %})
(also cf. 13. 56. 3); when Bhṛgus were thus
being extirpated their wives took shelter
in mountain Himavant; one of them held
her embryo in her thigh for the conti-
nuation of the line of her husband ({%tāsām%}
{%anyatamā garbhaṃ bhayād dādhāra taija-%}
{%sam / ūruṇaikena vāmorūr bhartur kula-%}
{%vivṛddhaye //%}); when the embryo came out
[Page811-b+ 40]
breaking the thigh he deprived the Kṣatrī-
yas of their eyesight; the Kṣatriyas begged
pardon of the Bhṛgu wife 1. 169. 11-22;
the Bhṛgupatnī told the Kṣatriyas that she
had not deprived them of their eyesight;
that was done by the angry Bhārgava
(Aurva); since the Kṣatriyas started killing
even the unborn Bhṛgus she had held her
embryo in the thigh for a hundred years;
in order to do a favour to the Bhṛgu line-
age, the entire Veda along with the six
Vedāṅgas entered her child even when he
was unborn; the child angered by the death
of his ancestors (Bhṛgus) at the hands of
Kṣatriyas had deprived them of their
eyesight and wished to kill them 1. 170.
1-5; Aurva told the Kṣatriyas born in
the lineage of Kṛtavīrya that while he
was in the thigh of his mother he had
heard the cry of his mothers ({%ārāvaṃ%}
{%mātṛvargasya bhṛgūṇāṃ%}) due to the
killings of Kṣatriya; he was angered
because the wretched Kṣatriyas killed
Bhṛgus not sparing even those unborn;
when nobody offered shelter to the wives
of Bhṛgus due to fear, one of them had
concealed him in her thigh (1. 171. 5, 6, 8);
Aurva practised severe penance to take
revenge of the Bhṛgus who were killed
by destroying the worlds; he thought he
would delight the dead Bhṛgus ({%icchann%}
{%apacitiṃ kartuṃ bhṛgūṇāṃ bhṛgusattamaḥ%}
1. 170. 11; Nī., however, on Bom. Ed. 1.
179. 10: {%ātmano manaḥ sarveṣāṃ apacitiṃ%}
{%kartuṃ pravaṇaṃ unmukhaṃ icchan sva-%}
{%manopacitiṃ kartuṃ yojayatīty arthaḥ%});
the dead Bhṛgus then descended from the
world of Fathers ({%pitṛlokād upāgamya%})
and asked him to control his anger; they
assured him that the Bhṛgus disregarded
[Page812-a+ 40]
their getting killed by Kṣatriyas not because
of their weakness; they preferred getting
killed by Kṣatriyas because they themselves
were tired of their long life ({%āyuṣā hi%}
{%prakṛṣṭena yadā naḥ kheda āviśat / tadā-%}
{%smābhir vadhas tāta kṣatriyair īpsitaḥ%}
{%svayam //%}); some one hid wealth in the
house of a Bhṛgu in order to anger Kṣatri-
yas; Bhṛgus desired heaven, and had no
longing for wealth, however, death was
powerless to overtake Bhṛgus and suicide
would deprive them from getting good
worlds; hence they found some other way
out (to get killed by Kṣatriyas); what
Aurva had wanted to achieve by the
exercise of his penance was not approved
by Bhṛgus; so they asked him to desist
from doing the sinful act of destroying
the worlds 1. 170. 11-21; (2) Cyavana
told Kuśika the above account and added
that due to the energy of Bhṛgus ({%bhṛgū-%}
{%ṇām eva tejasā%}) in his dynasty his grand-
son would be an ascetic Brāhmaṇa ({%vipra%}
for {%vipraḥ ?%}) having the lustre of fire; he
also told him that a matrimonial alliance
would be established between him (Kuśi-
ka's line) and the Bhṛgus ({%bhavitā tvaṃ%}

13. 56. 1-14); ({%bhṛgūṇāṃ kuśikānāṃ ca%}

Rāma Jāmadagnya filled at Samantapañ-

they were therefore able to control their
enemies and give delight to their friends

army was routed by Aśvatthāman, Arjuna
supported by Matsyas faced Kauravas 7.
172. 3; (34) On the sixteenth day, Matsyas
and the rest surrounded Karṇa with their
chariots, horses, elephants and valorous
foot-soldiers and struck him with various
weapons; bent on killing Karṇa they spoke
harsh words to him ({%bhāṣanto vāgbhir%}
{%ugrābhiḥ sarve karṇavadhe vṛtāḥ%}) 8. 21. 26-

22; Matsyas and others, protected by
Arjuna were able to reduce the army of
Kauravas ({%kṛtaḥ śatrugaṇakṣayaḥ%}) 8. 51.
6; Kṛṣṇa remembered that earlier in the
war, Bhīṣma had killed Matsyas with
arrows 8. 51. 27; when Matsyas were gett-

Karṇa and afflicted him with arrows
({%śarasaṃghaiḥ samārdayan%}); but Karṇa

he killed their chariot-fighters by thousands
along with their charioteers, horses, ele-
phants and foot-soldiers 8. 40. 69, 71-73;

attacked them; Madras, with the wheels
of their chariots and flag-staffs broken,
were killed by Pāṇḍavas 9. 17. 12, 14-
15; when they again rushed at Pāṇḍavas,
Duryodhana tried to pacify them urging
them to return; but no one listened to him
9. 17. 16-17; Śakuni blamed Duryodhana

very presence of Kaurava heroes; he
reminded him that Kurus and Madras
had decided to fight together ({%sahitair nāma%}

17-20; when Duryodhana complained that
[Page826-a+ 40]
the Madra warriors did not listen to him
when he tried to check them, Śakuni told
him that angered fighters do not obey the
orders of their seniors; that was not the
time either to get angry with Madras or
neglect them ({%alaṃ kroddhuṃ tathalteṣāṃ%}
{%nāyaṃ kāla upekṣitum%}); he advised Duryo-

Madra warriors fighting, attacked them;
in the battle that ensued Madras were
killed 9. 17. 25-28; the battle described

they raised sound and attacked Pāṇḍavas
who showered arrows and killed the
army of Śalya; seeing that, Duryo-

again blamed them and pointed out that
the Madra army consisting of ten thousand
horses and fighting with bright lances had
fought heroically and brought about great
destruction of the enemies ({%anīkaṃ daśa-%}

Different Origins: (1) In the bygone
days, the sages churned the right thigh
of king Vena whom they had killed;
from it arose a dwarfish person ({%hrasvā-%}
{%ṅgaḥ%}); him, the sages said ‘sit down’
({%niṣīda%}); from him were born Niṣādas
and other Mlecchas in hundreds and
thousands living on Vindhya mountain

[Page841-a+ 40]
produced by Nandinī, Vasiṣṭha's cow, from
her foam; they and other peoples produced
by Nandinī formed a large army; they wore
different armours and held different wea-

After the war was over, while Saṃjaya
was reporting events of the eighteenth
day to Dhṛtarāṣṭra, the latter remembered
that once the whole earth, including
the Mlecchas and Āṭavikas was sustained
due to the graciousness of Duryodhana
({%iyaṃ ca pṛthivī sarvā samlechāṭavikā … /%}

Saṃjaya in his account listed Mlecchas
among those who were killed in the great
war ({%mlecchāś ca … nipātitāḥ%}) 9. 1. 26;
Dhṛtarāṣṭra remembered that Duryodhana,
before the war, counted Mlecchas among
those who, in thousands, were ready
to fight and give up their lives for him;
it was with their support that he was
going to fight with Pāṇḍavas ({%mlecchāś%}

{@B.@} Their history: (1) Yāyāvaras were the
forefathers of Jaratkāru; he once saw
them hanging with their heads down and
holding on to a bunch of grass; a mouse
residing in a hole was slowly eating up
that bunch of grass; Jaratkāru addressed
them; he pitied their plight for they were
without food, were lean, pitiable, affli-
cted and waiting for help; he showed his
readiness to help them by offering them
the fourth, the third, the half, of his
austerities, or even all of them; Yāyāvaras
told him that they were falling down in
the impure hell because of the non-
continuation of their line ({%saṃtāna-%}
{%prakṣaya%}); his austerities would not
help them; they told him they were sages
known as Yāyāvaras, they had fallen
down from the holy world due to the
discontinuation of their line ({%saṃtāna-%}
{%prakṣaya%}); their austerities had come to an
end; there was no one to continue their line;
the only one, named Jaratkāru, was as good
[Page851-a+ 40]
as nothing for this purpose; he was versed
in the Vedas but had not married and had
no progeny; hence they were hanging head
down in the ditch; if ever the person to
whom they were addressing met Jaratkāru
he should tell him their plight, ask him to
marry and beget progeny; the bunch of
grass to which they were clinging was
their only support; if they fell down along
with their ancestors, Jaratkāru too would
fall down into the hell; neither austerities,
nor sacrifices, nor any thing else was equal
to a child 1. 41. 3-30; 1. 13. 10-30; Jarat-
kāru then disclosed his identity to Yāyā-
varas and asked them to punish him; they
told him that fortunately he had come
there and asked him the reason of his not
marrying; Jaratkāru told them that by ob-
serving celibacy he wanted to take his body
to the next world ({%ūrdhvaretāḥ śarīraṃ vai%}
{%prāpayeyam amutra vai%}); however now that
he had seen their plight he had decided to
marry provided he found a maiden having
his name and also if he was not required to
support her ({%sanāmnīṃ yady ahaṃ kanyām%}
{%upalapsye kadācana … na bhareyaṃ ca%}
{%yām aham%}); Jaratkāru did not get a
maiden since he was old; dejected he went
to the forest and addressed all beings,
moving and not moving, and even those
concealed, telling them that Yāyāvaras had
asked him to marry and so he requested
them to give him a maiden who bore his
name and whom he was not required to
support 1. 42. 1-15; when Jaratkāru's
conditions were fulfilled, he married; when
Āstīka was born, he saved Yāyāvaras and
took off great burden of his ancestors;
Jaratkāru went to heaven, along with his
ancestors ({%pitṝṃś ca tārayām āsa saṃtatyā%}

{%śatrūn suhṛdo nandayanti%}) 5. 28. 11; no one
in the past was or in the future would be
equal to Vṛṣṇis in strength; they did not
disregard kinsmen, were obedient to elders,
gods, Asuras, Gandharvas, Yakṣas, Rākṣa-
sas; men were unable to defeat Vṛṣṇi
warriors in battles: they did not rob Brāh-
maṇas, teachers, kinsmen of their wealth;
on the other hand, if any one of them was
in difficulty they protected him; they were
wealthy, but were not arrogant; truthful,
they were devoted to Brāhmaṇas; they did
not underrate the strong ones, they uplifted
the weak ones; they worshipped gods, were
controlled and generous, but not given to
boasting; due to these virtues Vṛṣṇi warriors
were not attacked; one might carry moun-
tain Meru, cross the ocean, but not succeed
if he dared attack Vṛṣṇi warriors ({%na%}

gathered to see Arjuna when he arrived at
Dvārakā; Bhojas, Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas
honoured and greeted Arjuna; he paid his
respects to the deserving among them;
Vṛṣṇis, along with Bhojas and Andhakas
celebrated a grand festival in honour of
the Raivataka mountain; in that festival,
Vṛṣṇis and others gave gifts to thousands
of Brāhmaṇas; thousands of illustrious
youths of Vṛṣṇis put on ornaments and
moved about riding vehicles decorated with
gold; their wives and followers accompani-
ed them 1. 211. 1-2, 5-6; (6) On hearing
[Page867-a+ 40]
the sound of the drum sounded by the
guardian of the Sabhā, agitated Vṛṣṇis and
Andhakas, leaving aside food and drink,
assembled by hundreds in the Sabhā and
took their seats on the {%siṃhāsanas;%} the
Sabhāpāla told them that Arjuna had ab-
ducted Subhadrā; on hearing it they leaped
up from their seats and asked their chari-
oteers to yoke the chariots and bring their
weapons, bows and armours; others brought
forth their gold-decked horses; when all
these arrangements were being done there
arose a confused sound of the Vṛṣṇi
heroes 1. 212. 12-19; Bhojas, Vṛṣṇis and
Andhakas got ready to follow Balarāma
when he announced his intention to fight
with Arjuna ({%anvapadyanta te sarve bhoja-%}
{%vṛṣṇyandhakās tadā%}) 1. 212. 31-32; Vṛṣṇis
made their intention to attack Arjuna
known several times; but when Kṛṣṇa told
them that Arjuna had done the right thing,
they were pacified 1. 213. 2-11; Kṛṣṇa with
Vṛṣṇis and others went to the Khāṇḍava-
prastha to attend the marriage of Subhadrā
with Arjuna; they took with them large
number of nuptial gifts ({%haraṇaṃ bahu%});
they were received by Nakula and Saha-
deva; the illustrious Vṛṣṇis ({%vṛṣṇicakraṃ%}

Yudhiṣṭhira received the seniors among
Vṛṣṇis with honours according to the rules
and following the actual practice (?) ({%prati-%}

them bright jewels given to them by
Kurus 1. 213. 52-56; (7) Vṛṣṇi princes
({%vṛṣṇīnāṃ … kumārā … %}) were among those

4. 26; (8) They were taught the science
of archery by Arjuna ({%kumārā … vṛṣṇi-%}

from Mathurā and settled down at Kuśa-
sthalī in the west; they fortified the new
settlement in such a way as to make it
difficult to be captured even by gods; even
women could fight and hold it against
the attack ({%striyo 'pi yasyāṃ yudhyeyuḥ%}

Vṛṣṇis lived there without fear from any

they had allied themselves with Pāṇḍavas
because of their relationship ({%sāmarthya-%}

17. 27; (11) Vṛṣṇis arrived at Khāṇḍava-
prastha for the Rājasūya of Yudhiṣṭhira
[Page868-a+ 40]
2. 31. 16; (12) Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas
did not pay tribute to Yudhiṣṭhira for
Rājasūya because of their friendly relations
with Pāṇḍavas ({%sakhyenāndhakavṛṣṇayaḥ%})
2. 48. 42; however, Vārṣṇeyas are said to
have brought for Yudhiṣṭhira many kinds
of tribute ({%vārṣṇeyān hārahūṇāṃś ca%}

along with Cīnas, Hūṇas, Śakas, Oḍras,
forest-dwellers, and Hārahūṇas, are these
Vārṣṇeyas different from Vṛṣṇis who formed
a section of the Yādavas and did not pay
tribute ?): (13) Śiśupāla instigated the
kings assembled for the Rājasūya to fight
with Vṛṣṇis and Pāṇḍavas 2. 36. 14; (14)
Vidura warned Kauravas that Vṛṣṇis would
never forgive the hardship suffered by Drau-
padī in the Sabhā ({%tasyāḥ … parikleśaṃ%}

2. 72. 29; (15) Hearing that Pāṇḍavas
had gone into exile, Vṛṣṇis, Bhojas, and
Andhakas went to meet them in the
Dvaitavana (3. 12. 68); they sat around
Yudhiṣṭhira, blamed Kauravas and won-
dered what they could do (to help them)
3. 13. 1, 3-4; (16) Draupadī complained
to Kṛṣṇa that Kauravas had desired to
reduce her to the status of a {%dāsī%} although
Vṛṣṇis were alive ({%dāsībhāvena bhoktuṃ%}

Śālva attacked Dvārakā in the absence of
Kṛṣṇa, young Vṛṣṇi heroes fought with him
({%bālakair vṛṣṇipuṃgavaiḥ%}); Śālva killed
many of the excellent Vṛṣṇi heroes ({%vṛṣṇi-%}
{%pravīrāṃs tān bālān hatvā%}) 3. 15. 6-7;
during Śālva's attack on Dvārakā drinking
[Page868-b+ 40]
liquor was prohibited; Vṛṣṇis and Andha-
kas had to remain alert apprehending
Śālva might attack them when they were
drunk ({%pramatteṣv abhighātaṃ hi kuryāt%}
{% … iti kṛtvāpramattās te sarve vṛṣṇy-%}

the town without valid permit ({%na cāmudro%}

Vṛṣṇi princes saw Śālva's army attacking
Dvārakā, they came out and fought with
the opponents ({%kumārā vṛṣṇinandanāḥ%})
3. 17. 8; when Pradyumna swooned, the
army of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas raised a
cry of grief; when Pradyumna regained
consciousness he blamed his charioteer for
removing his chariot away from the battle-
field for that was not the battle-{%dharma%}
of Vṛṣṇ warriors ({%naiṣa vṛṣṇipravīrāṇām%}
{%āhave dharma ucyate%}) 3. 19. 1-2, 5; he
told the charioteer that one who left the
battlefield was not born in the family of
Vṛṣṇis ({%na sa vṛṣṇikule jāto yo vai tyajati%}
{%saṃgaram%}), nor he who killed one fallen
on the ground or who had surrendered,
or a woman, an old man or a child, or
one who was without a chariot, who was
shattered, and whose weapons were broken;
he reminded the charioteer that he (the
charioteer) knew what the {%dharma%} of
Vṛṣṇis was in battles, and since he knew
the entire code of conduct of Vṛṣṇis en-
gaged in fighting he should not have taken
Pradyumna away form battlefield; ({%dhar-%}

[Page869-a+ 40]
say to him when he met them 3. 19. 21;
Pradyumna asked his charioteer how he
could face Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis who
always vied with him ({%mayā spardhanti%}
{%satataṃ%}) 3. 19. 28; the charioteer in reply
told Pradyumna that he was conversant
with the war (conduct) of Vṛṣṇis (and
he defended his action) ({%yuddhajñaś cāsmi%}
{%vṛṣṇīnām%}) 3. 20. 2; Śālva tormented by
Vṛṣṇis rode his Saubha to rise up in
the sky and left Dvārakā 3. 20. 27; when
Kṛṣṇa returned to Dvārakā he was sur-
prised to see the town of Vṛṣṇis with men
and women extremely uneasy ({%asvastha-%}
{%naranārīkam idaṃ vṛṣṇipuraṃ bhṛśam%}) 3.
21. 4; Kṛṣṇa then spoke to Āhuka, Vasu-
deva and Vṛṣṇi heroes asking them to
remain alert ({%apramādaḥ sadā kāryo%}); he
announced his decision to attack Śālva
which delighted Vṛṣṇis; comforted, they
asked him to kill the enemies and blessed
him 3. 21. 7-11; (18) Dhṛtarāṣṭra feared
that Vṛṣṇi archers and spirited Pāñcālas,
led by Kṛṣṇa, would burn the army of
Kauravas 3. 48. 6; he told Saṃjaya that
it was not possible even for mountains
to withstand the velocity (of the attack)
of Vṛṣṇis when led by Rāma and Kṛṣṇa
({%vṛṣṇīnām … /na śakyaḥ sahituṃ vegaḥ%})
3. 48. 7; (19) When Vṛṣṇis went to
Prabhāsa to meet the Pāṇḍavas during
the period of their exile, they found
them smeared with dirt resting on bare
ground; seeing them, Vṛṣṇis were filled
with sorrow and cried loudly; Yudhiṣṭhira
approached Vṛṣṇis and honoured them as
they deserved; they too in return honoured
Pāṇḍavas and sat around them 3. 118. 15,
18-21; Janamejaya asked Vaiśaṃpāyana to
tell him the details of the talks between
[Page869-b+ 40]
Vṛṣṇis, sitting around, and Pāṇḍavas at
Prabhāsa 3. 119. 1-3; Sātyaki suggested to
Balarāma that he should permit the army
of Daśārhas to march against Duryodhana
so that he would perish when overtaken
by the army of Vṛṣṇis; he also said that
the army consisting of principal Kṣatriya
warriors of Vṛṣṇis, Bhojas and Andhakas
should kill the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra and
enhance its fame ({%kṣatriyaśūrasenā loke%}
{%yaśaḥ sphītam upākarotu%}) 3. 120. 5, 19;
(20) Kṛṣṇa told Draupadī that her
sons while they were in the town of
Vṛṣṇis (Dvārakā) they were not jealous
of gods ({%tavātmajā vṛṣṇipuraṃ praviśya%}
{%na daivatebhyaḥ spṛhayanti kṛṣṇe%}) 3. 180.
25; Satyabhāmā assured Draupadī that
Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis had the same affec-
tion for her sons as for Pradyumna 3. 224.
14; (21) Draupadī warned Jayadratha
that if he insisted on abducting her, Vṛṣṇi
heroes led by Kṛṣṇa, would chase him
({%vṛṣṇivīrā … padavīṃ careyuḥ%}) 3. 252. 16

Abhimanyu 4. 67. 14, 24; Vṛṣṇis, Andhakas
and Bhojas returned to Dvārakā after the
marriage 5. 7. 1; (23) Saṃjaya advised
Yudhiṣṭhira that it was more beneficial for
him to live by begging in the kingdom of
Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas than get back the
kingdom by resorting to war ({%bhaikṣya-%}

followed him ({%pṛṣṭhato 'nuyayuḥ%}); when
he entered the Sabhā they walked behind

lived happily together when the Yādavas
abandoned Kaṃsa in the interest of the

he was not alone in the Sabhā; Andhakas

laughed to show the great miracle ({%mahad%}

Dhṛtarāṣṭra that Pāṇḍavas, Vṛṣṇis and
others would blame him for the confusion
in his mind ({%te buddhivyabhīcāram upa-%}

Sātyaki, had told him in Dvaitavana that
he would need Sātyaki's help even though
Vṛṣṇis, led by Kṛṣṇa, were ready to help him
7. 85. 54, 58-60; Bhūriśravas wondered how
Arjuna could look upon Vṛṣṇis and Andha-

authority (while deciding what was proper
or improper in war) ({%prakṛtyaiva vigar-%}

During the night war (14th-15th day),
Karṇa assured Duryodhana that he would
defeat Vṛṣṇis and the rest 7. 133. 11; after
the death of Droṇa, Sātyaki told Dhṛṣṭa-
dyumna that he deserved to be expelled
(from the war) by Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis
since he did a vile act and yet praised
himself ({%yāpyas tvam asi … sarvaiś cāpy-%}

Pāṇḍavas 7. 169. 48-49; Pāñcālas too
had no friends better than Pāṇḍavas and
Vṛṣṇis 7. 169. 50; (44) On the fifteenth
day, when the Pāṇḍava army was being
burnt by the Nārāyaṇāstra, Yudhiṣṭhira
advised Sātyaki to leave the battle-field
along with Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas 7. 170.

night ({%niśi%} 8. 1. 25), Dhṛtarāṣṭra while
lamenting the death of Karṇa, told Saṃjaya

Dvārakā where he was highly honoured by
Vṛṣṇis ({%vṛṣṇibhiḥ paramārcitaḥ%}) 10. 12. 11;
Kṛṣṇa told Aśvatthāman that he was never
before requested to part with his {%cakra%} by

While repenting the loss of life in war,
Yudhiṣṭhira said to Arjuna that if Pāṇḍa-

beg in the town of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas
they would not have killed the males in the

Arjuna that a very long time had elapsed
since he was with Baladeva and other Vṛṣṇi
chiefs in Dvārakā ({%vṛṣṇipuṃgavān%}) and he
would therefore like to return to Dvārakā
14. 15. 20; Arjuna assured him that he
would soon meet them; Yudhiṣṭhira re-
quested Kṛṣṇa to return to Hāstinapura
for the Aśvamedha after meeting Vṛṣṇis 14.
51. 23, 46; (52) When Kṛṣṇa returned
[Page872-a+ 40]
to Dvārakā, Vṛṣṇi heroes were celebrating
the festival of the Raivataka mountain
({%vihāro vṛṣṇivīrāṇām mahe raivatakasya%}

Vṛṣṇis received Kṛṣṇa on the Raivataka;
Kṛṣṇa honoured them and enquired about
the welfare of Vṛṣṇis who sat around him

Kṛṣṇa, along with Vṛṣṇis, went to Hāstina-

Vṛṣṇi chiefs ({%vṛṣṇiśārdūlāḥ%}) gave Uttarā
many jewels as gift; when Pāṇḍavas arrived
at the place where Parikṣit was born,
Vṛṣṇi chiefs ({%vṛṣṇipuṃgavāḥ%}) came out
to welcome them (14. 69. 8-9, 13);
Pāṇḍavas, along with Vṛṣṇis ({%vṛṣṇibhiḥ%}

arrived, Kuru chiefs (Pāṇḍavas) sat near
him along with Vṛṣṇi and Andhaka
heroes ({%saha vṛṣṇyandhakavyāghraiḥ%}) 14.

went to Dvāravatī which was protected by
Vṛṣṇi heroes ({%vṛṣṇivīra-%}) 14. 84. 13; when
the horse sacrifice was in progress, Kṛṣṇa,
with Vṛṣṇis reached Hāstinapura 14. 88. 4;
(57) Yudhiṣṭhira told Kuntī that only the
[Page872-b+ 40]
Vṛṣṇi circle ({%vṛṣṇicakram%}) had survived
the war due to the favour of Kṛṣṇa 15. 44.

how were Andhakas, Vṛṣṇis and Bhojas
destroyed in the presence of Vāsudeva
and who pronounced the curse on them
due to which they perished 16. 2. 1, 3;
Vaiśaṃpāyana then told him that thirtysix
years (after the coronation of Yudhiṣṭhira)
Vṛṣṇis misbehaved and, as dictated by
Kāla, they killed each other with pestle;
the sages (Viśvāmitra, Kaṇva and Nārada)
pronounced a curse to the effect that Sāmba
would give birth to an iron pestle for the
destruction of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas ({%vṛṣṇy-%}
{%andhakavināśāya%}); that pestle would wipe
out the Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas who were ill-

happened, he told Vṛṣṇis that the curse
would prove true ({%bhavitavyaṃ tathā%}) 16.
2. 2, 8-9, 13; the next day Sāmba gave
birth to a pestle for the destruction of
Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas; when the matter was
reported to Ugrasena he prohibited fer-

Kāla constantly visited their houses; a
certain bald, fierce man surveyed their
houses and disappeared; day after day
strong winds blew to foretell the de-
struction of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas; day and
night, {%sārikās%} produced shrill, unceasing

sounds in the houses of Vṛṣṇis; pale pigeons
with red feet, inspired by Kāla, moved in
the houses of Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas; there
occurred many other bad omens; asses with
shrill voices responded to the sound pro-
duced by Pāñcajanya ({%evaṃ prayatamānā-%}

in general; women and men transgressed
rules of morality ({%patnyaḥ patīn vyucca-%}

that a black woman with white teeth,
laughing, ran around Dvārakā robbing
them and men dreamt that fierce demons
deprived them of their ornaments, {%chatras%}
flag-staffs and armours; the {%cakra%} given to
Kṛṣṇa by Agni rose up to the sky within
the sight of Vṛṣṇis ({%vṛṣṇīnāṃ paśyatām%});
the four horses took the chariot upwards

took with them eatables (meat) and drinks
(liquors) of different kinds and set out
of the city 16. 4. 6-8; (62) Vṛṣṇi and
Andhaka heroes, overpowered by Kāla,
saw Uddhava deserting them; Kṛṣṇa knew
the iminent destruction of Vṛṣṇis and
[Page873-b+ 40]
hence he did not object to Uddhava's
leaving Vṛṣṇis ({%kālaparītās te vṛṣṇy-%}

he would take with him the women of

children ({%vṛṣṇidārāṃs tu bālavṛddhāṃs%}

he would like to meet the ministers of

them dead and did whatever was necessary

({%kṣatriyāḥ%}) brought large amount of wealth

then were allowed to enter; the elephants
given by them are described in stanzas 2.
48. 15-20; Kṛṣṇa mentioned Śakas among
those whose kings, afraid of the lustre of
the weapons of Pāṇḍavas, acted as servers
at the Rājasūya sacrifice ({%śakān / … mahī-%}

Drupada asked Yudhiṣṭhira to send his
messengers to the kings of Śakas and others

Kāmboja Sudakṣiṇa came to Duryodhana
with an army of {%akṣauhiṇī%} fighters consi-
sting of Yavanas and Śakas; it looked like
a swarm of locusts ({%tasya senāsamāvāyaḥ%}
{%śalabhānām ivābabhau%}) 5. 19. 21-22;
Duryodhana's army consisted of different
peoples, Śakas being one of them; like the
army of gods it was difficult to be attacked
({%durādharṣāṃ devacamūprakāśām%}) 5. 158.
19-20; Śaka kings with their armies led
by Śakuni marched towards Kurukṣetra
in the second division of the Kaurava army
({%śakāḥ … dvitīye niryayur bale%}) 5. 196. 7;
there, on the battle-field, before the start of
the war, Kṛpa along with Śakas, Kirātas
and others protected the Kaurava army in
the north ({%camūm uttarato 'bhipāti%}) 6.
20. 13; (4) On the third day of the war,
[Page879-b+ 40]
the Kāmboja king along with the Śakas
was posted at the ‘tail’ ({%puccham āsan%}) of
the Garuḍavyūha (6. 52. 2) of Kauravas
6. 52. 7; (5) On the sixth day, Śakas,
Yavanas and others stood at the right wing
({%dakṣiṇam pakṣam āśritya%}) of the Krauñca-
vyūha (6. 71. 14) of the Kauravas 6. 71. 20;
(6) On the eleventh day, Śakas, Yavanas
and others riding swift horses stood at
the extreme end of the left wing ({%savyaṃ%}

{%mahāvegaiḥ%}) of the Śakaṭavyūha (7. 6. 15)

day, Dhṛtarāṣṭra, while recounting past
exploits of Kṛṣṇa remembered his victory
over hordes of enemies consisting of Āvan-
tyas and others who came from different
directions and joined the Śakas riding
horses (?) ({%āvantyān … nānādigbhyaś ca%}

note on the stanza Vol. IX. pp. 1144-1145:
{%ŚBr. (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa)%} appears to
use this word to signify ‘excrement of a
horse’! Here it seems to mean a particular
(disgusting ?) tribe of Śakas who were
horse-riders (cf. {#aSvapuruza#} in 6. 1. 7); (8)
On the twelfth day, Śakas were among
those who occupied the ‘neck’ ({%grīvāyām%})
of the Suparṇavyūha (7. 19. 4) of Kaura-
vas 7. 19. 7-8; (9) On the fourteenth
day, fierce Śakas, Yavanas and others
formed innumerable hordes in hundreds
and thousands ({%vrātāḥ śatasahasraśaḥ%}) to
attack Arjuna; he fought them with arrows
and cut them off with his skill in shooting
arrows ({%aśātayat … astramāyayā%}); afraid,
they all fled 7. 68. 41-45; (10) The same
day, Sātyaki expected to encounter them in
his onward march towards Arjuna ({%śakaiś%}
[Page880-a+ 39]
{%cāpi sameṣyāmi%}) 7. 87. 50; Sātyaki asked
his charioteer to drive his chariot to Śakas
and other Mlecchas who, riding chariots
and elephants and holding different kinds
of weapons in their hands, were eager to
fight with him ({%mām evābhimukhāḥ sarve%}
{%tiṣṭhanti samarārthinaḥ%}); Sātyaki was con-
fident to defeat them 7. 95. 13-14; in the
encounter that followed, Śakas and others
showered arrows on Sātyaki; he cut off
their arrows and killed them by thousands
covering the earth with their blood and
flesh; those who escaped death fled swiftly
in fright; Sātyaki thus defeated the large
army of Śakas 7. 95. 32-33, 38-39, 45;
three thousand horse-riders of Śakas and
others, led by Duryodhana, returned to
the battlefield to attack Sātyaki; he killed
many of them 7. 97. 13-14, 20; (11) On
the seventeenth day, Kāmbojas, Śakas and
Yavanas, led by Saṃśaptakas guarded the
extremity of the left side ({%vāmaṃ pārśvam%}
{%apālayan … teṣāṃ prapakṣaḥ%}) of the Bārha-
spatyavyūha (8. 31. 26) of Kauravas 8. 31.
14-15; in the course of that day, after the
death of the younger brother of Kāmboja
Sudakṣiṇa, there was fierce fighting ({%ghoram%}
{%adbhutadarśanam%}) in which Śakas riding
horses took part; a large number of them
were killed 8. 40. 107-110; later that day,
Kṛṣṇa in order to encourage Arjuna told him
that Śakas had joined the Kaurava army for

down and they honoured him mentally
({%pūjayām āsa śirasā manasā taiś ca pūji-%}
{%taḥ%}) 12. 325. 1-2; Bhagavān appeared
[Page895-b+ 40]
before Nārada, but told him to leave the
island immediately so that no disturbance
was caused to the contemplations of the
people of the Śvetadvīpa ({%gaccha nārada%}
{%māciram // … ekāgrāś cintayeyur māṃ%}
{%naiṣāṃ vighno bhaved iti%}) 12. 326. 17-18;
12. 331. 13; he left Śvetadvīpa and went
to mount Meru and from there to Gandha-
mādana to reach Badarī 12. 331. 20-22;
(also see the two epic events above);
Nārada told Nara and Nārāyaṇa that he
saw in Śvetadvīpa the people residing there
12. 331. 29-30; Nārāyaṇa asked Nārada if
he saw in Śvetadvīpa the Bhagavān who was
their (i. e. of Nara and Nārāyaṇa) higher
{%prakṛti (api … sa bhagavān … śvetadvīpe%}
{%tvayā dṛṣṭa āvayoḥ prakṛtiḥ parā)%} 12. 331.
35; Nārada replied that he did and also
told them he saw the white people who
were devoid of all sense-organs; as directed
by Bhagavān he returned from Śvetadvīpa
12. 331. 36, 41, 51; 12. 332. 1; Nara and
Nārāyaṇa then told Nārada that they too
had seen him (Nārada) meeting the Bhaga-
vān himself in Śvetadvīpa and had heard
his conversation with him ({%āvābhyām api%}
{%dṛṣṭas tvaṃ śvetadvīpe … /samāgato bhaga-%}
{%vatā saṃjalpaṃ kṛtavān yathā //%}) 12. 332.
22; (2) A noncorporeal voice told Ekata,
Dvita and Trita, who were practising severe
austerities on mountain Meru to go to
Śvetadvīpa where the Bhagavān had mani-
fested himself ({%gacchadhvaṃ tatra%}) (i. e.
Śvetadvīpa) {%munayas tatrātmā me pra-%}
{%kāśitaḥ%}) 12. 323. 21-23, 26; they reached
the Śvetadvīpa by following the way told
to them by the noncorporeal voice; having
reached the island, however, their eyes
were blinded and they could not see any
man ({%prāpya śvetaṃ mahādvīpaṃ … tato%}
[Page896-a+ 40]
{%no dṛṣṭiviṣayas tadā pratihato 'bhavat%}) 12.
323. 27-28; when Ekata, Dvita and Trita
further practised austerities for a hundred
years they were able to see the people of
the Śveta island; they had folded their
hands and, facing north-east, they did the
{%japa%} of Brahman; that {%japa%} was mental
({%nityāñjalikṛtān brahma japataḥ prāgudaṅ-%}
{%mukhān / mānaso nāma sa japo japyate%}
{%tair mahātmabhiḥ //%}) 12. 323. 32; suddenly
they saw lustre equal to that of a thousand
suns; the people of the island together be-
gan to run quickly, folding their hands and,
delighted, they continued to say {%‘namas’;%}
when they were thus showing their reve-
rence, we heard a loud sound ({%tato 'bhi-%}
{%vadatāṃ teṣām aśrauṣma vipulaṃ dhvanim%})
12. 323. 37; Ekata, Dvita and Trita were
not able to see anything, but they could
hear the praise of Bhagavān; at that time
wind blew heavenly flowers and plants
suitable for offerings; with that, people
gave offering to Hari ({%baliḥ kilopahriyate%}
{%tasya devasya tair naraiḥ%}); indeed, the god
himself had arrived there when they were
uttering sounds; from among those thou-
sands of men no one welcomed them
mentally, nor by looking at them; no one
thought of them and hence they were
worried ({%etasminn antare vāyuḥ … divyāny%}

a non-corporeal being then told them that
they had already seen the white people of
the island and that seeing them was as
good as seeing the chief god; they should
therefore quit the island without delay

{%deśam anuprāptā mama darśanalālasāḥ%})

by the white ascetics ({%dharmaḥ sātvato … /%}

was taken to Rāsātala by a {%kṛtyā%} that the
Saṃśaptakas were Daityas and Rākṣasas in
hundreds and thousands appointed to kill
Arjuna and they would kill him; then Dur-
yodhana felt assured that (Karṇa and) the
Saṃśaptakas were meant to kill Arjuna and
that they were capable of accomplishing
the task; the mind of the Saṃśaptakas was
under the spell of Rākṣasas and, overcome
by the qualities {%rajas%} and {%tamas,%} they were

{%yatra tena tatra%}); (5) Śuśarman, king of
Trigartas, and his five brothers Satyaratha,
Satyadharman, Satyavarman, Satyeṣuḥ and
Satyakarman together with their army of
Trigartas, as well as Mālavas, Tuṇḍikeras,
Mācellakas, Lalitthas, Madrakas and many
other Janapadas took the oath ({%śapatha%})
to kill Arjuna 7. 16. 11, 15-21; the mode of
oath, also called {%pratijñā,%} in which offerings
were given in fire, described 7. 16. 22-37;
in the description of the war, in the con-
text of Saṃśaptakas, besides some of those
groups of people mentioned above, also
occur Nārāyaṇas, Gopālas (7. 17. 31; 7. 18.
7), and Yaudheyas (7. 18. 16); (6) On
the twelfth day of the war, Droṇa planned a
battle between Arjuna and the Saṃśaptaka
troops and when Arjuna left the main battle-
field to fight with them, he arranged his
army in the Suparṇavyūha against Pāṇḍavas
({%vidhāya yogaṃ pārthena saṃśaptaka-%}
{%gaṇaiḥ saha%}) 7. 19. 2-4; the Saṃśaptakas
arranged their chariots on even ground
in the {%vyūha%} called Candrārdha; they were
delighted to see Arjuna approaching them
for a fight; they roared loudly; Arjuna was
surprised to find that they were delighted
when actually they should have been
grieved; or, he thought, perhaps, they were
delighted because they would go to excellent
worlds (after death) which were otherwise
difficult to be obtained by bad people 7.
17. 1-6; hearing the sound of Devadatta
conch blown by Arjuna, the army of
Saṃśaptakas became motionless; regaining
consciousness they started fighting with
Arjuna by showering {%kaṅkapatrin%} arrows
against him 7. 17. 9-11; the battle des-
cribed in which Subāhu, Sudharman and
Sudhanvan also participated 7. 17. 12-22;
[Page898-a+ 40]
at the death of Sudhanvan, his followers,
afraid, ran towards the army of Duryo-
dhana 7. 17. 23; Suśarman, king of Tri-
gartas, rebuked those who fled; he remind-
ed them of their terrific oaths ({%śaptvā tu%}
{%śapathān ghorān%}); the troops of Saṃśap-
takas then blew their conches and returned
to fight till death ({%mṛtyuṃ kṛtvā nivarta-%}
{%nam //%}) 7. 17. 27-31; seeing that the troops
of Saṃśaptakas were returning Arjuna asked
Kṛṣṇa to drive his chariot towards them;
he was determined to kill them 7. 18. 1-3;
the Vāyavyāstra released by Arjuna to ward
off the arrows of the opponents also blew
away a large number of Saṃśaptakas along
with their chariots, horses, elephants and
weapons; Arjuna killed a large number of
Saṃśaptakas; their condition as well as the
condition of the battle-field described 7. 18.
22-37; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya how
Arjuna dealt with the army of Saṃśaptakas
({%saṃśaptakabalaṃ prati%}) and how did
they encounter him 7. 25. 2; Arjuna left
Saṃśaptakas for a while to fight with
Bhagadatta who was routing the Pāṇḍava
army; fourteen thousand Saṃśaptakas
followed him and challenged him; Arjuna
hesitated for a while whether to fight with
Saṃśaptakas or go to help Yudhiṣṭhira;
ultimately he decided to kill Saṃśaptakas
(first) ({%abhavad bhuyasī buddhiḥ saṃśa-%}
{%ptakavadhe sthirā%}); the great Saṃśaptaka
chariot-fighters ({%saṃśaptakamahārathāḥ%})
discharged numerous smooth arrows ({%śata-%}
{%sahasrāṇi śarāṇāṃ nataparvaṇāṃ%}) on
Arjuna with the result that, covered with
the arrows, neither Arjuna, nor Kṛṣṇa, nor
his horses, nor chariot, could be seen; when
Kṛṣṇa was deluded ({%moham anuprāptaḥ … %}
{%janārdanaḥ%}) Arjuna killed Saṃśaptakas
[Page898-b+ 40]
with Vajrāstra 7. 26. 10, 12-14, 18-20; the
condition of Saṃśaptakas described 7. 26.
21-27; having killed Saṃśaptakas Arjuna
asked Kṛṣṇa to drive his chariot towards
Bhagadatta 7. 26. 29; but Suśarman and
his Saṃśaptaka brothers followed Arjuna
challenging him for a fight ({%yuddhārthī%}
{%pṛṣthato 'nvayāt // … suśarmāhvayate%}
{%'cyuta //%}); Arjuna therefore was again in
doubt-whether to kill Saṃśaptakas first
or to go to the aid of his side 7. 27. 2-5;
he asked Kṛṣṇa to turn back and started
fighting with Suśarman; his battle with
Saṃśaptaka brothers described in which
Suśarman swooned 7. 27. 7-10; later,
Arjuna continued to kill the surviving Saṃ-
śaptakas and Nārāyaṇas on the southern
side of the army ({%dakṣiṇena tu senāyāḥ%}
{%kurute kadanaṃ bali /saṃśaptakāvaśeṣasya%}
{%nārāyaṇabalasya ca //%}) 7. 30. 29; after
killing the Saṃśaptakas, Arjuna returned to
attack Droṇa and the Kaurava army 7. 31.
41-44; (7) On the thirteenth day, when
Droṇa reiterated the necessity of removing
Arjuna from the main battle, Saṃśapta-
kas renewed their challenge to Arjuna and
took him away to the south of the battle-
field ({%āhvayann arjunaṃ saṃkhye dakṣiṇām%}
{%abhito diśam%}) 7. 32. 15; towards the end
of the day, Arjuna proceeded towards his
camp after killing Saṃśaptakas 7. 50. 1-3;
Yudhiṣṭhira, grieved over the death of
Abhimanyu, told Arjuna that after he left
to fight with the Saṃśaptaka army, Droṇa
made a serious attempt to capture him 7.
51. 1; (8) On the fourteenth day, at
the instance of Duryodhana, the army
of Kauravas, along with Saṃśaptakas,
returned to fight with Sātyaki with great
determination ({%te punaḥ saṃnyavartanta%}
[Page899-a+ 40]
{%kṛtvā saṃśaptakān mithaḥ%}) 7. 97. 12; when
Duḥśāsana was wounded by Sātyaki,
Duryodhana asked Trigartas to fight with
Sātyaki; Saṃśaptakas again made a deter-
mined effort to attack Sātyaki; Sātyaki
killed their five hundred chief warriors,
showering arrows on them, at the head of
the army ({%agrānīke vyapothayat%}) 7. 99.
3-7; their condition described 7. 99. 8-11;
ultimately they retreated in the direction of
Droṇa 7. 99. 12; (9) When Dhṛtarāṣṭra
was told that on the sixteenth day, angry
Arjuna attacked the Saṃśaptaka troops
({%saṃśaptakagaṇān%} 8. 9. 8) he wished to
know the details of the fight between Saṃ-
śaptakas and Arjuna; Arjuna entered the
large ocean-like troops of Saṃśaptakas
({%saṃśaptakagaṇaṃ … arṇavasaṃnibham%})
and agitated it ({%vyakṣobhayat%}); the fight
in which Arjuna cut off the hands and heads
of his opponents with sharp arrows and
killed elephants and horses along with their
riders as well as chariot-fighters was hair-
raising ({%lomaharṣaṇam%}) 8. 12. 1, 3-13; at
that point Aśvatthāman challenged Arjuna;
hence he asked Kṛṣṇa whether he should
continue killing Saṃśaptakas or accept the
challenge of Aśvatthāman: Kṛṣṇa drove
him to Aśvatthāman 8. 12. 21-22; after
fighting with Aśvatthāman, Arjuna return-
ed to Saṃśaptaka horse-riders, chariot-
fighters, elephant-riders and foot-soldiers
({%tataḥ saṃśaptakān bhūyaḥ sāśvasūtaratha-%}
{%dvipān / dhvajapattigaṇān%}) 8. 12. 36; battle
described in which Arjuna killed all kinds
of his opponents ({%saṃśaptakamahārṇavam /%}
{%vyaśoṣayata duḥśoṣam … %}) and returned
to fight with Aśvatthāman 8. 12. 37-43, 47;
after fighting for a while with him, Arjuna
came back to Saṃśaptakas; he cut off the
[Page899-b+ 40]
hands, heads, weapons etc. of the opponents
who did not turn back ({%aparāṅmukhānām%})
8. 12. 54-58; after Arjuna's one more
encounter with Aśvatthāman in which the
latter was removed from the battle by his
horses, Arjuna continued his battle with
Saṃśaptakas 8. 12. 70-71; when there was
loud noise to the north of the battle-field
(8. 13. 1), Kṛṣṇa advised Arjuna to go
there and first fight with Māgadha Daṇḍa-
dhāra; he could later kill the Saṃśaptakas
8. 13. 4; accordingly, Arjuna first killed
Daṇḍadhāra and his elephant and came
back to Saṃśaptakas 8. 13. 25; in the
battle that followed, Arjuna killed many
Saṃśaptakas, while Kṛṣṇa drove his chariot
in various roundabout ways ({%vakrānuva-%}
{%kragamanāt%}) 8. 14. 1; the battle described
8. 14. 2-21; at that moment Kṛṣṇa advised
Arjuna not to while away his time with
Saṃśaptakas; he should kill them without
loss of time and hasten to kill Karṇa
({%kiṃ krīḍase 'nagha / saṃśaptakān prama-%}
{%thyaitāṃs tataḥ karṇavadhe tvara%}); Arjuna
agreed and killed quickly the remaining
Saṃśaptakas ({%kṣipraṃ śiṣṭān saṃśapta-%}
{%kāṃs tadā / ākṣipya śastreṇa balād … %}
{%avadhīt%}) 8. 14. 22-23; Trigartas, along with
Śālvas, Saṃśaptakas, and Nārāyaṇas, led
by the king of Trigartas and his brothers,
attacked Arjuna 8. 19. 2-4; the battle, in
which Saṃśaptakas were killed by hundreds
and thousands ({%śataśo 'tha sahasraśaḥ%} 8.
19. 19) and at one stage they surrounded
Arjuna and showered him with weapons,
described 8. 19. 5-34; in the end almost
the entire Saṃśaptaka army turned back
and did not stay to face Arjuna ({%prāyaśo%}
{%vimukhaṃ sarvaṃ nāvatiṣṭhata saṃyuge%});
Arjuna thus won victory over many Saṃ-
[Page900-a+ 40]
śaptaka troops ({%saṃśaptakagaṇān bahūn%})
8. 19. 34-35; (10) On the seventeenth
day, thirty-four thousand chariot-fighters of
Śaṃśaptakas determined to fight to the end
stood on the left side of the Bārhaspatya-
vyūha of Kauravas ({%catustriṃśatsahasrāṇi%}
{%rathānām anivartinām / saṃśaptakā … %}
{%vāmaṃ pārśvam apālayan … bārhaspatyaḥ%}
{% … mahāvyūhaḥ%}) 8. 31. 14, 26; Śalya
drew attention of Karṇa to Saṃśaptakas
who had challenged Arjuna; in response,
they were being attacked and killed by
Arjuna; angered Saṃśaptakas covered him
on all sides making Arjuna invisible
({%saṃśaptakaiḥ kruddhaiḥ … channaḥ pārtho%}
{%na dṛśyate%}) 8. 31. 56-57; Dhṛtarāṣṭra
asked Saṃjaya to describe to him the
battle between Arjuna and Saṃśaptakas;
Saṃjaya told him that when the armies
were arrayed ({%atha vyūḍheṣv anīkeṣu%}),
Arjuna attacked Saṃśaptakas; wishing
to kill Arjuna and determined to win
victory not minding death ({%vijaye kṛta-%}
{%saṃkalpā mṛtyuṃ kṛtvā nivartanam%}) they
rushed towards Arjuna; their army consi-
sted of many horses, elephants, chariot-
fighters and foot-soldiers; a fierce battle
then took place; Arjuna cut off their hands,
holding different weapons, as well as their
heads; thinking Arjuna's chariot was
drowned in the large army, Saṃśaptakas
delightfully raised a roar ({%tasmin sainye%}
{%mahāvarte … /nimagnaṃ taṃ rathaṃ matvā%}
{%neduḥ saṃśaptakā mudā / %}) 8. 32. 1-13; at
the site where Arjuna was killing Saṃśapta-
kas a loud sound of Gāṇḍīva was heard;
very much angered Saṃśaptakas, coveting
victory ({%jayagṛddhāḥ pramanyavaḥ%}) sho-
wered arrows on Arjuna; Arjuna braved
their attack and reached Suśarman; when
[Page900-b+ 40]
Arjuna started showering arrows on Suśar-
man, Saṃśaptakas responded the same way;
hearing the roar of the monkey on Arjuna's
chariot, the army of Saṃśaptakas was much
terrified and became motionless; regain-
ing consciousness, the warriors showered
arrows on Arjuna and covered his chariot;
they held firmly the horses, the wheels and
the shaft of Arjuna's chariot and roared
loudly ({%te hayān rathacakre ca ratheṣāś%}
{%cāpi bhārata / nigṛhya balavat%}); some
mounted on Arjuna's chariot and held him
and Kṛṣṇa; shaking his hands Kṛṣṇa felled
them down; Arjuna saw Saṃśaptaka great
chariot-fighters encircling him and holding
his chariot and Kṛṣṇa; he felled many of
them down who had mounted the chariot
and other foot-soldiers who were close to
him by shooting arrows which went short
distances ({%apātayat / āsannāṃś ca tato%}
{%yodhāñ śarair āsannayodhibhiḥ%}); he made
the rest run away; Arjuna pointed out to
Kṛṣṇa that he had killed thousands of
Saṃśaptakas who had achieved the difficult
task of checking his chariot ({%kurvāṇān%}
{%dāruṇaṃ karma … rathabandhaṃ imaṃ /%}
{%ghoraṃ%}); Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa blew Deva-
datta and Pāñcajanya conches respy.;
hearing that sound, the Saṃśaptaka army
shook and became very much afraid ({%saṃ-%}
{%cacāla … vitrastā cābhavad bhṛśam%});
Arjuna then bound their feet by releasing
{%nāgāstra;%} he killed them in that condition;
when they were being killed, they gave up
fighting with Arjuna and threw down their
weapons; then Suśarman released them
from their bonds by using {%sauparṇāstra;%}
once free, they showered arrows and
weapons on Arjuna ({%sasṛjur bāṇasaṃ-%}
{%ghāṃś ca śastrasaṃghāṃś ca%}); Arjuna cut
[Page901-a+ 40]
off the missiles with arrows and killed many
elephants, horses and chariot-fighters by
using {%aindrāstra;%} the troops of Saṃśaptakas
and Nārāyaṇas were then very much afraid;
no one was able to fight back Arjuna ({%na%}
{%hi kaścit pumāṃs tatra yo 'rjunaṃ pratya-%}

the opposing warriors; fourteen thousand
(foot) warriors, an {%ayuta%} of chariot-
fighters, and three thousand elephant-
riders of Saṃśaptakas who survived ({%yāni%}
{%śiṣṭāni%}) once again surrounded Arjuna
determined either to return with victory
or die ({%martavayam iti niścitya jayaṃ vāpi%}
{%nivartanam%}); a fierce fighting then was
fought between them and Arjuna (8. 37.
1-38); Arjuna destroyed many Saṃśapta-
kas; their Kṣatriyas, tormented by him,
were killed ({%te kṣatriyā dahyamānās … %}
{%jagmur vināśam%}) 8. 40. 5-61 after killing
many Saṃśaptaka troops ({%nihatya … saṃ-%}

away as they were unable to resist his
arrows ({%dhāvanti sagaṇāḥ saṃśaptakamahā-%}

80; Duryodhana again incited Saṃśaptakas
to face Arjuna; then a thousand chariot-
fighters, three hundred elephant-riders,
fourteen thousand horse-riders and two
hundred thousand archers turned towards
Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna covering them with
arrows; but Arjuna killed ten thousand
Saṃśaptakas 8. 40. 92-99; thus Arjuna
completely destroyed ({%kṛtsnena vyadha-%}

Arjuna, after defeating Aśvatthāman (8.
42. 51), asked Kṛṣṇa to take him to Saṃ-
śaptakas since fighting with them was his
main task ({%kāryam etat paraṃ mama%}) 8.
42. 3, 56; Arjuna killed the remaining Saṃ-
śaptaka troops with sharp arrows with the
result that they became the guests of Indra
and became free from grief as they were
happy ({%śakrasyātithitām gatvā viśokā hy%}
{%abhavan mudā%}) 8. 43. 76-77; when Arjuna
told Bhīma that he could not leave the
battlefield (to go to enquire about Yudhi-
ṣṭhira) without killing Saṃśaptakas who
faced him, Bhīma assured him that he
himself would fight with the Saṃśaptakas
8. 45. 63-64; Arjuna while explaining to
Yudhiṣṭhira why he had not yet killed
Karṇa told him that during his fight with
Saṃśaptakas, Aśvatthāman had unexpec-
tedly intervened (to distract him) 8. 47.
2; later, while boasting about his heroic
deeds Arjuna mentioned that he had killed
almost all Saṃśaptakas and only a few of
them had survived ({%saṃśaptakānāṃ kiṃcid%}

sana along with the fully equipped army of
Saṃśaptakas ({%pṛtanā samṛddhā%}) attacked
Bhīma 8. 53. 9; when Arjuna was proceeding
towards Karṇa, Saṃśaptaka chariot-fighters
attacked him showering arrows; Arjuna
killed many of them along with their chari-
oteers, and cut off their bows and banners
with sharp arrows; they all fell down from
their chariots 8. 59. 3-5; (11) On the
seventeenth day, at night, when Saṃjaya
reported to Dhṛtarāṣṭra the death of Karṇa
(8. 1. 25), he (Dhṛtarāṣṭra), while recalling
some of the major events of war, mention-
ed the killing of the Saṃśaptaka army by
Arjuna 8. 1. 41; in reply to Dhṛtarāṣṭra's

troops ({%saṃśaptakagaṇāś ca ye%}) among
those who were killed by Arjuna 8. 4.

speedily rushed towards Kṛtavarman and
Saṃśaptaka troops which were posted on
the left side of the Sarvatobhadravyūha of
Kauravas 9. 7. 30, 19, 24 (where Saṃ-
śaptakas are designated as Trigartas);
Arjuna, having killed Saṃśaptakas in battle
({%hatvā saṃśaptakān raṇe%}) rushed towards,

day advanced ({%madhyaṃdinagate sūrye%}),
Aśvatthāman, helped by Saṃśaptakas

the battle was terrific in which a large

having returned early in the morning from
the camp ({%tataḥ pūrvāhṇasamaye śibirād%}

loss of life in war mentioned that many
Saṃśaptakas were killed ({%saṃśaptakāś ca%}

{@Sṛñjaya@}¦ m. (pl.): Name of a people,
very likely a section of the Pāñcālas; some-
times they are almost identified with them,
but sometimes mentioned along with them
and / or with Somakas.
{@A.@} Description of their warriors:
Magnanimous ({%mahātman%}) 6. 85. 21; very
vigorous ({%mahaujas%}) 7. 132. 41; heroic
({%vīra%}) 6. 68. 15; of great strength ({%mahā-%}
{%bala%}) 6. 86. 76; 6. 103. 11; difficult to be
attacked ({%durādharṣa%}) 6. 103. 10; great

great chariot-fighters ({%mahāratha%}) 8. 40. 2;
tigers among men ({%puruṣavyāghra%}) 7. 101.
51. {@B.@} Epic events: (1) Bhīma told
Yudhiṣṭhira that it was not impossible to
get back the kingdom by waging war
with Kauravas since Pāṇḍavas could count
on the help of Sṛñjayas, Kaikeyas and
Kṛṣṇa (in such contexts they are identified
with Pāñcālas) 3. 34. 85; he also told him
that all his relatives as well as Sṛñjayas
wish well of him and keep quiet (only he
and Draupadī got excited) ({%sarve te priyam%}
{%icchanti bāndhavāḥ saha sṛñjayaiḥ / aham%}
{%eko 'bhisaṃtapto mātā ca prativindhyataḥ //%})
3. 36. 15; (2) Dhṛtarāṣṭra felt that it
[Page916-a+ 40]
was better to give back to Pāṇḍavas their
share of kingdom before war broke out
in which Yudhiṣṭhira would be backed by
Kṛṣṇa, Sātyaki and Sṛñjayas 5. 22. 9; 5.
56. 33; when he sent Saṃjaya to Upa-
plavya, he asked him (Saṃjaya) to enquire
about the health of all including Sṛñjayas
({%teṣāṃ bhāgaṃ … purā yuddhāt sādhu tasya%}
{%pradānam // … anāmayaṃ madvacanena pṛ-%}
{%ccheḥ%}) 5. 22. 8-9, 38; (3) Sañjaya wanted
Yudhiṣṭhira to work for peace so that
Kauravas, Pāṇḍavas, Sṛñjayas and the rest
of the assembled kings would live in happi-
ness ({%śamaṃ kuryā yena śarmāpnuyus te%})
5. 24. 9; Yudhiṣṭhira asked Saṃjaya to
communicate the message of Dhṛtarāṣṭra
to the assembly in which Sṛñjayas were
also present 5. 25. 1; Saṃjaya appealed to
all of them to act in a way that would
lead to the well-being of Kurus and Sṛñja-
yas ({%kṛtāñjaliḥ śaraṇaṃ vaḥ prapadye%}
{%kathaṃ svasti syāt kurusṛñjayānām%}) 5.
25. 14; Yudhiṣṭhira failed to see how there
could be well-being for Kurus and Sṛñjayas
when Dhṛtarāṣṭra had usurped the pro-
sperity of Pāṇḍavas ({%kathaṃ svasti syāt%}
{%kurusṛñjayānām / āttaiśvaryo dhṛtarāṣṭraḥ%}
{%parebhyaḥ /%}) 5. 26. 18; Yudhiṣṭhira also
told Saṃjaya that Sṛñjayas followed the
advice of Kṛṣṇa and hence were cap-
able of controlling their enemies and de-
lighting their friends ({%sṛñjayāś … /upāsīnā%}
{%vāsudevasya buddhiṃ … %}) 5. 28. 11; (4)
Saṃjaya told Duryodhana that Pāṇḍavas
and Sṛñjayas heard attentively all that
Arjuna wanted him to convey to the
Kurus; Arjuna said that Duryodhana
would repent when he saw Dhṛṣṭa-
dyumna fighting at the head of the army
of Sṛñjayas; he also told Saṃjaya that
[Page916-b+ 40]
their Brāhmaṇas who were experts in
astrology had predicted the destruction of
Kurus and Sṛñjayas in war 5. 47. 5, 37,
93; (5) Dhṛtarāṣṭra envied those who
could see and listen to the words of Kṛṣṇa
which were meant for the welfare of
Sṛñjayas ({%bhāratīm … śaṅkarīṃ sṛñjayā-%}
{%nām%}) 5. 69. 2 (Nī. on Bom. Ed. 5. 71. 2:
{%śaṃkarīṃ kalyāṇakarīm%}); (6) Kṛṣṇa
assured Yudhiṣṭhira that when he met the
Kauravas he would try to keep the agitated
Kurus and Sṛñjayas away from the noose
of death ({%mocayeyaṃ mṛtyupāśāt saṃrab-%}
{%dhān kurusṛñjayān%}) 5. 70. 81; (7) Before
Kṛṣṇa left to meet the Kauravas, Drau-
padī told him that the Pāṇḍavas, along
with Sṛñjayas would be able to face the
army of Kauravas ({%śakṣyanti hi mahābāho%}
{%pāṇḍavāḥ sṛñjayaiḥ saha / dhārtarāṣṭra-%}
{%balaṃ … pratisamāsitum%}) 5. 80. 11 (Nī.
on Bom. Ed. 5. 82. 11: {%pratisamāsituṃ%}
{%pratipakṣatayā sthātum%}); according to her,
severe punishment should be quickly in-
flicted on Kauravas by Pāṇḍavas, Sṛñjayas
and Kṛṣṇa; he should take care to see
that he, along with Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas,
was not blamed for not killing one who
deserved to be killed 5. 80. 14, 18-19;
(8) Kṛṣṇa assured Vidura that he would
attempt to bring about reconciliation
between Kurus and Sṛñjayas who would
otherwise perish in war ({%saṃgrāme vina-%}
{%śiṣyatām%}) 5. 91. 8; (9) Duryodhana
wanted to know from Kṛṣṇa what wrong
did the Kauravas do to Pāṇḍavas and
Sṛñjayas or for what fault of Kauravas
did they want to kill Kauravas ({%kim asmā-%}
{%bhiḥ kṛtaṃ teṣāṃ kasmin vā punar āgasi%}) 5.
125. 11; (10) When Ulūka was asked by
Yudhiṣṭhira to convey to the assembly the
[Page917-a+ 40]
view of Duryodhana, he spoke to them
who included, among others, all Sṛñjayas
5. 158. 4-5; (11) Bhīṣma assured Duryo-
dhana that in case of war Droṇa would
kill Sṛñjayas ({%gacched antaṃ sṛñjayānām%})
5. 164. 15; (12) Before the start of the
war, Duryodhana told Duḥśāsana to pro-
tect Bhīṣma so that he might kill Pāṇḍavas
and Sṛñjayas 6. 16. 14; seeing Bhīṣma at the
head of the Kaurava army, Pāṇḍavas and
Sṛñjayas, led by Dhṛṣṭadyumna, shivered
({%samakampanta pāṇḍavāḥ / sṛñjayāś ca%}
{% … dhṛṣṭadyumnapurogamāḥ //%}) 6. 16. 42;
(13) On the third day of the war, due to
the quickness of Bhīṣma's action, Pāṇḍavas
and Sṛñjayas felt that there were many
hundreds and thousands of him ({%aneka-%}
{%śatasāhasram samapaśyanta lāghavāt%}) 6.
55. 22 (also cf. st. 21); (14) On the
fourth day, at one stage, Kurus and Sṛñja-
yas watched the duel between Bhīṣma and
Arjuna 6. 56. 28; (15) On the fifth day,
towards midday ({%madhyandinagate sūrye%} 6.
68. 12), Sṛñjayas fought a very fierce battle
with Kurus in which arrows, {%śaktis, tomaras%}
were used 6. 68. 15-16; the battle describ-
ed 18-19; the same day, later, Sṛñjayas,
when they lost their armours, and their
chariots were broken and bows were cut
off, and their hair dishevelled, they wrestled
with Kurus ({%bāhubhiḥ samayudhyanta%}) 6.
69. 39; when the sun was about to set
({%sūrye 'stam upagacchati%} 6. 70. 34), and
when the stopping of the war was declared,
Pāṇḍavas, along with Sṛñjayas, went to
their camps 6. 70. 37; (16) On the sixth
day, when Bhīṣma and Droṇa started killing
the Pāṇḍava army, Sṛñjayas and Kekayas
fied ({%palāyanaparābhavan%}) 6. 71. 32; (17)
On the seventh day, when Bhīṣma attack-
[Page917-b+ 40]
ed Yudhiṣṭhira, Sṛñjayas riding chariots,
elephants and horses trembled for they
feared Yudhiṣṭhira would soon be killed
({%sarathanāgāśvāḥ samakampanta sṛñjayāḥ%})
6. 82. 2-3; later in the afternoon ({%aparāṃ%}
{%diśam āsthāya sthite savitari%} 6. 82. 28)
Bhīṣma neglected the challenge of Śikha-
ṇḍin and attacked Sṛñjayas; they were
happy to face Bhīṣma ({%sṛñjayās tu tato%}
{%hṛṣṭā … %}) and raised loud roars and blew
their conches; a fierce battle followed in
which chariot-fighters and elephant-riders
mingled with one another 6. 82. 26-28;
(18) On the eighth day, Bhīṣma started
killing Sṛñjayas, Pāñcālas and others; they
attacked Bhīṣma not fearing death (Sṛñja-
yas not directly mentioned, only Pāñcālas
are mentioned); Bhīṣma cut off arms and
heads of those riding horses and elephants
and deprived the chariot-fighters of their
chariots; he also killed elephants 6. 84.
3-7; when Droṇa killed Somakas and
Sṛñjayas a loud cry went up from their
army; the Kṣatriyas rolled on the ground
like those afflicted by ailments; their cry
was like one of those who become lean
due to hunger ({%viveṣṭantaḥ sma dṛśyante%}
{%vyādhikliṣṭā narā iva // … aniśaṃ śrūyate%}
{%śabdaḥ kṣutkṛśānāṃ nṛṇām iva //%}) 6. 85.
20-23; after the death of Irāvant, there
was fierce fighting in which the Kaurava
army and Sṛñjayas, not caring for their
lives in battle, killed one another; with
their hair loose and without their armours,
when they were deprived of their chariots
and their bows were cut off they wrestl-
ed with one another ({%juhvataḥ samare%}
{%prāṇān nijaghnur itaretaram // muktakeśā%}
{%vikavacā virathāś chinnakārmukāḥ / bāhu-%}
{%bhiḥ samayudhyanta samavetāḥ paraspa-%}
[Page918-a+ 40]
{%ram //%}) 6. 86. 76-77; when Bhagadatta
proceeded to attack Yudhiṣṭhira, he fought
a severe battle with Pāñcālas, Sṛñjayas and
Kekayas who were ready to fight with their
weapons ({%udyatāyudhaiḥ%}) 6. 91. 79-80;
Bhīṣma told Duryodhana that since he had
dug up enmity with Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas
he should fight with them manfully; he him-
self also would kill Somakas and Pāñcālas
(which term includes Sṛñjayas) ({%yudhyasva%}
{%tān adya raṇe … puruṣo bhava%}) 6. 94. 13-
15; (19) At the end of the ninth day,
it appeared that Bhīṣma had defeated
Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas; so at the start of
the night ({%rātrimukhe%}) Pāṇḍavas, Vṛṣṇis
and Sṛñjayas held consultation ({%mantrāya%}
{%samupāviśan%}) 6. 103. 8, 10-11; (20) At
the start of the tenth day, Kaurava army
was being destroyed by the sharp arrows
of Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas; hence, Bhīṣma,
not caring for life, attacked them 6. 104.
23, 26, 29; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya
how on the tenth day Bhīṣma, when attack-
ed by Śikhaṇḍin determined to kill him
(6. 104. 45-46), fought with Pāṇḍavas and
Sṛñjayas ({%daśame 'hani%}) 6. 105. 3; when
Bhīṣma began to destroy the Pāṇḍava army,
the great chariot-fighters ({%mahārathāḥ%})
of Sṛñjayas attacked Bhīṣma to kill him
({%vadhāyābhyadravan bhīṣmam%}) 6. 105. 35;
as the war advanced Pāṇḍavas, backed
by Sṛñjayas ({%saṃhatāḥ saha sṛñjayaiḥ%}),
attacked Bhīṣma 6. 110. 40; Dhṛtarāṣṭra
once again asked Saṃjaya how Bhīṣma
fought with Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas on
the tenth day 6. 111. 1; as advised
by Bhīṣma, Arjuna led Sṛñjayas (and
Pāñcālas) to attack Bhīṣma and kill him;
Sṛñjayas were asked to attack Bhīṣma
without fear as they would be protected by
[Page918-b+ 40]
Bhīma and Arjuna 6. 111. 15-20; exhorted
by Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Somakas and Sṛñjayas
attacked Bhīṣma showering weapons on
him ({%śastravṛṣṭyā%}); angered Bhīṣma fought
with them 6. 113. 16-18; the weapons used
by Sṛñjayas are detailed in 6. 114. 2-3;
Sṛñjayas and Pāṇḍavas raised a loud roar
when Bhīṣma fell down 6. 114. 101; at the
end of the tenth day when Dhṛtarāṣṭra was
informed about Bhīṣma's downfall he
wondered who could be the warriors who
surrounded Bhīṣma ({%ke vīrāḥ paryavārayan%})
while he was showering arrows on Pāñcālas
and Sṛñjayas; he also wished to know who
from among the Kauravas were on the
left side of the wheel of Bhīṣma and shot
arrows on Sṛñjayas ({%vāme cakre vartamānāḥ%}
{%ke 'ghnan saṃjaya sṛñjayān%}) 6. 15. 25,
28, 32; (21) On hearing the death of
Bhīṣma (7. 2. 1), Karṇa admitted that the
army which included Pāṇḍavas, Sātyaki,
Kṛṣṇa and Sṛñjayas was invincible by kings;
7. 2. 31; (22) On the eleventh day,
Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas met with arrows
Droṇa's attack on them; Droṇa broke and
scattered their army; agitated by the arrows
of Droṇa, they were again and again sca-
ttered by him ({%te kampyamānā droṇena%}
{%bāṇaiḥ pāṇḍavasṛñjayāḥ / punaḥ punar abha-%}
{%jyanta%}) 7. 6. 33, 35, 41; Sṛñjayas, though
they tried, were not able to kill the army
of Droṇa as it was protected by him; since
Droṇa was acting very swiftly, Pāṇḍavas and
Sṛñjayas felt as if there were many Droṇas
({%ekam āśukāriṇam āhave / anekam iva%}
{%saṃtrāsān menire%}) 7. 12. 19, 23; Sṛñjayas
trembled seeing Droṇa, like fire, burning
the army of Pāṇḍavas ({%sākṣād agnim ivo-%}
{%tthitam%}) 7. 13. 2; Sṛñjayas and others with
their weapons raised ({%udyatāyudhāḥ%}) met
[Page919-a+ 40]
the attack of Aśvasena and others; a fierce
battle ensued 7. 15. 11-12; at the sunset
when the withdrawal of the Pāṇḍava army
was declared by Arjuna ({%svāny anīkāni … %}
{%avahārayat%}), Sṛñjayas greeted him for his
deeds during the day 7. 15. 49-50; (23) On
the twelfth day, after killing Śatānīka, Droṇa
repeatedly defeated Sṛñjayas and others;
seeing Droṇa, like fire, burning the army of
Pāṇḍavas, Sṛñjayas trembled; due to the
heroism of Droṇa, a river carrying the
bodies of Kurus and Pāñcālas to the god
of death began to flow ({%nadīm antaka-%}
{%gāminīm%}) 7. 20. 23-24, 34, 36; when Droṇa
killed a Pāñcāla prince, Sṛñjayas and others
attacked Droṇa shouting ‘kill Droṇa, kill
Droṇa’ ({%hata droṇaṃ hata droṇam ity%}
{%āsīt tumulaṃ mahat /%}); but Droṇa agitated
them who were very angry 7. 20. 48-49;
when Sṛñjayas and others were agitated and
were pushed back ({%calitān … praṇunnān%})
by the arrows of Droṇa, Kauravas raised a
loud roar 7. 21. 7-8; Duryodhana drew
attention of Karṇa towards Bhīma who was
deserted by Pāṇḍava warriors and Sṛñjayas
({%hīnaḥ pāṇḍavasṛñjayaiḥ%}) 7. 21. 16; (24)
On the thirteenth day, Pāñcāla army which
included thousands of Sṛñjayas attacked
Droṇa; but Droṇa arrested their advance
with arrows; then Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas did
not attack him 7. 34. 5-7, 10; when Abhi-
manyu defeated Duḥśāsana, Sṛñjayas and
others were delighted 7. 39. 11, 17-18;
when Subhadrā heard the death of Abhi-
manyu, she pitied Sṛñjayas and the rest
who did not seem to know when Abhi-
manyu was felled down ({%dhik kekayāṃs … %}
{%sṛñjayān / ye tvā raṇe gataṃ vīraṃ na%}
{%jānanti nipātitam%}) 7. 55. 13; (25) On the
fourteenth day, Sātyaki shot arrows at
[Page919-b+ 40]
Droṇa who was as though swallowing
({%grasantam iva%}) Sṛñjayas 7. 72. 34; the
demon Alambusa made a river flow on the
battle-field carrying the dead bodies of
Sṛñjayas and others ({%nadīṃ pravartayām%}
{%āsa%}) 7. 83. 30; when the Pāṇḍava army,
which included Sṛñjayas, attacked Droṇa
there was a loud roar among the Sṛñjayas
({%tatrārāvo mahān āsīt%}); when Droṇa
started killing them, Sṛñjayas found no
protector 7. 85. 20, 26; Yudhiṣṭhira assured
Sātyaki that when he (Sātyaki) would leave
to assist Arjuna, Sṛñjayas and others would
be there to protect him (Yudhiṣṭhira) 7.
86. 45; Sṛñjayas and others, thrilled, rushed
at Droṇa to fight with him with all their
might ({%sarvaśaktyā%}); but Droṇa killed
them 7. 101. 50-52; Droṇa asked Duryo-
dhana to go to help Jayadratha; he himself
would obstruct the onward march of
Sṛñjayas and others 7. 105. 21; (26) After
the death of Jayadratha, before the start
of the night war between the fourteenth
and fifteenth day, Droṇa pointed out to
Duryodhana the armies of Pāṇḍavas and
Sṛñjayas marching towards him (Droṇa)
7. 126. 31; he directed Duryodhana to hold
back his army if he could, for Kurus and
Sṛñjayas would continue to fight even dur-
ing the night; with these words, Droṇa mar-
ched against Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas ({%tvaṃ%}
{%ca duryodhana balaṃ yadi śaknoṣi dhāraya%})
7. 126. 38-39; then, there was fierce fighting
in the evening ({%saṃdhyāyām%}) all around
between Droṇa and Sṛñjayas 7. 129. 18;
when the fierce fighting progressed during
the night, Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas together
attacked Droṇa ({%rātriyuddhe tathā ghore%}
{%vartamāne sudāruṇe%}); Droṇa forced all
of them back killing some of them ({%tān%}
[Page920-a+ 40]
{%sarvān vimukhāṃś cakre kāṃścin ninye%}
{%yamakṣayam%}) 7. 129. 34-35; Dhṛtarāṣṭra
asked Saṃjaya how did Kauravas feel
when Droṇa entered the (army of) Sṛñjayas
({%kā vo 'bhūd vai matis tadā%}) 7. 130. 1;
Sṛñjayas and Pāñcālas followed Bhīma and
Arjuna who showered arrows on Droṇa
trying to scatter the army of Drupada with
Vāyavyāstra 7. 132. 37, 41; 7. 136. 14;
Aśvatthāman challenged his opponents to
attack him and then killed Pāñcālas and
Sṛñjayas; they abandoned Aśvatthāman and
fled in all directions ({%vyadravanta diśo daśa%}
7. 135. 19) when their chariots and banners
were scattered ({%viprakīrṇarathadhvajāḥ%}) 7.
135. 51; Duryodhana asked Duḥśāsana and
his other brothers to offer protection to
Droṇa who would then kill Sṛñjayas and
their kings ({%sṛñjayāṃś ca sarājakān%}); when
all Sṛñjayas were killed, Aśvatthāman would
kill Dhṛṣṭadyumna 7. 139. 24-25; in the
fighting that followed Aśvatthāman cover-
ed Drupada and Droṇa covered Sṛñjayas
with smooth arrows ({%chādayām āsatuḥ%}
{%saṃkhye śaraiḥ saṃnataparvabhiḥ%}) 7. 139.
31; when Aśvatthāman swooned while fight-
ing with Ghaṭotkaca, Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas
raised a loud roar ({%siṃhanādaṃ praca-%}
{%krire%}) 7. 141. 32; considering that Bhīma
had killed Duryodhana, Pāñcālas, Sṛñjayas
and others made all effort to attack Droṇa
to fight with him ({%sarvodyogenābhijagmur%}
{% … %}); a fierce battle then was fought 7.
141. 60; when Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas were
being killed by Karṇa, they apprehended
his presence nearby even when a blade of
grass stirred ({%tṛṇapraspandanāc cāpi sūta-%}
{%putraṃ sma menire%}) 7. 148. 15 (Nī. on
Bom. Ed. 7. 173. 19: {%atibhayāt tṛṇacalana-%}
{%mātreṇāpi karṇaṃ prāptaṃ menire%}); they
[Page920-b+ 40]
mistook a running warrior on their own
side to be Karṇa ({%api svaṃ samare yodhaṃ%}
{%dhāvamānaṃ vicetasaḥ / karṇam evābhya-%}
{%manyanta … %}); hence, afraid, they ran
but Karṇa attacked them from behind
({%pṛṣṭhato vikirañ śarān%}) 7. 148. 15-17;
when Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas were excessi-
vely tormented by the Rākṣasas of Alā-
yudha they had no peace of mind ({%na%}
{%śāntiṃ lebhire tatra%}) 7. 152. 31; Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra wondered why Karṇa, instead of
killing Ghaṭotkaca, did not kill Arjuna
with the {%śakti%} given to him by Indra; for,
the death of Arjuna would have meant the
death of all Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas long
ago 7. 157. 2; the same opinion was held
by Kṛṣṇa (and hence he deluded the mind
of Karṇa whenever he faced Arjuna) 7.
157. 35; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya how
did Sṛñjayas and Pāñcālas with their armies
arrayed and in striking position ({%vyūḍhānī-%}
{%kāḥ prahāriṇaḥ%}) fight with Kurus and how
did they attack Droṇa who, not caring for
his life, had plunged into their army after
the death of Ghaṭotkaca ({%jīvitaṃ tyaktvā%}
{%gāhamānaṃ varūthinīm%}) 7. 158. 13-15;
Droṇa killed three grand-sons of Drupada
and then defeated Cedis, Kekayas, Sṛñjayas
and Matsyas 7. 161. 31-32; (27) On
the fifteenth day, Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas,
although they were being killed by Droṇa,
attacked him and confused him ({%mohayanto%}
{%mahāratham%}) 7. 164. 60; after killing Vasu-
dāna (king of Pāṃśurāṣṭra), Droṇa killed
six thousand Sṛñjayas 7. 164. 85; exhorted
by Yudhiṣṭhira to assist Dhṛṣṭadyumna, the
great chariot-fighters of Sṛñjayas attacked
Droṇa in order to kill him; Droṇa with
great speed moved against them not mind-
ing his death ({%martavyam iti niścitaḥ%});
[Page921-a+ 40]
bad omens occurred; Droṇa, encircled by
the armies of Drupada, moved burning
host of Kṣatriyas and killed a very large
number of them 7. 165. 8-16; when ulti-
mately Droṇa was killed by Dhṛṣṭadyumna,
Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas attacked the dis-
heartened Kurus with the result that their
army was shattered ({%nirutsāhān kurūn%}
{% … abhyadravan … tataḥ sainyaṃ vyadīr-%}
{%yata%}) 7. 165. 58; when Aśvatthāman
used his {%nārāyaṇāstra,%} Pāṇḍavas, Pāñcālas
and Sṛñjayas were dismayed to see the
mid-region filled with different weapons
({%śastrākṛtibhir ākīrṇam atīva … dṛṣṭvā-%}
{%ntarikṣam āvignāḥ pāṇḍupāñcālasṛñjayāḥ%})
7. 170. 20; at the end of the day, when
Saṃjaya reported to Dhṛtarāṣṭra the
death of Droṇa, he asked Saṃjaya what
was Droṇa doing on the battle-field
when Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas managed
to kill him ({%kiṃ kurvāṇaṃ raṇe droṇam%}
{%jaghnuḥ pāṇḍavasṛñjayāḥ%}) 7. 8. 1; Saṃjaya
assured Dhṛtarāṣṭra that since he was an
eye-witness to the whole event ({%sarvaṃ%}
{%pratyakṣadarśivān%}) he would narrate to him
how Droṇa fell when overpowered ({%sāditaḥ%})
by Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas 7. 11. 1; (28)
On the sixteenth day, Duryodhana was
confident that with Karṇa as their general
Pāṇḍavas, Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas would
loose their consciousness ({%gatacetasaḥ%}) 8.
6. 31; Kṛṣṇa pointed out to Arjuna that
Karṇa, as intended by Aśvatthāman ({%aśva-%}
{%tthāmanaś ca saṃkalpād … %}) had killed
Sṛñjayas 8. 16. 5; Karṇa brought Sṛñjayas
and Pāñcālas within the range of his arrows
and crushed them ({%śaragocaram ānayat /%}
{%mamarda%}); Kurus, Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas
fought with great effort not caring for
their life ({%vyāyacchamānāḥ subhṛśam … %}

{%priyān asūn raṇe tyaktvā%}) 8. 16. 22, 24-
25; battle described 8. 16. 26-38; at mid-
day ({%madhyaṃ gate dinakare%} 8. 17. 100),
although Karṇa killed Sṛñjayas they attack-
ed him 8. 17. 117; (29) On the seven-
teenth day, early morning ({%prabhātāyāṃ%}
{%rajanyāṃ tu%} 8. 22. 29) before the start of
the war, Duryodhana while requesting Śalya
to act as a charioteer of Karṇa told him
that with a good charioteer like him, Karṇa
would be able to destroy Pāṇḍavas, Pāñcā-
las and Sṛñjayas 8. 23. 15; at the start of
the war on that day, Pāñcālas, Cedis and
Sṛñjayas fought a fierce battle with the
Kaurava army 8. 32. 15; Dhṛtarāṣṭra
remembered that Karṇa had boasted earlier
that he alone would kill Sṛñjayas along
with Pāṇḍavas 8. 35. 2; Sṛñjayas cut off
({%śātayām āsuḥ%}) the arrows shot at them
by Kṛpa 8. 38. 4; Karṇa stopped the on-
ward march of Sṛñjayas and others who
were led by Bhīma 8. 38. 16; Karṇa killed
Cedis, Karūṣas and Sṛñjayas in the presence
of Bhīma; when Bhīma left Karṇa to fight
with the Kuru army, Karṇa killed thou-
sands of great archers of Sṛñjayas ({%sṛñ-%}
{%jayāṃś ca maheśvāsān nijaghāna sahasra-%}

the fire in the form of Karṇa ({%karṇāgninā%}
{% … dagdhā … %}) 8. 40. 61; Arjuna pointed out
to Kṛṣṇa that the large army of Sṛñjayas
was being scattered ({%dīryate%}) by Karṇa
8. 40. 81; when Bhīma returned to fight
({%saṃnivṛtto raṇaṃ prati%}), Pāñcālas and
Sṛñjayas, led by Dhṛṣṭadyumna, followed
him 8. 41. 3; Kurus led by Karṇa and
Sṛñjayas led by Yudhiṣṭhira faced one
another without fear ({%abhītāḥ%}) 8. 42. 1;
Kṛṣṇa pointed out to Arjuna that Karṇa,
after defeating Pāṇḍavas, Pāñcālas and
[Page922-a+ 40]
Sṛñjayas was looking for Arjuna: when
the Kuru warriors saw Karṇa displaying
his valour by harassing Pāṇḍavas and
thousands of Sṛñjayas they raised a loud
roar ({%nadanti%}); Karṇa encouraged Kau-
rava warriors to attack Sṛñjayas so that
none of them escaped alive ({%yathā jivan%}
{%na vaḥ kaścin mucyate%}) 8. 43. 36; Kṛṣṇa
was glad to point out to Arjuna that Bhīma,
along with Sātyaki and Sṛñjayas, had once
again returned to the battle-field 8. 43. 52;
Yudhiṣṭhira wondered whether the en-
counter of Sṛñjayas and Kauravas in which
he was humiliated had become known to
the fighters ({%kaccit saṃgrāme vidito vā%}
{%tadāyaṃ samāgamaḥ sṛñjayakauravā-%}
{%ṇām / yatrāvasthām īdṛśīṃ prāpito 'ham%})
8. 46. 41; Kṛṣṇa told Arjuna that all
Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas with their followers
were prepared to fight when they had
resorted to him ({%ete ca sarve pāñcālāḥ%}
{%sṛñjayāś ca sahānvayāḥ / tvāṃ samāsādya%}
{% … vyavasthitāḥ%}) 8. 51. 5; while taking
stock of some of the events of the battle
which had lasted for seventeen days ({%adya%}
{%saptadaśāhāni%} 8. 51. 2), Kṛṣṇa reminded
Arjuna that while Bhīṣma was fighting,
Sṛñjayas were unable to look at him;
Bhīṣma routed Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas
and distinguished himself as the sole
war hero ({%ekavīratvam āgataḥ%}) 8. 51. 35;
Kṛṣṇa pointed out to Arjuna that Bhīma,
covered on all sides by Sṛñjayas, was
being tormented while fighting with Karṇa:
if Karṇa was neglected he might kill
Pāṇḍavas, Sṛñjayas and Pāñcālas 8. 51.
105-106; at one stage in the battle, Utta-
maujas had engaged Sṛñjayas 8. 53. 6;
Arjuna asked Kṛṣṇa to drive his chariot
towards Karṇa, lest he destroyed all Sṛñ-

presence ({%rādheyo 'py anyathā pārthān%}

fought with one another using straight-
flying and very sharp arrows ({%śarais%}
{%tadāñjogatibhiḥ sutejanaiḥ%}) 8. 57. 67; once
again a very severe fighting broke out
between Kurus and Sṛñjayas in which they
used besides arrows weapons like swords,
{%śaktis,%} lances, maces and {%paraśvadhas%} 8.
62. 40; when Karṇa was killed, Arjuna was
honoured by Sṛñjayas, Pāñcālas and others
8. 69. 37; on the seventeenth night ({%niśi%} 8.
1. 25) while reporting Karṇa's death to
Dhṛtarāṣṭra Saṃjaya told him that Karṇa,
before his death, had killed Kekayas and
Videhas in the presence of all Sṛñjayas
and Pāñcālas ({%sa sṛñjayānāṃ sarveṣāṃ%}
{%pāñcālānāṃ ca paśyatām / kekayānāṃ%}

18; Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya who among
the Kurus and Sṛñjayas were dead and who
were alive 8. 4. 3; (30) On the eighteenth
day, when Śalya became the general the
Madras encouraged him saying that he
was capable of defeating in battle even
gods and demons, let alone mortals like
Somakas and Sṛñjayas 9. 6. 9; a fierce battle
was fought by Sṛñjayas with Kurus which
terrorized Kurus ({%kurūṇāṃ bhayavardha-%}
{%nam%}) 9. 8. 1; as a result of the battle
there began to flow a terrific river ({%nadī%}
{%raudrā%}) filled with the bodies of Kurus
and Sṛñjayas ({%kurusṛñjayasaṃkulā%}) 9. 8.
32; seeing the heroic deeds ({%vikramam%}) of
Śalya, Duryodhana considered Pāṇḍavas,
Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas (as good as) dead
({%nihatān … mene%}) 9. 12. 28; finally, when
[Page923-a+ 40]
Śalya was killed, Pāṇḍavas and Śṛñjayas
chased the shattered ({%prabhagnān%}) army
of Kauravas 9. 18. 28; when Śālva, riding
an elephant, attacked the Pāṇḍava army,
Sṛñjayas and others thought his swiftly
moving single elephant, to be several
thousands ({%sahasraśo vai vicarantam%}
{%ekam%}) 9. 19. 6; when the Pāṇḍava army
was broken, Kaurava heroes blew, in joy,
their conches; Dhṛṣṭadyumna, the general
of the armies of Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas,
could not bear the sound of the roar indi-
cative of the joy of Kauravas (8. 19. 10);
seeing the (heroic) deeds of Śālva, Sṛñjayas
and others encircled his elephant 9. 19. 21;
during the war of eighteen days eleven
{%akṣauhiṇis%} of Duryodhana's army were
killed by Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas 9. 28.
14; Duryodhana felt confident to defeat
Pāṇḍavas, Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas with
mace as his weapon 9. 31. 30; Bhīma
told Yudhiṣṭhira, accompanied by Sṛñjayas
({%sṛñjayaiḥ saha tiṣṭhantam%}), that he was
prepared to accept the challenge of Duryo-
dhana 9. 32. 28; Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas
applauded Duryodhana's words asking
Bhīma to prove his words ({%darśayasva%}
{%balaṃ yuddhe%}) 9. 32. 49-50; when Balarāma
came to witness the duel between Bhīma
and Duryodhana, he embraced Pāṇḍavas
and Sṛñjayas and enquired about their
well being ({%apṛcchat kuśalaṃ sarvān%}) 9.
33. 11; Duryodhana asked Yudhiṣṭhira,
along with Sṛñjayas, to watch the duel
9. 54. 38-39; when Duryodhana was forced
to kneel down by Bhīma, Sṛñjayas raised
a loud roar; hearing their roar, Duryo-
dhana was enraged 9. 56. 54-55; when
Bhīma felled down Duryodhana he told
Kṛṣṇa, Pāṇḍavas and Sṛñjayas that he
[Page923-b+ 40]
had killed the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra on
the strength of Draupadī's {%tapas (raṇe%}
{%hatāṃs tapasā yājñasenyāḥ)%} 9. 58. 9-10;
Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya what did the
Sṛñjayas do when Duryodhana was struck
down; Saṃjaya told him that they waived
their upper garments and raised a loud
roar; the earth was unable to bear them
who were filled with delight ({%āvidhyan%}
{%uttarīyāṇi siṃhanādāṃś ca nedire / naitān%}
{%harṣasamāviṣṭān iyam sehe vasundharā //%})
9. 60. 3-4; some shook their bows, others
their bow-strings; still others blew their
large conches or struck the {%dundubhis;%} some
made sportive gestures, others laughed
({%cikrīḍus tathaivānye jahasuś ca%}) 9. 60.
5-6; they praised Bhīma's act in so many
words and were happy that he had brought
the enmity to an end ({%vairasya ca gataḥ%}
{%pāram%}); they said that the horripilation
experienced by them at the time of Duryo-
dhana's fall had not yet subsided ({%duryo-%}
{%dhanavadhe yāni romāṇī hṛṣitāni naḥ / adyāpi%}
{%na vihṛṣyanti tāni … %}) 9. 60. 7-16; Kṛṣṇa
told Sṛñjayas not to rebuke Duryodhana
anymore because he was already killed when
he refused to give Pāṇḍavas their share
although advised to do that, among others,
by them ({%°gāṅgevasṛñjayaiḥ / … procya-%}
{%māno 'pi%}) 9. 60. 20; (31) During the
massacre which took place at night of the
eighteenth day, Aśvatthāman killed Pāṇḍava
warriors and Sṛñjayas who were without
weapons and armours and were agitated
({%apetaśastrasaṃnāhān saṃrabdhān pāṇḍu-%}

told Aśvatthāman that they had killed
Pāñcālas and Sṛñjayas by thousands (as
they were trying to escape from the camp)
({%vinikṛttān sahasraśaḥ%}) 10. 8. 141; (32)

events to Saṃjaya, Dhṛtarāṣṭra said that
before Bhīṣma's fall he had reduced Soma-
kas to a small number ({%kṛtvā somakān%}
[Page924-b+ 40]
{%alpaśeṣān%}) 1. 1. 127; (2) At the start of
the {%svayaṃvara%} of Draupadi, the priest of
Somakas (in such contexts they are identi-
fied with Pāñcālas) gave offerings in fire,
asked Brāhmaṇas to pronounce benediction
({%brāhmaṇān svasti vācya ca%}) and then
stopped the sound of musical instruments
1. 176. 31-32; (3) Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked
Saṃjaya how strong Somakas were with
Dhṛṣṭadyumna as their general ({%dhṛṣṭa-%}
{%dyumnena senānyā somakāḥ kimbalā iva%})
5. 49. 9; (4) Duryodhana and others
thought that if Kṛṣṇa was arrested Pāṇḍa-
vas and Somakas would give up all their
effort ({%nirudyamā bhaviṣyanti%}) 5. 128. 7;
(5) When Pāṇḍavas had settled down at
Hiraṇvatī, Duryodhana sent Ulūka as his
messenger to them and Somakas 5. 157.
3; (6) Bhīṣma had assured Duryodhana
that he would kill Pāṇḍavas and Somakas
5. 170. 2; (7) Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya
how did Kurus and Pāṇḍava-Somakas
fight with one another at Kurukṣetra;
thereupon Saṃjaya described to him how
they fought when Somakas, determined to
win or die while engaged in fighting, attack-
ed Kauravas ({%āśaṃsanto jayaṃ yuddhe%}
{%vadhaṃ vābhimukhā raṇe%}) 6. 1. 1-4; Kau-
ravas and Pāṇḍava-Somakas sat together
before the start of the war and mutually
agreed upon certain conventions and
rules to be followed in the war ({%tatas te%}

rules detailed in 6. 1. 27-32; (8) Duryo-
dhana told Duḥśāsana that if Bhīṣma was
protected in war he would kill Pāṇḍavas,
Somakas and Sṛñjayas 6. 16. 14; (9) When
Arjuna got prepared for the war Somakas
[Page925-a+ 40]
and others blew their conches 6. 41. 2;
(10) On the second day of the war,
Dhṛṣṭadyumna and Somakas showered
arrows on Droṇa 6. 48. 30; (11) On the
third day, Kṛṣṇa noticed Bhīṣma routing
Somakas chased by the delighted Kauravas
({%prabhagnān dṛśya somakān%}) 6. 55. 68;
(12) On the fifth day, when Bhīṣma
started killing Pāñcālas and Somakas, they
acted nobly and decided to attack Bhīṣma
({%āryāṃ yuddhe matiṃ kṛtvā bhīṣmam%}
{%evābhidudruvuḥ%}) 6. 68. 31; (13) On the
sixth day, Śikhaṇḍin surrounded by Soma-
kas and Irāvant stood at the ‘tail’ of
the Makaravyūha of Pāṇḍavas ({%pucche%}
{%makarasya%}) 6. 71. 4, 11; Somakas were
terrified ({%vitresuḥ%}) to hear the sound of
Droṇa's conch when he blew it after defeat-
ing Drupada 6. 73. 46; (14) On the eighth
day, when the Pāṇḍava army attacked
Bhīṣma he killed Pāñcālas, Somakas and
Sṛñjayas with his arrows; nevertheless,
abandoning the fear of death they attacked
Bhīṣma ({%tyaktvā mṛtyukṛtaṃ bhayam%})
6. 84. 2-4; battle that ensued, in which
Bhīṣma cut off their hands and heads and
felled down those riding chariots, horses
and elephants ({%virathān rathinaś cakre;%}
{%hayebhyo hayasādinām; nirmanuṣyāṃś ca%}
{%mātaṅgāñ … %}), described in 6. 84. 5-7;
when Droṇa attacked Somakas and Sṛñjayas
in order to kill them ({%abhyadravata … %}

raised by Sṛñjayas (by implication also by
Somakas) ({%tatrākrando mahān āsīt sṛñja-%}

assured Duryodhana that he would kill all
Pārthas and Somakas if Bhīṣma laid down
his arms and left the battlefield 6. 93. 13;
Duryodhana then went to Bhīṣma and
[Page925-b+ 40]
reminded him that he had assured him
(Duryodhana) to kill Somakas; he asked
Bhīṣma to carry out his assurance by killing
Somakas 6. 93. 37-38; thereupon Bhīṣma
once again assured Duryodhana that next
day he would either kill Somakas and Pāñ-
cālas to delight him or they would kill
him ({%tair vāhaṃ nihataḥ saṃkhye gamiṣye%}
{%yamasādanam / tān vā nihatya saṃgrāme%}

(15) On the ninth day, in the morning,
Duryodhana asked the kings to get ready
with their armies since Bhīṣma was going
to kill that day Somakas ({%adya bhīṣmo … %}
{%nihaniṣyati somakān%}) 6. 95. 1; at mid-day,
Bhīṣma fought a fierce battle with Somakas
blowing them away by hundreds and thou-
sands with his sharp arrows ({%vyadhaman%}
{% … śataśo 'tha sahasraśaḥ%}) 6. 99. 1-2;
in the evening when the sun had set
({%bhāskare 'stam upāgate%} 6. 103. 1), Yudhi-
ṣṭhira seeing that great chariot-fighters
among Somakas had been defeated and
had lost enthusiasm ({%jitān dṛṣtvā … nirut-%}
{%sāhān mahārathān%}) felt like ordering
cessation of hostilities for that day ({%ava-%}
{%hāram arocayat%}) 6. 103. 4; (16) Dhṛta-
rāṣṭra asked Saṃjaya how, on the tenth
day, did Bhīṣma face Pāṇḍavas while at
the same time killing Somakas 6. 104. 25;
Dhṛṣṭadyumna, aided by Somakas, attack-
ed Droṇa 6. 111. 30; Bhīṣma, when attack-
ed by Śikhaṇḍin, killed Somakas who
followed Arjuna ({%pārthapadānugān%}) 6.
112. 64; none of the great chariot-fighters
of Somakas hoped to live after facing
Bhīṣma in battle ({%na … yaḥ saṃprāpya raṇe%}
{%bhīṣmaṃ jīvite sma mano dadhe%}) 6. 112.
75; exhorted by Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Somakas
and Sṛñjayas rushed at Bhīṣma showering
[Page926-a+ 40]
weapons on him from all sides ({%abhyadra-%}
{%vanta … śastravṛṣṭyā samantataḥ%}) 6. 113.
16-17; Somakas and Pāñcālas were delight-
ed when Bhīṣma fell down 6. 114. 107;
(17) On the fourteenth day, when Droṇa
started killing Somakas no one succeeded
in facing him, nor was any one able to
pierce him (with an arrow) ({%na cāpya-%}
{%bhiyayuḥ kecid apare naiva vivyadhuḥ%}) 7.
85. 34; watching the fierce duel between
Satyasena and Sātyaki, Kauravas and
Somakas praised them 7. 94. 7; in the
afternoon of that day, Droṇa again fought
with Somakas ({%aparāhṇe … saṃgrāmaḥ%}
{%samapadyata / … punar droṇasya somakalḥ%})
7. 101. 1; when the different alignments of
the Pāṇḍava army were being agitated by
Droṇa ({%vyūheṣv āloḍyamāneṣu%}), Pāṇḍavas,
Pāñcālas and Somakas went deep into the
army of Kauravas ({%sudūram anvayuḥ%}); the
battle fought was so fierce that it looked
like the end of the world ({%yugānta iva%}
{%bhārata%}) 7. 102. 1-2; when Bhīma
marched to offer assistance to Arjuna,
Pāñcālas and Somakas followed him 7.
102. 67; after the death of Jayadratha, in
the evening ({%astaṃ gacchati bhāskare%}),
Droṇa fought a fierce battle with Somakas
({%somakaiḥ sārdham saṃgrāmo lomaharṣa-%}
{%ṇaḥ%}); at that time great chariot-fighters
of Somakas made every attempt to kill
Droṇa ({%te tu sarve prayatnena bhāradvājaṃ%}
{%jighāṃsavaḥ / … ayudhyanta mahārathāḥ //%})
7. 121. 45-46; Droṇa sent a message to
Aśvatthāman through Duryodhana not to
spare Somakas in order to save his own
life ({%na somakāḥ pramoktavyā jīvitaṃ%}
{%parirakṣatā%}) 7. 126. 33; (18) In the
night war (which took place between the
fourteenth and the fifteenth day), Duryo-
[Page926-b+ 40]
dhana assured his fleeing army that he
would himself kill Pārthas together with
Pāñcālas and Somakas 7. 134. 54: Duryo-
dhana requested Aśvatthāman to kill
Pāñcālas and Somakas who, agitated, were
moving in his army like a conflagration;
he should kill them before they killed
Kauravas ({%ete hi somakā … mama sainyeṣu%}
{%saṃrabdhā vicaranti davāgnivat%}) 7. 134.
76-78; Aśvatthāman assured Duryodhana
that for his sake and to delight him he
would fight with Pāñcālas, Somakas and
Kekayas ({%eṣa gacchāmi saṃgrāme tvat-%}
{%kṛte … / … tvatpriyārtham%}); scorched by
his arrows, Somakas and others would
run away in all directions; seeing his
valour, Yudhiṣṭhira and Somakas would
consider the world full of Aśvatthāman
({%aśvatthāmamayaṃ lokaṃ maṃsyante%});
Yudhiṣṭhira would be dejected seeing the
slain Pāñcālas and Somakas; Aśvatthāman
would kill only those who engaged him in
battle ({%ye māṃ yuddhe 'bhiyotsyanti tān%}

Yudhiṣṭhira exhorted Pāṇḍavas and Soma-

Vṛṣasena cut off the armours of Drupada's

turned back, Somakas and others covered
him on all sides; then the battle started
again 7. 144. 25, 27-28; seeing Droṇa kill-

Somakas quickly pierced him by showering
arrows ({%vivyadhuḥ somakās tūrṇaṃ … %}

attacked Droṇa and Karṇa ({%vṛtaḥ somaka-%}
{%pāṇḍavaiḥ%}) 7. 147. 28; when only the three
parts of the (last quarter of the) night

Droṇa divided his army into two parts and
attacked Somakas and Pāṇḍavas along with
Pāñcālas ({%tribhāgamātraśeṣāyām rātryāṃ;%}

made to stand still where they were by
Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna (7. 171. 67-69; 7. 172.

Even after the battle of the sixteenth day,
Dhṛtarāṣṭra was confident that Karṇa alone
was capable of killing Pāṇḍavas and Soma-

day, Arjuna felt that by killing Karṇa he
would give satisfaction to the great chariot-

their task to help their allies in war ({%kṛtaṃ%}

were not killed they would cause the des-

urged ({%abhyakrośan%}) Arjuna to hasten to
pierce Karṇa (with an arrow), cut off his
head without delay and shatter the hope
of Duryodhana to get kingdom ({%vidhya%}

Arjuna stopped them ({%tadantaraṃ somakāḥ%}
{%prādravanta / … pārthaḥ somakān pratya-%}
{%gṛhṇāt%}) 8. 65. 32-34; seeing Karṇa lying
dead on the ground, Somakas, delighted,
made loud noise, sounded musical instru-
ments and shook their (upper) garments
and hands; others danced and embraced
each other saying: “Karṇa is pierced with
an arrow as fire is extinguished by a strong
wind at the end of a sacrifice or at day-
break in a bedroom; Karṇa's body with
arrows all over it and smeared with blood
shines like sun with his rays; the sun in
the form of Karṇa has been forced to set
by Kāla in the form of Arjuna; as the sun
while setting takes away his light, so has
the arrow taken away Karṇa's life” 8.
[Page928-b+ 39]
67. 28-32; after the death of Karṇa, in the
evening, at the foot of the Himavant
({%haimavate prasthe%} 9. 5. 1) and near the
river Sarasvatī (9. 4. 49), Śalya when
requested by Duryodhana to lead the army
(9. 5. 26-27), he (Śalya) assured him that
he would defeat Pārthas and Somakas in
battle 9. 6. 3; after Śalya's election as the
general, the great chariot-fighters of Madra-
kas while praising Śalya said that he was
capable of defeating in battle even gods,
demons and men, let alone Somakas and
Sṛñjayas ({%kimu somakasṛñjayān%}) 9. 6. 9;
that night, in the camp of Pāṇḍavas, Kṛṣṇa
encouraged Yudhiṣṭhira to fight with Śalya;
after he left, Yudhiṣṭhira gave leave to
Pāñcālas and Somakas to leave his camp
({%visṛjya pāñcālān atha somakān%}) 9. 6. 39;

Duryodhana alone halted ({%avārayat%}) with

Duryodhana who had taken shelter in the
Dvaipāyana lake that he would kill Soma-

Pāṇḍavas were afraid when they noticed
the velocity of the wind produced by
Duryodhana's mace ({%gadā mārutavegaṃ hi%}
{%dṛṣṭvā%}) 9. 56. 31; when at one stage
Bhīma lost consciousness due to the stroke
of Duryodhana's mace on his chest, Soma-
kas and Pāṇḍavas, their hopes dashed to
the ground, became dejected ({%bhṛśopahata-%}

49; Somakas were thrilled to see Duryo-

whether Kṛpa and Kṛtavarman took part
in destroying the camp of Pāṇḍavas and in
killing them and Somakas while fighting,
and then go the way Duryodhana did
(i. e. die in battle) ({%kaccit pramathya%}

Yudhiṣṭhira in reply to his question:
What is most profitable among the three

(2. 263. 1-2); in the narrative, Kuṇḍadhāra
obliges a Brāhmaṇa due to affection for
his devotee ({%kuṇḍadhāreṇa yat prītyā%}
{%bhaktāyopakṛtaṃ purā%}) 12. 263. 2-55;
the narrative runs as follows: A certain
poor Brāhmaṇa desired to obtain wealth
in order to perform a sacrifice; he therefore
worshipped many deities but did not get
wealth; he then wondered which could be
that one deity which would show him favour
[Page936-a+ 40]
quickly; he then saw standing near him
the cloud Kuṇḍadhāra ({%jaladharaṃ kuṇḍa-%}
{%dhāraṃ%} st. 6) who appeared before him
assuming an agreeable form ({%saumyena%}
{%vapuṣā%} st. 6); the Brāhmaṇa felt assured
by Kuṇḍadhāra's form and felt that he
would definitely give him ample wealth;
the Brāhmaṇa became his devotee and
worshipped Kuṇḍadhāra with incenses,
perfumes, garlands and oblations ({%tato%}
{%dhūpaiś ca gandhaiś ca mālyair uccāvacair%}
{%api /balibhiś cāpi … ,%} st. 9); the cloud,
satisfied, told the Brāhmaṇa that there were
expiations for the sins committed due to
killing a Brāhmaṇa, drinking wine, theft,
breaking a vow, but there was no expiation
for the sin of ungratefulness ({%kṛtaghne%}
{%nāsti niṣkṛtiḥ%} st. 11); {%adharma%} was the
child of craving, anger of envy, greed of
insult ({%nikṛtyāḥ%}), and that an ungrateful
person did not deserve progeny ({%kṛtaghno%}
{%nārhati prajām%} st. 12); then the Brāhmaṇa,
lying on the {%kuśa%} grass, due to the lustre
({%tejas%}) of Kuṇḍadhāra, saw in a dream
({%nidarśanam apaśyata%} st. 14), Maṇibhadra
distributing kingdoms and wealth as desir-
ed by gods ({%maṇibhadraṃ vyādiśantam … /%}
{%tatra devāḥ prayacchanti rājyāni ca%}
{%dhanāni ca%} st. 15-16); Kuṇḍadhāra fell
at the feet of Maṇibhadra; Maṇibhadra, at
the instance of gods, asked Kuṇḍadhāra
what he desired; Kuṇḍadhāra replied that if
the gods were satisfied with him they should
show that kind of favour to the Brāhmaṇa
which would lead him to happiness ({%asyā-%}
{%nugraham icchāmi kṛtaṃ kiṃcit sukho-%}
{%dayam%} st. 19); again, at the instance of
the gods, Maṇibhadra told Kuṇḍadhāra
that he was willing to give the Brāhmaṇa
as much wealth as desired by him; Kuṇḍa-
[Page936-b+ 40]
dhāra then, reflecting that a man's (wealth)
was fickle, decided to fix the Brāhmaṇa's
mind on practising austerities ({%vicārya%}
{%kuṇḍadhāras tu mānuṣaṃ calam adhruvam /%}
{%tapase matim ādhatta brāhmaṇasya yaśas-%}
{%vinaḥ%}) 12. 263. 22; Kuṇḍadhāra therefore
told Maṇibhadra that he would not seek
wealth for the Brāhmaṇa, but that the
Brāhmaṇa be devoted to {%dharma;%} he desir-
ed that the Brāhmaṇa should take delight
in {%dharma%} and should live following the
{%dharma (bhaved eṣa tu dhārmikaḥ / dharme%}
{%'sya ramatāṃ buddhir dharmaṃ caivopa-%}
{%jīvatu / )%} 12. 263. 25; when Maṇibhadra
persisted on giving the Brāhmaṇa kingdom
and various kinds of happiness since that
was what one aspired to get by follow-
ing {%dharma,%} Kuṇḍadhāra did not change
his mind and wanted his Brāhmaṇa devotee
to live following the {%dharma;%} the gods
were pleased with him; Maṇibhadra told
Kuṇḍadhāra that the gods were satisfied
with him and that the Brāhmaṇa's mind
would be fixed on {%dharma%} and that he would
be a {%dharmātmā;%} Kuṇḍadhāra was delight-
ed for having obtained what was desired in
the form of a boon not easily obtained by
others; the Brāhmaṇa saw thin garments
around him but his mind was not deluded;
abandoning them, he went to the forest
and practised severe austerities; he felt that
if he so desired he could certainly give
some one even kingdom (12. 263. 30-39);
at that juncture Kuṇḍadhāra again appeared
before the Brāhmaṇa due to his friendship
with him and the severe austerities per-
formed by him; the Brāhmaṇa, surprised,
received him according to the rites; Kuṇḍa-
dhāra told the Brāhmaṇa that he had now
obtained the highest divine insight ({%divyaṃ%}
[Page937-a+ 40]
{%te cakṣur uttamam%} 12. 263. 42) and by
using it the Brāhmaṇa should see the ulti-
mate fate of the kings and the worlds
they would get; then the Brāhmaṇa by his
divine eye saw thousands of kings sunk in
the hell; Kuṇḍadhāra wondered that if the
Brāhmaṇa, after worshipping him was to
get unhappiness, what kind of favour had
he done to him ? He therefore asked the
Brāhmaṇa (to use his divine eye and) to
realize that it was futile to run after various
longings because the door to heaven was
closed for such men ({%kāmān icched kathaṃ%}
{%naraḥ / svargadvāraṃ hi saṃruddhaṃ mānu-%}
{%ṣeṣu viśeṣataḥ //%} 12. 263. 45); the Brāhmaṇa
then saw that lust, anger, greed, fear,
arrogance, sleep, drowsiness, laziness hinder
men from going to heaven ({%tato 'paśyat sa%}
{%kāmaṃ ca krodhaṃ lobhaṃ bhayaṃ madam /%}
{%nidrāṃ tandrīṃ tathālasyam āvṛtya puruṣān%}
{%sthitān // %} 12. 263. 46); Kuṇḍadhāra again
told the Brāhmaṇa that the vices, mentioned
before, stopped men from going to heaven;
gods were afraid of such men; (these vices),
as ordained by the gods, create obstacles
all around ({%tathaiva devavacanād vighnaṃ%}
{%kurvanti sarvaśaḥ //%} 12. 263. 47); no one
who was not permitted by gods could be
virtuous; the Brāhmaṇa, due to his auste-
rities, could confer kingdoms and wealth
on others; the Brāhmaṇa fell at the feet
of the cloud ({%toyadhāriṇe%} i. e. Kuṇḍa-
dhāra) and told him that he had done a
great favour to him; he requested Kuṇḍa-
dhāra to forgive him for having formerly
envied him ({%purā te yad asūyitam%}) due
to his hankerings and greed; Kuṇḍadhāra
embraced the Brāhmaṇa and told him that
he had forgiven him and then disappeared;
the Brāhmaṇa then roamed through the
[Page937-b+ 40]
skies due to his austerities to which he was
led by Kuṇḍadhāra; due to his virtuousness
he also gained what he wanted and the
highest bliss ({%vihāyasā ca gamanaṃ tathā%}
