2. {@Akṣa.@}¦ — This word occurs frequently, from the Rigveda
<div n="lb"/>onwards, both in the singular and plural, meaning ‘die’ and
<div n="lb"/>‘dice.’ Dicing, along with horse-racing, was one of the main
<div n="lb"/>amusements of the Vedic Indian; but, despite the frequent
<div n="lb"/>mention of the game in the literature, there is considerable
<div n="lb"/>difficulty in obtaining any clear picture of the mode in which it
<div n="lb"/>was played.
<div n="P"/>(1) {%The Material.%} — The dice appear normally to have been
<div n="lb"/>made of Vibhīdaka nuts. Such dice are alluded to in both the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and the Atharvaveda,<sup>2</sup> hence being called ‘brown’
<div n="lb"/>({%babhru%}), and ‘born on a windy spot.’<sup>3</sup> In the ritual game of
<div n="lb"/>dice at the Agnyādheya and the Rājasūya ceremonies the
<div n="lb"/>material of the dice is not specified, but it is possible that
<div n="lb"/>occasionally gold imitations of Vibhīdaka nuts were used.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="lb"/>There is no clear trace in the Vedic literature of the later use
<div n="lb"/>of cowries as dice.<sup>5</sup>
<div n="P"/>(2) {%The Number.%} — In the Rigveda<sup>6</sup> the dicer is described as
<div n="lb"/>‘leader of a great horde’ ({%senānīr mahato gaṇasya%}), and in
<div n="lb"/>another passage<sup>7</sup> the number is given as {%tri-pañcāśaḥ,%} an expres-
<div n="lb"/>sion which has been variously interpreted. Ludwig,<sup>8</sup> Weber,<sup>9</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and Zimmer<sup>10</sup> render it as fifteen, which is grammatically
<div n="lb"/>hardly possible. Roth<sup>11</sup> and Grassmann<sup>12</sup> render it as ‘con-
<div n="lb"/>sisting of fifty-three.’ Lüders<sup>13</sup> takes it as ‘consisting of one
<div n="lb"/>hundred and fifty,’ but he points out that this may be merely a
<div n="lb"/>vague expression for a large number. For a small number
<div n="lb"/>Zimmer<sup>14</sup> cites a reference in the Rigveda<sup>15</sup> to one who fears
<div n="lb"/>‘him who holds four’ ({%caturaś cid dadamānāt%}), but the sense of
<div n="lb"/>that passage is dependent on the view taken of the method of
<div n="lb"/>playing the game.
<div n="P"/>(3) {%The Method of Play.%} — In several passages of the later
[Page1-003+ 49]
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas lists are given of expressions con-
<div n="lb"/>nected with dicing. The names are Kṛta, Tretā, Dvāpara,
<div n="lb"/>Āskanda, and Abhibhū in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā.<sup>16</sup> In the
<div n="lb"/>Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā,<sup>17</sup> among the victims at the Puruṣamedha,
<div n="lb"/>the {%kitava%} is offered to the Akṣarāja, the {%ādinava-darśa%} to the
<div n="lb"/>Kṛta, the {%kalpin%} to the Tretā, the {%adhi-kalpin%} to the Dvāpara,
<div n="lb"/>the {%sabhā-sthāṇu%} to the Āskanda. The lists in the parallel
<div n="lb"/>version of the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa are {%kitava, sabhāvin, ādinava-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%darśa, bahiḥ-sad,%} and {%sabhā-sthāṇu,%}<sup>18</sup> and Aksarāja, Kṛta, Tretā,
<div n="lb"/>Dvāpara, and Kali. From the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>19</sup> it appears
<div n="lb"/>that another name of Kali was Abhibhū, and the parallel lists
<div n="lb"/>in the Taittirīya and Vājasaneyi Saṃhitās suggest that Abhibhū
<div n="lb"/>and Akṣarāja are identical, though both appear in the late
<div n="lb"/>Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa list. The names of some of these throws
<div n="lb"/>go back even to the Rigveda and the Atharvaveda. Kali occurs
<div n="lb"/>in the latter,<sup>20</sup> and Lüders<sup>21</sup> shows that in a considerable number
<div n="lb"/>of passages in the former Kṛta means a ‘throw’ (not ‘a stake’<sup>22</sup>
<div n="lb"/>or ‘what is won’<sup>23</sup> and this sense is clearly found in the
<div n="lb"/>Atharvaveda.<sup>24</sup> Moreover, that there were more throws ({%ayāḥ%})
<div n="lb"/>than one is proved by a passage in the Rigveda,<sup>25</sup> when
<div n="lb"/>the gods are compared to throws as giving or destroying
<div n="lb"/>wealth.
<div n="P"/>The nature of the throws is obscure. The St. Petersburg
<div n="lb"/>Dictionary conjectures that the names given above were applied
<div n="lb"/>either to dice marked 4, 3, 2, or 1, or to the sides of the dice so
<div n="lb"/>marked, and the latter interpretation is supported by some late
<div n="lb"/>commentators.<sup>26</sup> But there is no evidence for the former
<div n="lb"/>interpretation, and, as regards the latter, the shape of the
<div n="lb"/>Vibhīdaka nuts,<sup>27</sup> used as dice, forbids any side being properly
<div n="lb"/>on the top. Light is thrown on the expressions by the descrip-
[Page1-004+ 52]
<div n="lb"/>tion of a ritual game<sup>28</sup> at the Agnyādheya and at the Rājasūya
<div n="lb"/>ceremonies. The details are not certain,<sup>29</sup> but it is clear that
<div n="lb"/>the game consisted in securing even numbers of dice, usually a
<div n="lb"/>number divisible by four, the Kṛta, the other three throws then
<div n="lb"/>being the Tretā, when three remained over after division by
<div n="lb"/>four; the Dvāpara, when two was the remainder; and the Kali,
<div n="lb"/>when one remained. If five were the dividing number, then the
<div n="lb"/>throw which showed no remainder was Kali, the Kṛta was that
<div n="lb"/>when four was left, and so on. The dice had no numerals
<div n="lb"/>marked on them, the only question being what was the total
<div n="lb"/>number of the dice themselves.
<div n="P"/>There is no reason to doubt that the game as played in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda was based on the same principle, though the details
<div n="lb"/>must remain doubtful. The number of dice used was certainly
<div n="lb"/>large,<sup>30</sup> and the reference to throwing fours,<sup>31</sup> and losing by one,
<div n="lb"/>points to the use of the Kṛta as the winning throw. The
<div n="lb"/>Atharvaveda,<sup>32</sup> on the other hand, possibly knew of the Kali as
<div n="lb"/>the winning throw. In one respect the ordinary game must
<div n="lb"/>have differed from the ritual game. In the latter the players
<div n="lb"/>merely pick out the number of dice required — no doubt to avoid
<div n="lb"/>ominous errors, such as must have happened if a real game had
<div n="lb"/>been played. In the secular game the dice were thrown,<sup>33</sup>
<div n="lb"/>perhaps on the principle suggested by Lüders:<sup>34</sup> the one
<div n="lb"/>throwing a certain number on the place of playing, and the other
<div n="lb"/>then throwing a number to make up with those already thrown
<div n="lb"/>a multiple of four or five. This theory, at any rate, accounts for
<div n="lb"/>the later stress laid on the power of computation in a player,
<div n="lb"/>as in the Nala.
<div n="P"/>No board appears to have been used, but a depression on which
[Page1-005+ 60]
<div n="lb"/>the dice were thrown ({%adhi-devana, devana,%}<sup>35</sup> {%iriṇa%}<sup>36</sup> ), was made
<div n="lb"/>in the ground. No dice box was used, but reference is made to
<div n="lb"/>a case for keeping dice in ({%akṣa-vapana%}<sup>37</sup> The throw was called
<div n="lb"/>{%graha%}<sup>38</sup> or earlier {%grābha.%}<sup>39</sup> The stake is called {%vij.%}<sup>40</sup> Serious
<div n="lb"/>losses could be made at dicing: in the Rigveda a dicer laments
<div n="lb"/>the loss of all his property, including his wife.<sup>41</sup> Lüders<sup>42</sup> finds
<div n="lb"/>a different form of the game referred to in the Chāndogya

<L>11<pc>1-006<k1>agastya<k2>agastya
{@Agastya.@}¦ — This is the name of a sage, of mythical character,
<div n="lb"/>who plays a great part in the later literature. He was a {@Māna,@}<sup>1</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and therefore is called {@Mānya@}<sup>2</sup> and son of Māna, and only once
<div n="lb"/>is there a reference<sup>3</sup> to the legend prevalent in latter times that
<div n="lb"/>he was a son of Mitra and Varuṇa.
<div n="P"/>His greatest feat was the reconciliation of Indra and the
<div n="lb"/>Maruts after Indra had been annoyed at his proposing to give
<div n="lb"/>the Maruts an offering to the exclusion of Indra. This feat is
<div n="lb"/>the subject of three hymns of the Rigveda,<sup>4</sup> and is often referred
[Page1-007+ 62]
<div n="lb"/>to in the Brāhmaṇas,<sup>5</sup> though the exact details and significance
<div n="lb"/>of the legend are variously treated by Oldenberg,<sup>6</sup> Sieg,<sup>7</sup> Hertel,<sup>8</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and von Schroeder.<sup>9</sup>
<div n="P"/>He also appears in a strange dialogue with Lopāmudrā in
<div n="lb"/>the Rigveda,<sup>10</sup> which appears to show him as an ascetic who
<div n="lb"/>finally yields to temptation. Von {@Schroeder@}<sup>11</sup> regards it as
<div n="lb"/>a ritual drama of vegetation magic.
<div n="P"/>In another passage of the Rigveda<sup>12</sup> he appears as helping
<div n="lb"/>in the Aśvins’ gift of a leg to Viśpalā. Sāyaṇa holds that be
<div n="lb"/>was the Purohita of {@Khela,@} and Sieg<sup>13</sup> accepts this view, while
<div n="lb"/>Pischel<sup>14</sup> thinks that Khela is a deity, Vivasvant.
<div n="P"/>Geldner<sup>15</sup> shows from the Rigveda<sup>16</sup> that Agastya, as brother
<div n="lb"/>of Vasiṣṭha — both being miraculous sons of Mitra and Varuṇa
<div n="lb"/>-introduces {@Vasiṣṭha@} to the {@Tṛtsus.@} There are two other
<div n="lb"/>references to Agastya in the Rigveda, the one<sup>17</sup> including him
<div n="lb"/>in a long list of persons, the other alluding to his sister's sons
<div n="lb"/>({%nadbhyaḥ%}),<sup>18</sup> apparently {@Bandhu,@} etc. In the Atharvaveda<sup>19</sup>
<div n="lb"/>he appears as connected with witchcraft, and in a long list of
<div n="lb"/>sages.<sup>20</sup> In the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā<sup>21</sup> cows, with a peculiar

<L>13<pc>1-008<k1>agnidagDa<k2>agnidagDa
{@Agni-dagdha.@}¦ — This epithet (‘burnt with fire’)<sup>1</sup> applies to
<div n="lb"/>the dead who were burned on the funeral pyre. This is one
<div n="lb"/>of the two normal methods of disposing of the dead, the other
<div n="lb"/>being burial ({%an-agnidagdhāḥ,%} ‘not burnt with fire’).<sup>2</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>Atharvaveda<sup>3</sup> adds two further modes of disposal to those — 
<div n="lb"/>viz., casting out ({%paroptāḥ%}), and the exposure of the dead
<div n="lb"/>({%uddhitāḥ%}). The exact sense of these expressions is doubtful.
<div n="lb"/>Zimmer<sup>4</sup> considers that the former is a parallel to the Iranian
<div n="lb"/>practice of casting out the dead to be devoured by beasts, and
<div n="lb"/>that the latter refers to the old who are exposed when helpless.<sup>5</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Whitney<sup>6</sup> refers the latter expression to the exposure of the
<div n="lb"/>dead body on a raised platform of some sort.
<div n="P"/>Burial was clearly not rare in the Rigvedic period: a whole
<div n="lb"/>hymn<sup>7</sup> describes the ritual attending it. The dead man was
<div n="lb"/>buried apparently in full attire, with his bow in his hand, and
<div n="lb"/>probably at one time his wife was immolated to accompany
<div n="lb"/>him, in accordance with a practice common among savage
<div n="lb"/>tribes. But in the Vedic period both customs appear in a
<div n="lb"/>modified form: the son takes the bow from the hand of the
<div n="lb"/>dead man, and the widow is led away from her dead husband
<div n="lb"/>by his brother or other nearest kinsman. A stone is set
<div n="lb"/>between the dead and the living to separate them. In the
<div n="lb"/>Atharvaveda,<sup>8</sup> but not in the Rigveda, a coffin ({%vṛkṣa%}) is alluded
<div n="lb"/>to. In both Saṃhitās<sup>9</sup> occur other allusions to the ‘house
<div n="lb"/>of earth’ ({%bhūmi-gṛha%}). To remove the apparent discrepancy
<div n="lb"/>between burning and burial, by assuming that the references to
<div n="lb"/>burial are to the burial of the burned bones, as does Oldenberg,<sup>10</sup>
<div n="lb"/>is unnecessary and improbable, as burning and burial subsisted
<div n="lb"/>side by side in Greece for many years.
<div n="P"/>Burning was, however, equally usual, and it grew steadily
<div n="lb"/>in frequency, for in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad<sup>11</sup> the adornment
[Page1-009+ 56]
<div n="lb"/>of the body of the dead with curd ({@Āmikṣā@}), clothes, and
<div n="lb"/>ornaments, in order to win the next world, is referred to as
<div n="lb"/>something erroneous and wrong, and in the funeral Mantras of
<div n="lb"/>the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>12</sup> only burning seems to be contemplated;
<div n="lb"/>the verses which refer to burial here really alluding to the burial
<div n="lb"/>of the ashes in the burying-ground ({%śmaśāna%}).<sup>13</sup> The body was
<div n="lb"/>wrapped in fat,<sup>14</sup> as we learn from the funeral hymn in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda, a goat being apparently burned with it,<sup>15</sup> to act as
<div n="lb"/>a guide on the way to the next world. According to the
<div n="lb"/>Atharvaveda<sup>16</sup> a draft-ox was burned presumably for the dead
<div n="lb"/>to ride with in the next world. It was expected that the dead
<div n="lb"/>would revive with his whole body and all his limbs ({%sarva-tanūḥ%}
<div n="lb"/>{%sāṅgaḥ%}),<sup>17</sup> although it is also said<sup>18</sup> that the eye goes to the sun,
<div n="lb"/>the breath to the wind, and so forth.
<div n="P"/>Before burial or burning, the corpse was washed,<sup>19</sup> a clog
<div n="lb"/>({%kūdī%}) being tied to the foot to prevent the deceased returning
<div n="lb"/>to earth.<sup>20</sup>

<div n="lb"/>of these terms is quite obscure. The commentators refer them

<div n="lb"/>and thinks that the Aṅkau were the upper border of the body
<div n="lb"/>of the chariot ({%kośa, vandhura%}), and the Nyaṅkau the lower rims
<div n="lb"/>for greater security. Oldenberg<sup>5</sup> confesses that the exact sense

<div n="lb"/>from the ritual that the boards were not placed one over the
<div n="lb"/>other, but were placed one behind the other, the two serving
<div n="lb"/>as a foundation upon which the Soma was pressed by a stone.
<div n="lb"/>This theory seems to account best for the etymological sense
<div n="lb"/>of the name ‘over-press,’ as well as for the use of the word as
<div n="lb"/>an adjective (‘used for pressing {%upon%}’). But according to the
<div n="lb"/>procedure as witnessed by Haug<sup>5</sup> in the Deccan, the shoots of

{@Ayas.@}¦ — The exact metal denoted by this word when used by
<div n="lb"/>itself, as always in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> is uncertain. As favouring the
<div n="lb"/>sense of ‘bronze’ rather than that of ‘iron’ may perhaps be
<div n="lb"/>cited with Zimmer<sup>2</sup> the fact that Agni is called {%ayo-daṃṣṭra,%}
<div n="lb"/>‘with teeth of Ayas,’<sup>3</sup> with reference to the colour of his flames,
<div n="lb"/>and that the car-seat of Mitra and Varuṇa is called {%ayaḥ-sthūṇa,%}<sup>4</sup>
<div n="lb"/>‘with pillars of Ayas’ at the setting of the sun.<sup>5</sup> Moreover,
<div n="lb"/>in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā,<sup>6</sup> Ayas is enumerated in a list of six
<div n="lb"/>metals: gold ({%hiraṇya%}), Ayas, Śyāma, Loha, lead ({%sīsa%}), tin
<div n="lb"/>({%trapu%}). Here {%śyāma%} (‘swarthy’) and {%loha%} (‘red’) must mean
<div n="lb"/>‘iron’ and ‘copper’ respectively; {%ayas%} would therefore seem to
<div n="lb"/>mean ‘bronze.’ In many passages in the Atharvaveda<sup>7</sup> and
[Page1-032+ 48]
<div n="lb"/>other books, the Ayas is divided into two species — the {%śyāma%}
<div n="lb"/>(‘iron’) and the {%lohita%} (‘copper’ or ‘bronze’). In the Śatapatha
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa<sup>8</sup> a distinction is drawn between Ayas and {%lohāyasa,%}
<div n="lb"/>which may either be a distinction between iron and copper as
<div n="lb"/>understood by Eggeling,<sup>9</sup> or between copper and bronze as held
<div n="lb"/>by Schrader.<sup>10</sup> In one passage of the Atharvaveda,<sup>11</sup> the sense of
<div n="lb"/>iron seems certain. Possibly, too, the arrow of the Rigveda,<sup>12</sup>
<div n="lb"/>which had a tip of Ayas ({%yasyā ayo mukham%}), was pointed
<div n="lb"/>with iron. Copper, however, is conceivable, and bronze quite
<div n="lb"/>likely.
<div n="P"/>Iron is called {%śyāma ayas%} or {%śyāma%} alone.<sup>13</sup> See also
<div n="lb"/>{@Kārṣṇāyasa.@} Copper is {@Lohāyasa@} or {@Lohitāyasa.@}
<div n="P"/>The smelting ({%dhmā%} ‘to blow’) of the metal is frequently
<div n="lb"/>referred to. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>14</sup> states that if ‘well
<div n="lb"/>smelted’ ({%bahu-dhmātam%}) it is like gold, referring evidently to
<div n="lb"/>bronze. A heater of Ayas is mentioned in the Vājasaneyi

{@Arya.@}¦ — This word is not common in the older literature, in

<div n="lb"/>in thinking that in several passages of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>4</sup>
<div n="lb"/>the word has the same sense as {@Ārya,@} and this appears probable.
<div n="lb"/>Whether it is necessary to ascribe this sense to the word in the
<div n="lb"/>compound {%arya-patnī%}<sup>5</sup> applied to the waters set free by Indra,
<div n="lb"/>is more doubtful. The commentator, Mahīdhara,<sup>6</sup> suggests
<div n="lb"/>that the word means a {@Vaiśya,@} not an {@Ārya@} generally. This
<div n="lb"/>view is supported by the explanation in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>7</sup>
<div n="lb"/>of one of the passages of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā.<sup>8</sup> But though

{@Aśva@}¦ is the commonest word for ‘horse’ in the Vedic
<div n="lb"/>literature. The horse is also called ‘the runner’ ({%atya%}), ‘the
<div n="lb"/>swift’ ({%arvant%}), ‘the strong,’ for pulling ({%vājin%}), ‘the runner’
<div n="lb"/>({%sapti%}), and ‘the speeding’ ({%haya%}). The mare is termed {%aśvā,%}
<div n="lb"/>{%atyā, arvatī, vaḍavā,%} etc. Horses of various colour were known,
<div n="lb"/>dun ({%harita, hari%}), ruddy ({%aruṇa, aruṣa, piśaṅga, rohita%}), dark
<div n="lb"/>brown ({%śyāva%}), white ({%śveta%}), etc. A white horse with black
<div n="lb"/>ears is mentioned in the Atharvaveda as of special value.<sup>1</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Horses were highly prized,<sup>2</sup> and were not rare, as Roth<sup>3</sup>
<div n="lb"/>thought, for as many as four hundred mares are mentioned in
<div n="lb"/>one Dānastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’).<sup>4</sup> They were on occasion
<div n="lb"/>ornamented with pearls and gold.<sup>5</sup>
<div n="P"/>Mares were preferred for drawing chariots because of their
<div n="lb"/>swiftness and sureness.<sup>6</sup> They were also used for drawing
<div n="lb"/>carts, but were not ordinarily so employed.<sup>7</sup> No mention is
<div n="lb"/>made of riding in battle, but for other purposes it was not
<div n="lb"/>unknown.<sup>8</sup>
<div n="P"/>Horses were often kept in stalls,<sup>9</sup> and fed there.<sup>10</sup> But they
<div n="lb"/>were also allowed to go out to grass,<sup>11</sup> and were then hobbled.<sup>12</sup>
<div n="lb"/>They were watered to cool them after racing.<sup>13</sup> Their attendants
[Page1-043+ 59]
<div n="lb"/>are frequently referred to ({%aśva-pāla,%}<sup>14</sup> {%aśva-pa,%}<sup>15</sup> {%aśva-pati%}).<sup>16</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Stallions were frequently castrated ({%vadhri%}).<sup>17</sup>

<div n="lb"/>the Ṛigveda,<sup>1</sup> and which Roth<sup>2</sup> was at first inclined to interpret
[Page1-046+ 46]
<div n="lb"/>as a proper name. There can, however, be no doubt that
<div n="lb"/>it means a cow, not a man, as suggested by Grassmann. The
<div n="lb"/>exact reason why a cow should be so described is uncertain.
<div n="lb"/>Roth<sup>3</sup> was later inclined to see in it the sense ‘having pierced
<div n="lb"/>ears,’ similar epithets being at a later period known to Pāṇini<sup>4</sup>
<div n="lb"/>({%bhinna-karṇa, chinna-karṇa%}). Grassmann's more obvious
<div n="lb"/>rendering, ‘having the sign for (the number) 8 marked on the ear,’
<div n="lb"/>is supported by the similar epithets, ‘having the mark of a lute on
<div n="lb"/>the ear’ ({%karkari-karṇyaḥ%}), ‘having the mark of a sickle on the ear’
<div n="lb"/>({%dātra-karṇyaḥ%}), ‘having the mark of a stake on the ear’ ({%sthūṇā-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%karṇyaḥ%}), ‘having the ears bored’ ({%chidra-karṇyaḥ%}), and {%viṣtya-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%karṇyaḥ,%} given in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā.<sup>5</sup> The simple mean-
<div n="lb"/>ing, ‘with marked ears,’ is, however, supported by the same
<div n="lb"/>passage of the Maitrāyaṇī, where the verb {%akṣ%} occurs in the
<div n="lb"/>sense ‘to mark.’ In the Atharvaveda the mark used is the
<div n="lb"/>Mithuna, no doubt as a magical device to secure fertility.
<div n="P"/>The marking of ears was apparently a regular practice. It is
<div n="lb"/>twice referred to in the Atharvaveda.<sup>6</sup> The mark is termed
<div n="lb"/>{%lakṣman,%}<sup>7</sup> and was made with a copper-knife<sup>8</sup> ({%lohita%}). The
<div n="lb"/>Maitrayaṇī Saṃhitā<sup>9</sup> forbids the use of an arrow-shaft ({%tejana%}),
<div n="lb"/>or of iron, but permits that of a stem of sugar-cane ({%ikṣu-kāṇḍa%})
<div n="lb"/>or copper.

{@Ahan,@}¦ ‘day.’ Like other peoples, the Indians used night
<div n="lb"/>as a general expression of time as well as day, but by no means
<div n="lb"/>predominantly.<sup>1</sup> Night is also termed the dark ({%kṛṣṇa%}), as
[Page1-049+ 56]
<div n="lb"/>opposed to the light ({%arjuna%}), day.<sup>2</sup> Aho-rātra<sup>3</sup> is a regular
<div n="lb"/>term for ‘day and night’ combined.
<div n="P"/>The day itself is variously divided. In the Atharvaveda<sup>4</sup>
<div n="lb"/>a division into ‘the rising sun’ ({%udyan sūryaḥ%}), ‘the coming
<div n="lb"/>together of the cows’ ({%saṃ-gava%}), ‘midday’ ({%madhyaṃ-dina%}),
<div n="lb"/>‘afternoon’ ({%aparāhṇa%}), and ‘sunset’ ({%astaṃ-yan%}) is found.
<div n="lb"/>In the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>5</sup> the same series appears with
<div n="lb"/>‘early’ ({%prātar%}) and ‘evening’ ({%sāyāhna%}) substituted for the
<div n="lb"/>first and last members, while a shorter list gives {%prātar,%}
<div n="lb"/>{%saṃgava, sāyam.%} In the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā<sup>6</sup> there is the
<div n="lb"/>series ‘dawn’ {%(uṣas), saṃgava, madhyaṃdina,%} and {%aparāhṇa.%}
<div n="P"/>The morning is also, according to Zimmer, called {%api-śarvara,%}<sup>7</sup>
<div n="lb"/>as the time when the dark is just past. It is named {%svasara,%}<sup>8</sup>
<div n="lb"/>as the time when the cows are feeding, before the first milking
<div n="lb"/>at the {%saṃgava,%} or when the birds are awakening.<sup>9</sup> It is also
<div n="lb"/>called {%pra-pitva,%}<sup>10</sup> according to Zimmer.<sup>11</sup> But Geldner<sup>12</sup> points
<div n="lb"/>out that that term refers to the late midday, which also is
<div n="lb"/>called {%api-śarvara,%} as bordering on the coming night, being the
<div n="lb"/>time when day is hastening to its close, as in a race. From
<div n="lb"/>another point of view, evening is called {%abhi-pitva,%}<sup>13</sup> the time
<div n="lb"/>when all come to rest. Or again, morning and evening are
<div n="lb"/>denoted as the dawning of the sun ({%uditā sūryasya%}), or its
<div n="lb"/>setting ({%ni-mruc%}). The midday is regularly {%madhyam ahnām,%}<sup>14</sup>
<div n="lb"/>{%madhye,%}<sup>15</sup> or {%madhyaṃdina. Saṃgava%}<sup>16</sup> is the forenoon, between
<div n="lb"/>the early morning ({%prātar%}) and midday ({%madhyaṃdina%}).
<div n="P"/>The divisions of time less than the day are seldom precisely
<div n="lb"/>given. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>17</sup> however, a day and
[Page1-050+ 48]
<div n="lb"/>night make up 30 {%muhūrtas;%} 1 {%muhūrta%} = 15 {%kṣipra;%} 1 {%kṣipra%} =
<div n="lb"/>15 {%etarhi;%} 1 {%etarhi%} = 15 {%idāni;%} 1 {%idāni%} = 15 breathings; 1 breath-
<div n="lb"/>ing = 1 spiration; 1 spiration = 1 twinkling ({%nimeṣa%}), etc. In
<div n="lb"/>the Sāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka<sup>18</sup> the series is {%dhvaṃsayo, nimeṣāḥ,%}
<div n="lb"/>{%kāṣṭhāḥ, kalāḥ, kṣanā, muhūrtā, ahorātrāḥ.%} A thirtyfold division
<div n="lb"/>of day as well as of night is seen in one passage of the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda<sup>19</sup> by Zimmer, who compares the Babylonian sixty-
<div n="lb"/>fold division of the day and night. But the expression used — 
<div n="lb"/>thirty Yojanas — is too vague and obscure — Bergaigne<sup>20</sup> refers
<div n="lb"/>it to the firmament — to build any theory upon with safety.
<div n="P"/>The longer divisions of time are regularly ‘half month’
<div n="lb"/>({%ardha-māsa%}), ‘month’ ({%māsa%}), ‘season’ ({%ṛtu%}), and ‘year’
<div n="lb"/>({%saṃvatsara%}), which often<sup>21</sup> occur in this sequence after
<div n="lb"/>{%ahorātrāṇi%} (‘days and nights’).

{@Āji@}¦ is constantly used in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and the later
<div n="lb"/>literature to express the sense of ‘a race,’ and only seldom
<div n="lb"/>denotes ‘a battle.’ {@Horse@}-racing was one of the favourite
<div n="lb"/>amusements of the {@Vedic@} Indian,<sup>2</sup> the other being dicing
[Page1-054+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>({@Akṣa@}). The racecourse, called Kāṣṭhā<sup>3</sup> or Āji<sup>4</sup> itself, appears
<div n="lb"/>from the Atharvaveda<sup>5</sup> to have been a quasi-circular one to
<div n="lb"/>a mark ({%kārṣman%}<sup>6</sup> ) and back again. In the Rigveda the
<div n="lb"/>course is described as broad ({%urvī%}) and the distance as
<div n="lb"/>measured out ({%apāvṛktā aratnayaḥ%}).<sup>7</sup> Prizes ({%dhana%}) were
<div n="lb"/>offered ({%dhā%}),<sup>8</sup> and eagerly competed for. Other words for
<div n="lb"/>victory and the prize are {%kāra%}<sup>9</sup> and {%bhara;%}<sup>10</sup> and to ‘run a
<div n="lb"/>race’ is described by the expressions {%ājim aj, i, dhāv, sṛ.%}<sup>11</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The person who instituted a race is referred to as {%āji-sṛt,%}<sup>12</sup> and
<div n="lb"/>Indra is called {%āji-kṛt%}<sup>13</sup> (‘race-maker’), and {%āji-pati%}<sup>14</sup> (‘lord
<div n="lb"/>of the race’).
<div n="P"/>The swift steeds ({%vājin, atya%}) used for the races were often
<div n="lb"/>washed and adorned.<sup>15</sup> According to Pischel<sup>16</sup> the name of
<div n="lb"/>one swift mare is preserved — viz., Viśpalā,<sup>17</sup> whose broken leg
<div n="lb"/>was replaced by the Aśvins in a race; but the interpretation
<div n="lb"/>is very doubtful. Geldner<sup>18</sup> has also found a comic picture of
<div n="lb"/>a horse-chariot race in the Mudgala hymn in the Rigveda,
<div n="lb"/>but Bloomfield<sup>19</sup> has shown that that interpretation is un-
<div n="lb"/>sound. Pischel<sup>20</sup> also seeks to show that races were run in
<div n="lb"/>honour of gods, but the evidence for the theory is inadequate.<sup>21</sup>

{@Ā-yudha,@}¦ ‘weapon,’ in its widest sense covers the whole
<div n="lb"/>of a Kṣatriya's warlike equipment, which in the Aitareya
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> is summed up as horse-chariot ({%aśva-ratha%}), bow
<div n="lb"/>and arrows ({%iṣu-dhanva%}), and corselet ({%kavaca%}). As the bow and
<div n="lb"/>arrow ({%iṣu, dhanvan%}) were essential as the main weapons of
<div n="lb"/>the Vedic fighter, they are probably meant when Āyudha is
<div n="lb"/>used specifically of weapons, as often from the Rigveda<sup>2</sup>
<div n="lb"/>onwards. The battle hymn in the Rigveda<sup>3</sup> confirms this
<div n="lb"/>view, as it presents to us the warrior armed with bow and
<div n="lb"/>arrow on his chariot, and clad in armour ({@Varman@}), with a
<div n="lb"/>guard ({@Hastaghna@}) on the left arm to avoid the friction of the
<div n="lb"/>bow-string. The corselet was not a single solid piece of metal,
<div n="lb"/>but consisted of many pieces fitted together ({%syūta%});<sup>4</sup> it may
[Page1-061+ 41]
<div n="lb"/>have been made either of metal plates or, as is more likely, of
<div n="lb"/>some stiff material plated with metal. In addition the warrior
<div n="lb"/>wore a helmet ({@Śiprā@}). There is no trace of the use of a
<div n="lb"/>shield, nor is there any clear record of the employment of
<div n="lb"/>greaves or other guard for the feet.<sup>5</sup> Skill in the use of weapons
<div n="lb"/>is referred to in the Rigveda.<sup>6</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is doubtful whether sling stones ({@Adri, Aśani@}) were in

<L>265<pc>1-064<k1>Arya<k2>Arya
{@Ārya@}¦ is the normal designation in the Vedic literature from
<div n="lb"/>the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> onwards of an Āryan, a member of the three
<div n="lb"/>upper classes, {@Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya,@} or {@Vaiśya,@} as the formal
<div n="lb"/>division is given in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>2</sup> The Ārya
<div n="lb"/>stands in opposition to the {@Dāsa,@}<sup>3</sup> but also to the {@Śūdra.@}
<div n="lb"/>Sometimes<sup>4</sup> the expression is restricted to the Vaiśya caste,
[Page1-065+ 56]
<div n="lb"/>the Brāhmaṇa and the Kṣatriya receiving special designations;
<div n="lb"/>but this use is not common, and it is often uncertain also
<div n="lb"/>whether {@Arya@} is not meant. The phrase Śūdrāryau<sup>5</sup> is espe-
<div n="lb"/>cially ambiguous, but appears to have denoted originally the
<div n="lb"/>Śūdra and the Āryan, for in the Mahāvrata ceremony the fight
<div n="lb"/>between a Śūdra and an Ārya is represented in the Taittirīya
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa as one between a Brāhmaṇa and a Śūdra, though
<div n="lb"/>the Sūtra treats it as a fight between a Vaiśya and a Śūdra.
<div n="P"/>The word Ārya (fem. Āryā or Ārī) also occurs frequently
<div n="lb"/>used as an adjective to describe the Āryan classes ({%viśaḥ%}),<sup>6</sup> or
<div n="lb"/>name ({%nāman%}),<sup>7</sup> or caste ({%varṇa%}),<sup>8</sup> or dwellings ({%dhāman%});<sup>9</sup> or
<div n="lb"/>again reference is made to the Āryan supremacy ({%vrata%})<sup>10</sup> being
<div n="lb"/>extended over the land. Āryan foes ({%vṛtra%})<sup>11</sup> are referred to
<div n="lb"/>beside Dāsa foes, and there are many<sup>12</sup> references to war
<div n="lb"/>of Āryan versus Āryan, as well as to war of Āryan against
<div n="lb"/>Dāsa. From this it can be fairly deduced that even by the
<div n="lb"/>time of the Rigveda the Āryan communities had advanced
<div n="lb"/>far beyond the stage of simple conquest of the aborigines. In
<div n="lb"/>the later Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas the wars alluded to seem
<div n="lb"/>mainly Āryan wars, no doubt in consequence of the fusion of
<div n="lb"/>Ārya and Dāsa into one community.
<div n="P"/>Weber<sup>13</sup> considers that the five peoples known to the Rigveda
<div n="lb"/>were the Āryans and the four peoples of the quarters ({%diś%})
<div n="lb"/>of the earth, but this is doubtful. Āryan speech ({%vāc%})<sup>14</sup>

<div n="lb"/>whom, as a reward for study, the procreation of children, the
<div n="lb"/>practice of Yoga, abstention from injury to living creatures,
<div n="lb"/>and sacrifices, freedom from transmigration are promised. In
<div n="lb"/>another place<sup>3</sup> three states are contemplated, but not as con-
<div n="lb"/>secutive. The Brahmacārin may either become a householder
<div n="lb"/>or become an anchorite, or remain in his teacher's house all his
<div n="lb"/>life. Similarly, reference<sup>4</sup> is made to the death of the anchorite
<div n="lb"/>in the forest, or the sacrifice in the village. In contrast with all
<div n="lb"/>three<sup>5</sup> is the man who stands fast in Brahman (Brahma-
<div n="lb"/>saṃstha). In the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad<sup>6</sup> the knower of the

<div n="lb"/>wood. In another passage of the Atharvaveda<sup>7</sup> Lanman
<div n="lb"/>seems to take the seat meant as a ‘long reclining chair.’ There
<div n="lb"/>also a cushion ({@Upadhāna@}) and coverlet ({@Upavāsana@}) are

{@Itihāsa,@}¦ as a kind of literature, is repeatedly mentioned
<div n="lb"/>along with {@Purāṇa@} in the later texts of the Vedic period.
<div n="lb"/>The earliest reference to both occurs in the late fifteenth book
<div n="lb"/>of the Atharvaveda.<sup>1</sup> Itihāsa then appears in the Śatapatha
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa,<sup>2</sup> the Jaiminīya,<sup>3</sup> Bṛhadāraṇyaka,<sup>4</sup> and Chāndogya
<div n="lb"/>Upaniṣads.<sup>5</sup> In the latter it is expressly declared with Purāṇa
<div n="lb"/>to make up the fifth Veda, while the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra<sup>6</sup>
<div n="lb"/>makes the Itihāsa a Veda and the Purāṇa a Veda. The
<div n="lb"/>Itihāsa-veda and the Purāṇa-veda appear also in the Gopatha
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa,<sup>7</sup> while the Śatapatha<sup>8</sup> identifies the Itihāsa as well
<div n="lb"/>as the Purāṇa with the Veda. In one passage {@Anvākhyāna@}
<div n="lb"/>and Itihāsa are distinguished<sup>9</sup> as different classes of works, but
<div n="lb"/>the exact point of distinction is obscure; probably the former
<div n="lb"/>was supplementary. The Taittirīya Āraṇyaka<sup>10</sup> mentions
<div n="lb"/>Itihāsas and Purāṇas in the plural.
<div n="P"/>There is nothing to show in the older literature what dis-
<div n="lb"/>tinction there was, if any, between Itihāsa and Purāṇa; and
<div n="lb"/>the late literature,<sup>11</sup> which has been elaborately examined by
<div n="lb"/>Sieg,<sup>12</sup> yields no consistent result. Geldner<sup>13</sup> has conjectured
<div n="lb"/>that there existed a single work, the Itihāsa-purāṇa, a collection
[Page1-077+ 51]
<div n="lb"/>of the old legends of all sorts, heroic, cosmogonic, genealogical;
<div n="lb"/>but though a work called Itihāsa, and another called Purāṇa,
<div n="lb"/>were probably known to Patañjali,<sup>14</sup> the inaccuracy of Geldner's
<div n="lb"/>view is proved by the fact that Yāska shows no sign of having
<div n="lb"/>known any such work. To him the Itihāsa may be a part of
<div n="lb"/>the Mantra literature itself,<sup>15</sup> Aitihāsikas being merely people
<div n="lb"/>who interpret the Rigveda by seeing in it legends where others
<div n="lb"/>see myths.<sup>16</sup> The fact, however, that the use of the compound
<div n="lb"/>form is rare, and that Yāska regularly has Itihāsa,<sup>17</sup> not
<div n="lb"/>Itihāsa-purāṇa, is against the theory of there ever having been
<div n="lb"/>one work.
<div n="P"/>The relation of Itihāsa to {@Ākhyāna@} is also uncertain. Sieg<sup>18</sup>
<div n="lb"/>considers that the words Itihāsa and Purāṇa referred to the
<div n="lb"/>great body of mythology, legendary history, and cosmogonic
<div n="lb"/>legend available to the Vedic poets, and roughly classed as a
<div n="lb"/>fifth Veda, though not definitely and finally fixed. Thus,
<div n="lb"/>Anvākhyānas, {@Anuvyākhyānas,@} and {@Vyākhyānas@} could arise,
<div n="lb"/>and separate Ākhyānas could still exist outside the cycle,
<div n="lb"/>while an Ākhyāna could also be a part of the Itihāsa-purāṇa.
<div n="lb"/>He also suggests that the word Ākhyāna has special reference
<div n="lb"/>to the form of the narrative. Oldenberg,<sup>19</sup> following Windisch,<sup>20</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and followed by Geldner,<sup>21</sup> Sieg, and others, has found in the
<div n="lb"/>Ākhyāna form a mixture of prose and verse, alternating as
<div n="lb"/>the narrative was concerned with the mere accessory parts of
<div n="lb"/>the tale, or with the chief points, at which the poetic form
<div n="lb"/>was naturally produced to correspond with the stress of the
<div n="lb"/>emotion. This theory has been severely criticized by Hertel<sup>22</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and von Schroeder.<sup>23</sup> These scholars, in accordance with
<div n="lb"/>older suggestions of Max Müller<sup>24</sup> and Lévi,<sup>25</sup> see in the
[Page1-078+ 34]
<div n="lb"/>so-called Ākhyāna hymns of the Rigveda, in which Oldenberg
<div n="lb"/>finds actual specimens of the supposed literary genus, though
<div n="lb"/>the prose has been lost, actual remains of ritual dramas.
<div n="lb"/>Elsewhere<sup>26</sup> it has been suggested that the hymns in question
<div n="lb"/>are merely literary dialogues.

1. {@Ibha@}¦ is a word of somewhat doubtful sense and inter-
<div n="lb"/>pretation. It is found only in the Saṃhitās,<sup>1</sup> and especially in
<div n="lb"/>the Rigveda.<sup>2</sup> According to Roth<sup>3</sup> and Ludwig<sup>4</sup> the sense is
<div n="lb"/>‘retainer,’ and Zimmer<sup>5</sup> thinks that it includes not only
<div n="lb"/>dependants and servants, but also the royal family and the
<div n="lb"/>youthful cadets of the chief families. In the opinion of Pischel
<div n="lb"/>and Geldner<sup>6</sup> it denotes ‘elephant.’ This view is supported
<div n="lb"/>by the authority of the commentators Sāyaṇa<sup>7</sup> and Mahīdhara;<sup>8</sup>
<div n="lb"/>the Nirukta,<sup>9</sup> too, gives ‘elephant’ as one of the senses of the
<div n="lb"/>word. Megasthenes<sup>10</sup> and Nearchos<sup>11</sup> tell us that elephants
<div n="lb"/>were a royal prerogative, and the derivative word {@Ibhya@} may
<div n="lb"/>thus be naturally explained as denoting merely ‘rich’ (lit.,
<div n="lb"/>‘possessor of elephants’).<sup>12</sup>

{@Iriṇa@}¦ (neut.) occurs not rarely in the later Saṃhitās<sup>1</sup> and

<div n="lb"/>natural ({%sva-kṛta%}). The same meaning is also, as Pischel<sup>3</sup>

<div n="lb"/>({%apā kṛtam%}). In another passage of the Rigveda<sup>6</sup> the word

<div n="lb"/>Pischel<sup>7</sup> concludes that the dicing-board must have been
<div n="lb"/>so called because it contained holes into which the dice had
<div n="lb"/>to be thrown if possible. Lüders,<sup>8</sup> however, points out that
<div n="lb"/>this assumption is not necessary; the dice ({@Akṣa@}) were merely
<div n="lb"/>thrown on a space dug out, which could be called {@Iriṇa,@} as

{@Iṣu@}¦ is the usual name for ‘arrow’ from the Rigveda<sup>1</sup>

<div n="lb"/>hymn of the Rigveda,<sup>2</sup> which gives a catalogue of armour,
<div n="lb"/>two kinds of arrows are distinctly referred to: the one is
<div n="lb"/>poisoned ({%ālāktā%}), and has a head of horn ({%ruru-śīrṣṇī%}); the
<div n="lb"/>other is copper-, bronze-, or iron-headed ({%ayo-mukham%}). Poisoned
<div n="lb"/>({%digdhā%}) arrows are also referred to in the Atharvaveda.<sup>3</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>arrows were feathered.<sup>4</sup> The parts of an arrow are enumerated
<div n="lb"/>in the Atharvaveda<sup>5</sup> as the shaft ({%śalya%}), the feather-socket
<div n="lb"/>({%parṇa-dhi%}), the point ({%śṛṅga%}), the neck of the point in which
<div n="lb"/>the shaft is fixed ({%kulmala%}), and the {@Apaskambha@} and {@Apāṣṭha,@}
<div n="lb"/>which are of more doubtful significance. In the Aitareya

{@Uddālaka Āruṇi.@}¦ — Uddālaka, son of Aruṇa, is one of the
<div n="lb"/>most prominent teachers of the Vedic period. He was a Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa of the Kurupañcālas, according to the Śatapatha Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa.<sup>1</sup> This statement is confirmed by the fact that he was
<div n="lb"/>teacher of {@Proti Kausurubindi@} of Kauśāmbī,<sup>2</sup> and that his son
[Page1-088+ 60]
<div n="lb"/>{@Svetaketu@} is found disputing among the Pañcālas.<sup>3</sup> He was a
<div n="lb"/>pupil of Aruṇa, his father,<sup>4</sup> as well as of Patañcala Kāpya,<sup>5</sup> of
<div n="lb"/>Madra, while he was the teacher of the famous Yājñavalkya<sup>6</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Vājasaneya and of Kauṣītaki,<sup>7</sup> although the former is represented
<div n="lb"/>elsewhere<sup>8</sup> as having silenced him. He overcame in argument
<div n="lb"/>Prācīnayogya Śauceya,<sup>9</sup> and apparently also Bhadrasena Ājāta-
<div n="lb"/>śatrava,<sup>10</sup> though the text here seems to read the name as
<div n="lb"/>Āraṇi. He was a Gautama,<sup>11</sup> and is often alluded to as such.
<div n="lb"/>As an authority on questions of ritual and philosophy, he is
<div n="lb"/>repeatedly referred to by his patronymic name Āruṇi in the
<div n="lb"/>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>12</sup> the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad,<sup>13</sup> the

<div n="lb"/>Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad.<sup>18</sup> In the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā he is not
<div n="lb"/>mentioned, according to Geldner,<sup>19</sup> but only his father Aruṇa;
<div n="lb"/>his name does not occur, according to Weber,<sup>20</sup> in the Pañca-
<div n="lb"/>viṃśa Brāhmaṇa, but in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>21</sup> he is, as
<div n="lb"/>Āruṇi, known as a contemporary of {@Divodāsa Bhaimaseni,@} and
<div n="lb"/>in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa<sup>22</sup> he is mentioned as
<div n="lb"/>serving {@Vāsiṣṭha Caikitāneya.@} In the Taittirīya tradition he
<div n="lb"/>seldom appears. There is an allusion in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>23</sup>
<div n="lb"/>to Kusurubinda Auddālaki, and according to the Taittirīya
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa,<sup>24</sup> Naciketas was a son of Vājaśravasa Gautama, who
[Page1-089+ 47]
<div n="lb"/>is made out to be Uddālaka by Sāyaṇa.<sup>25</sup> But the episode of
<div n="lb"/>Naciketas, being somewhat unreal, cannot be regarded as of
<div n="lb"/>historical value in proving relationship. Aruṇa is known to the
<div n="lb"/>Taittirīya Saṃhitā. A real son of Uddālaka was the famous
<div n="lb"/>{@Śvetaketu,@} who is expressly reported by Āpastamba<sup>26</sup> to have

{@Upa-niṣad@}¦ in the Brāhmaṇas<sup>1</sup> normally denotes the ‘secret
<div n="lb"/>sense’ of some word or text, sometimes the ‘secret rule’ of the
<div n="lb"/>mendicant. But in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad<sup>2</sup> it is already
<div n="lb"/>used in the plural as the designation of a class of writings, no
<div n="lb"/>doubt actually existing and similar to the Upaniṣads in the
<div n="lb"/>nature of their subject-matter and its treatment. Similarly
<div n="lb"/>the sections of the Taittirīya Upaniṣad end with the words
<div n="lb"/>{%ity upaniṣad.%} The Aitareya Āraṇyaka<sup>3</sup> commences its third
<div n="lb"/>part with the title ‘The Upaniṣad of the Saṃhitā,’ and the
<div n="lb"/>title occurs also in the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka.<sup>4</sup> The exact
<div n="lb"/>primary sense of the expression is doubtful. The natural
<div n="lb"/>derivation, adopted by Max Müller<sup>5</sup> and usual ever since,
<div n="lb"/>makes the word mean firstly a session of pupils, hence secret
<div n="lb"/>doctrine, and secondly the title of a work on secret doctrine.
<div n="lb"/>Oldenberg,<sup>6</sup> however, traces the use of the word to the earlier
[Page1-092+ 42]
<div n="lb"/>sense of ‘worship’ ({%cf. upāsana%}). Deussen<sup>7</sup> considers the
<div n="lb"/>original sense to have been ‘secret word,’ next ‘secret text,’
<div n="lb"/>and then ‘secret import,’ but this order of meaning is im-
<div n="lb"/>probable. Hopkins<sup>8</sup> suggests that Upaniṣad denotes a sub-
<div n="lb"/>sidiary treatise, but this sense does not account naturally for
<div n="lb"/>the common use as ‘secret meaning,’ which is far more
<div n="lb"/>frequent than any other.

<L>377<pc>1-096<k1>upasti<k2>upasti
{@Upa-sti@}¦ denotes both in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and the Atharvaveda<sup>2</sup> a
<div n="lb"/>‘dependent,’ just as later in the Epic<sup>3</sup> the subordination of the
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśya to the two superior castes is expressed by the verb
<div n="lb"/>{%upa-sthā,%} ‘stand under,’ ‘support.’ The word also appears,
<div n="lb"/>with the same sense, in the form of Sti, but only in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda.<sup>4</sup> The exact nature of the dependence connoted by
<div n="lb"/>the term is quite uncertain. Zimmer<sup>5</sup> conjectures that the
<div n="lb"/>‘dependents’ were the members of defeated Aryan tribes who
<div n="lb"/>became clients of the king, as among the Greeks, Romans, and
<div n="lb"/>Germans, the term possibly including persons who had lost
<div n="lb"/>their freedom through dicing.<sup>6</sup> The evidence of the Athar-
<div n="lb"/>vaveda<sup>7</sup> shows that among the Upastis were included the
<div n="lb"/>chariot-makers ({%ratha-kāra%}), the smiths ({%takṣan%}), and the
<div n="lb"/>charioteers ({%sūta%}), and troop-leaders ({%grāma-ṇī%}), while the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda passages negative the possibility of the ‘subjects’ ({%sti%})
<div n="lb"/>being the whole people. It is therefore fair to assume that
<div n="lb"/>they were the clients proper of the king, not servile, but
<div n="lb"/>attached in a special relation to him as opposed to the ordinary
<div n="lb"/>population. They may well have included among them not
<div n="lb"/>only the classes suggested by Zimmer, but also higher elements,
<div n="lb"/>such as refugees from other clans, as well as ambitious men
<div n="lb"/>who sought advancement in the royal service. Indeed, the
<div n="lb"/>Sūta and the Grāmaṇī were, as such, officers of the king's house-
<div n="lb"/>hold — kingmakers, not themselves kings, as they are described
<div n="lb"/>in the Atharvaveda.<sup>8</sup> The use of the word in the Taittirīya
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitā,<sup>9</sup> the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>10</sup> and the Kāṭhaka,<sup>11</sup> is
<div n="lb"/>purely metaphorical, as well as in the one passage of the

<div n="lb"/>the Atharvaveda,<sup>12</sup> Vaiśya, Śūdra, and Ārya are referred to as
<div n="lb"/>Upastis, perhaps in the general sense of ‘subject.’

<div n="lb"/>the ass, etc., from the goat, the sheep, and cattle. The

<div n="lb"/>In one passage of the Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>4</sup> man is classed with

<div n="lb"/>the eight incisors of which are, in fact, limited to the lower jaw.
<div n="lb"/>The ass is styled {%ubhayā-dant%} in the Atharvaveda.<sup>6</sup> In one
<div n="lb"/>passage of the Atharvaveda,<sup>7</sup> however, the epithet is applied to
<div n="lb"/>a ram; but the sense here is that a marvel occurs, just as in
<div n="lb"/>the Rigveda<sup>8</sup> a ram destroys a lioness. Bloomfield<sup>9</sup> suggests
<div n="lb"/>in the Atharvaveda passage another reading which would mean
<div n="lb"/>‘horse.’ A parallel division of animals is that of the Taittirīya<sup>10</sup>

{@Urvarā@}¦ is with {@Kṣetra@} the regular expression, from the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda<sup>1</sup> onwards, denoting a piece of ‘ploughland’ (<lang n="greek"></lang>).
<div n="lb"/>Fertile ({%apnasvatī%}) fields<sup>2</sup> are spoken of as well as waste fields
<div n="lb"/>({%ārtanā%}).<sup>3</sup> Intensive cultivation by means of irrigation is
<div n="lb"/>clearly referred to both in the Rigveda<sup>4</sup> and in the Atharva-
<div n="lb"/>veda,<sup>5</sup> while allusion is also made to the use of manure.<sup>6</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>fields ({%kṣetra%}) were carefully measured according to the Rigveda.<sup>7</sup>
<div n="lb"/>This fact points clearly to individual ownership in land for the
<div n="lb"/>plough, a conclusion supported by the reference of Apālā, in
<div n="lb"/>a hymn of the Rigveda,<sup>8</sup> to her father's field ({%urvarā%}), which
<div n="lb"/>is put on the same level as his head of hair as a personal
<div n="lb"/>possession. Consistent with this are the epithets ‘winning
<div n="lb"/>fields’ ({%urvarā-sā, urvarā-jit, kṣetra-sā%}),<sup>9</sup> while ‘lord of fields’
<div n="lb"/>used of a god<sup>10</sup> is presumably a transfer of a human epithet
<div n="lb"/>({%urvarā-pati%}). Moreover, fields are spoken of in the same
[Page1-100+ 66]
<div n="lb"/>connexion as children,<sup>11</sup> and the conquest of fields ({%kṣetrāṇi%}
<div n="lb"/>{%saṃ-ji%}) is often referred to in the Saṃhitās.<sup>12</sup> Very probably, as
<div n="lb"/>suggested by Pischel,<sup>13</sup> the ploughland was bounded by grass
<div n="lb"/>land (perhaps denoted by {@Khila, Khilya@}) which in all likelihood
<div n="lb"/>would be joint property on the analogy of property elsewhere.
<div n="lb"/>There is no trace in Vedic literature of communal property
<div n="lb"/>in the sense of ownership by a community of any sort,<sup>14</sup> nor is
<div n="lb"/>there mention of communal cultivation. Individual property
<div n="lb"/>in land seems also presumed later on. In the Chāndogya
<div n="lb"/>Upaniṣad<sup>15</sup> the things given as examples of wealth include
<div n="lb"/>fields and houses ({%āyatanāni%}). The Greek evidence<sup>16</sup> also
<div n="lb"/>points to individual ownership. The precise nature of the
<div n="lb"/>ownership is of course not determined by the expression
<div n="lb"/>‘individual ownership.’ The legal relationship of the head
<div n="lb"/>of a family and its members is nowhere explained, and can
<div n="lb"/>only be conjectured (see {@Pitṛ@}). Very often a family may have
<div n="lb"/>lived together with undivided shares in the land. The rules
<div n="lb"/>about the inheritance of landed property do not occur before the
<div n="lb"/>Sūtras.<sup>17</sup> In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>18</sup> the giving of land as
<div n="lb"/>a fee to priests is mentioned, but with reproof: land was no
<div n="lb"/>doubt even then a very special kind of property, not lightly to
<div n="lb"/>be given away or parted with.<sup>19</sup>

{@Uśīnara@}¦ — In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇā<sup>1</sup> the Kuru-Pañcālas are
<div n="lb"/>mentioned as dwelling together in the ‘Middle Country’ with
<div n="lb"/>the Vaśas and the Uśīnaras. In the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad<sup>2</sup> also
<div n="lb"/>the Uśīnaras are associated with the Kuru-Pañcālas and Vaśas,
<div n="lb"/>but in the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup> the Uśīnaras and Vaśas are re-
<div n="lb"/>garded as northerners. In the Rigveda<sup>4</sup> the people is alluded to
<div n="lb"/>in one passage by reference to their queen, Uśīnarāṇī. Zimmer<sup>5</sup>
<div n="lb"/>thinks that the Uśīnaras earlier lived farther to the north-west,
<div n="lb"/>but for this there is no clear evidence. His theory is based
<div n="lb"/>merely on the fact that the Anukramaṇī (Index) of the Rigveda
<div n="lb"/>ascribes one hymn<sup>6</sup> to Śibi Auśīnara, and that the Śibis were
<div n="lb"/>known to Alexander's followers as <lang n="greek"></lang>,<sup>7</sup> living between the
<div n="lb"/>Indus and the Akesines (Chenab). But this is in no way
<div n="lb"/>conclusive, as the Śibis, at any rate in Epic times,<sup>8</sup> occupied
<div n="lb"/>the land to the north of Kurukṣetra, and there is no reason
<div n="lb"/>whatever to show that in the Vedic period the Uśīnaras were
<div n="lb"/>farther west than the ‘Middle Country.’

{@Ṛṇa,@}¦ ‘debt,’ is repeatedly mentioned from the Rigveda<sup>1</sup>
<div n="lb"/>onwards, having apparently been a normal condition among
<div n="lb"/>the Vedic Indians. Reference is often made<sup>2</sup> to debts con-
<div n="lb"/>tracted at dicing. To pay off a debt was called {%ṛṇaṃ saṃ-nī.%}<sup>3</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Allusion is made to debt contracted without intention of
<div n="lb"/>payment.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>The result of non-payment of a debt might be very serious:
<div n="lb"/>the dicer might fall into slavery.<sup>5</sup> Debtors, like other male-
<div n="lb"/>factors, such as thieves, were frequently bound by their
<div n="lb"/>creditors to posts ({%dru-pada%}),<sup>6</sup> presumably as a means of
<div n="lb"/>putting pressure on them or their friends to pay up the
<div n="lb"/>debt.
<div n="P"/>The amount of interest payable is impossible to make out.
<div n="lb"/>In one passage of the Rigveda and Atharvaveda<sup>7</sup> an eighth
<div n="lb"/>({%śapha%}) and a sixteenth ({%kalā%}) are mentioned as paid, but it is
<div n="lb"/>quite uncertain whether interest or an instalment of the
<div n="lb"/>principal is meant. Presumably the interest would be paid
<div n="lb"/>in kind.
<div n="P"/>How far a debt was a heritable interest or obligation does
<div n="lb"/>not appear. The Kauśika Sūtra<sup>8</sup> regards three hymns of the
[Page1-110+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>Atharvaveda<sup>9</sup> as applicable to the occasion of the payment of
<div n="lb"/>a debt after the creditor's decease. For the payment of a debt.
<div n="lb"/>by a relation of the debtor the evidence is still less clear.<sup>10</sup>
<div n="P"/>Zimmer<sup>11</sup> thinks that payments of debt were made in the
<div n="lb"/>presence of witnesses who could be appealed to in case of
<div n="lb"/>dispute. This conclusion is, however, very uncertain, resting
<div n="lb"/>solely on a vague verse in the Atharvaveda.<sup>12</sup>

<div n="lb"/>to debt, and if this is the meaning the

{@Ṛtu,@}¦ ‘season,’ is a term repeatedly mentioned from the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda<sup>1</sup> onwards, Three seasons of the year are often
<div n="lb"/>alluded to,<sup>2</sup> but the names are not usually specified. In one
<div n="lb"/>passage of the Rigveda<sup>3</sup> spring ({%vasanta%}), summer ({%grīṣma%}), and
<div n="lb"/>autumn ({%śarad%}) are given. The Rigveda knows also the rainy
<div n="lb"/>season ({%prā-vṛṣ%}) and the winter ({%himā, hemanta%}). A more
<div n="lb"/>usual<sup>4</sup> division (not found in the Rigveda) is into five seasons,
[Page1-111+ 57]
<div n="lb"/>{%vasanta, grīṣma, varṣā, śarad, hemama-siśira,%} but occasionally
<div n="lb"/>the five are otherwise divided, {%varṣā-śarad%} being made one
<div n="lb"/>season.<sup>5</sup> Sometimes six<sup>6</sup> seasons are reckoned, {%hemanta%} and
<div n="lb"/>{%śiśira%} being divided, so that the six seasons can be made
<div n="lb"/>parallel to the twelve months of the year. A still more
<div n="lb"/>artificial arrangement<sup>7</sup> makes the seasons seven, possibly by
<div n="lb"/>reckoning the intercalary month as a season, as Weber and
<div n="lb"/>Zimmer<sup>8</sup> hold, or more probably because of the predilection
<div n="lb"/>for the number seven, as Roth<sup>9</sup> suggests. Occasionally the
<div n="lb"/>word {%ṛtu%} is applied to the months.<sup>10</sup> The last season,
<div n="lb"/>according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>11</sup> is {%hemanta.%}
<div n="P"/>The growth of the division of the seasons from three to five
<div n="lb"/>is rightly explained by Zimmer<sup>12</sup> as indicating the advance of
<div n="lb"/>the Vedic Indians towards the east. It is not Rigvedic, but
<div n="lb"/>dominates the later Saṃhitās. Traces of an earlier division of
<div n="lb"/>the year into winter and summer do not appear clearly in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda, where the appropriate words {%himā%} and {%samā%} are
<div n="lb"/>merely general appellations of the year, and where {%śarad%}<sup>13</sup> is
<div n="lb"/>commoner than either as a designation of the year, because it
<div n="lb"/>denotes the harvest, a time of overwhelming importance to a
<div n="lb"/>young agricultural people. The division of the year in one
<div n="lb"/>passage of the Atharvaveda<sup>14</sup> into two periods of six months
<div n="lb"/>is merely formal, and in no way an indication of old
<div n="lb"/>tradition.

<L>430<pc>1-112<k1>ftvij<k2>ftvij
{@Ṛtv-ij@}¦ is the regular term for ‘sacrificial priest,’ covering all
<div n="lb"/>the different kinds of priests employed at the sacrifice. It
<div n="lb"/>appears certain that all the priests were Brāhmaṇas.<sup>1</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>number of priests officiating at a sacrifice with different functions
<div n="lb"/>was almost certainly seven. The oldest list, occurring in one
<div n="lb"/>passage of the Rigveda,<sup>2</sup> enumerates their names as Hotṛ, Potṛ,
<div n="lb"/>Neṣṭṛ, Agnīdh, Praśāstṛ, Adhvaryu, Brahman, besides the
<div n="lb"/>institutor of the sacrifice. The number of seven probably
<div n="lb"/>explains the phrase ‘seven Hotṛs’ occurring so frequently in
<div n="lb"/>the Rigveda, and is most likely connected with that of the
<div n="lb"/>mythical ‘seven Ṛṣis.’ It may be compared with the eight of
<div n="lb"/>Iran.<sup>3</sup> The chief of the seven priests was the Hotṛ, who was
<div n="lb"/>the singer of the hymns, and in the early times their composer
<div n="lb"/>also. The Adhvaryu performed the practical work of the
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice, and accompanied his performance with muttered
<div n="lb"/>formulas of prayer and deprecation of evil. His chief assist-
<div n="lb"/>ance was derived from the Agnīdh, the two performing the
<div n="lb"/>smaller sacrifices without other help in practical matters. The
<div n="lb"/>Praśāstṛ, Upavaktṛ, or Maitrāvaruṇa, as he was variously
<div n="lb"/>called, appeared only in the greater sacrifices as giving in-
<div n="lb"/>structions to the Hotṛ, and as entrusted with certain litanies.
<div n="lb"/>The Potṛ, Neṣṭṛ, and Brahman belonged to the ritual of the
<div n="lb"/>Soma sacrifice, the latter being later styled Brāhmaṇāc-
<div n="lb"/>chaṃsin to distinguish him from the priest who in the later
[Page1-113+ 60]
<div n="lb"/>ritual acted as supervisor. Other priests referred to in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda<sup>4</sup> are the singers of Sāmans or chants, the Udgātṛ
<div n="lb"/>and his assistant the Prastotṛ, while the Pratihartṛ, another
<div n="lb"/>assistant, though not mentioned, may quite well have been
<div n="lb"/>known. Their functions undoubtedly represent a later stage
<div n="lb"/>of the ritual, the development of the elaborate series of
<div n="lb"/>sacrificial calls on the one hand, and on the other the use
<div n="lb"/>of long hymns addressed to the Soma plant. Other priests,
<div n="lb"/>such as the Achāvāka,<sup>5</sup> the Grāvastut, the Unnetṛ, and the
<div n="lb"/>Subrahmaṇya, were known later in the developed ritual of the
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇas, making in all sixteen priests, who were technically
<div n="lb"/>and artificially classed in four groups<sup>6</sup> Hotṛ, Maitrāvaruṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Achāvāka, and Grāvastut; Udgātṛ, Prastotṛ, Pratihartṛ, and
<div n="lb"/>Subrahmaṇya; Adhvaryu, Pratisthātṛ, Neṣṭṛ, and Unnetṛ;
<div n="lb"/>Brahman, Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin, Agnīdhra, and Petṛ.
<div n="P"/>Apart from all these priests was the {@Purohita,@} who was
<div n="lb"/>the spiritual adviser of the king in all his religious duties.
<div n="lb"/>Geldner<sup>7</sup> holds that, as a rule, when the Purohita actually
<div n="lb"/>took part in one of the great sacrifices he played the part of
<div n="lb"/>the Brahman, in the sense of the priest who superintended the
<div n="lb"/>whole conduct of the ritual. He sees evidence for this view in
<div n="lb"/>a considerable number of passages of the Rigveda<sup>8</sup> and the
<div n="lb"/>later literature,<sup>9</sup> where Purohita and Brahman were combined
<div n="lb"/>or identified. Oldenberg,<sup>10</sup> however, more correctly points out
[Page1-114+ 49]
<div n="lb"/>that in the earlier period this was not the case: the Purohita
<div n="lb"/>was then normally the Hotṛ, the singer of the most important
<div n="lb"/>of the songs; it was only later that the Brahman, who in the
<div n="lb"/>capacity of overseer of the rite is not known to the Rigveda,
<div n="lb"/>acquired the function of general supervision hitherto exercised
<div n="lb"/>by the Purohita, who was {%ex officio%} skilled in the use of magic
<div n="lb"/>and in guarding the king by spells which could also be applied
<div n="lb"/>to guarding the sacrifice from evil demons. With this agrees
<div n="lb"/>the fact that Agni, pre-eminently<sup>11</sup> the Purohita of men, is also
<div n="lb"/>a Hotṛ, and that the two divine Hotṛs of the Āprī hymns are
<div n="lb"/>called<sup>12</sup> the divine Purohitas. On the other hand, the rule
<div n="lb"/>is explicitly recognized in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>13</sup> that a
<div n="lb"/>Kṣatriya should have a Brahman as a Purohita; and in
<div n="lb"/>the Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>14</sup> the Vasiṣṭha family have a special
<div n="lb"/>claim to the office of Brahman-Purohita, perhaps an indi-
<div n="lb"/>cation that it was they who first as Purohitas exchanged the
<div n="lb"/>function of Hotṛs for that of Brahmans in the sacrificial
<div n="lb"/>ritual.
<div n="P"/>The sacrifices were performed for an individual in the great
<div n="lb"/>majority of cases. The Sattra,<sup>15</sup> or prolonged sacrificial session,
<div n="lb"/>was, however, performed for the common benefit of the priests
<div n="lb"/>taking part in it, though its advantageous results could only be
<div n="lb"/>secured if all the members actually engaged were consecrated
<div n="lb"/>({%dīkṣita%}). Sacrifices for a people as such were unknown. The
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice for the king was, it is true, intended to bring about
<div n="lb"/>the prosperity of his people also; but it is characteristic that
<div n="lb"/>the prayer<sup>16</sup> for welfare includes by name only the priest and
<div n="lb"/>the king, referring to the people indirectly in connexion with
<div n="lb"/>the prosperity of their cattle and agriculture.
<F>1) This is assumed throughout the
<div n="lb"/>Vedic texts, and is accompanied by
<div n="lb"/>the rule that no Kṣatriya can eat of
<div n="lb"/>the sacrificial offering ({%Cf.%} Aitareya
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa, vii. 26): no doubt because
<div n="lb"/>only the Brāhmaṇas were sufficiently
<div n="lb"/>holy to receive the divine essence of
<div n="lb"/>the sacrifice into which, by partaking
<div n="lb"/>of it, the deity has entered in part.</F>

{@Ṛṣi,@}¦ ‘seer,’ is primarily a composer of hymns to the gods.
<div n="lb"/>In the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> reference is often made to previous singers
<div n="lb"/>and to contemporary poets. Old poems were inherited and
<div n="lb"/>refurbished by members of the composer's family,<sup>2</sup> but the
<div n="lb"/>great aim of the singers was to produce new and approved
<div n="lb"/>hymns.<sup>3</sup> It is not till the time of the Brāhmaṇas that the
[Page1-116+ 62]
<div n="lb"/>composition of hymns appears to have fallen into disuse,<sup>4</sup>
<div n="lb"/>though poetry was still produced, for example, in the form of
<div n="lb"/>{@Gāthās,@} which the priests were required to compose them-
<div n="lb"/>selves<sup>5</sup> and sing to the accompaniment of the lute at the
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice. The Ṛṣi was the most exalted of Brāhmaṇas,<sup>6</sup> and
<div n="lb"/>his skill, which is often compared with that of a carpenter,<sup>7</sup>
<div n="lb"/>was regarded as heaven-sent.<sup>8</sup> The Purohita, whether as Hotṛ
<div n="lb"/>or as Brahman (see {@Ṛtvij@}), was a singer.<sup>9</sup> No doubt the Ṛṣis
<div n="lb"/>were normally<sup>10</sup> attached to the houses of the great, the petty
<div n="lb"/>kings of Vedic times, or the nobles of the royal household.
<div n="lb"/>Nor need it be doubted that occasionally<sup>11</sup> the princes them-
<div n="lb"/>selves essayed poetry: a Rājanyarṣi, the prototype of the later
<div n="lb"/>Rājarṣi or ‘royal seer,’ who appears in the Pañcaviṃśa
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa,<sup>12</sup> though he must be mythical as Oldenberg<sup>13</sup>
<div n="lb"/>points out, indicates that kings cultivated poetry<sup>14</sup> just as later
<div n="lb"/>they engaged in philosophic disputations.<sup>15</sup> Normally, how-
<div n="lb"/>ever, the poetical function is Brahminical, Viśāmitra and others
<div n="lb"/>not being kings, but merely Brāhmaṇas, in the Rigveda.
<div n="P"/>In the later literature the Ṛṣis are the poets of the hymns
<div n="lb"/>preserved in the Saṃhitās. a Ṛṣi being regularly<sup>16</sup> cited when
<div n="lb"/>a Vedic Saṃhitā is quoted. Moreover, the Ṛṣis become the
<div n="lb"/>representatives of a sacred past, and are regarded as holy sages,
[Page1-117+ 56]
<div n="lb"/>whose deeds are narrated as if they were the deeds of gods or
<div n="lb"/>Asuras.<sup>17</sup> They are typified by a particular group of seven,<sup>18</sup>
<div n="lb"/>mentioned four times in the Rigveda,<sup>19</sup> several times in the
<div n="lb"/>later Saṃhitās,<sup>20</sup> and enumerated in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka
<div n="lb"/>Upaniṣad<sup>21</sup> as Gotama, Bharadvāja, Viśvāmitra, Jamadagni,
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha, Kaśyapa, and Atri. In the Rigveda itself Kutsa,<sup>22</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Atri,<sup>23</sup> Rebha,<sup>24</sup> Agastya,<sup>25</sup> the Kuśikas,<sup>26</sup> Vasiṣṭha,<sup>27</sup> Vyaśva,<sup>28</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and others appear as Ṛṣis; and the Atharvaveda<sup>29</sup> contains a
<div n="lb"/>long list, including Aṅgiras, Agastī, Jamadagni, Atri, Kaśyapa,
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha, Bharadvāja, Gaviṣṭhira, Viśvāmitra, Kutsa, Kakṣīvant,
<div n="lb"/>Kaṇva, Medhātithi, Triśoka, Uśanā Kāvya, Gotama, and
<div n="lb"/>Mudgala.
<div n="P"/>Competition among the bards appears to have been known.
<div n="lb"/>This is one of the sides of the riddle poetry ({@Brahmodya@}) that
<div n="lb"/>forms a distinctive feature<sup>30</sup> of the Vedic ritual of the Aśva-
<div n="lb"/>medha, or horse sacrifice. In the Upaniṣad period such
<div n="lb"/>competitions were quite frequent. The most famous was that
<div n="lb"/>of Yājñavalkya, which was held at the court of Janaka of
<div n="lb"/>Videha, as detailed in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad,<sup>31</sup> and
<div n="lb"/>which was a source of annoyance to {@Ajātaśatru@} of {@Kāśī.@}<sup>32</sup>
<div n="lb"/>According to an analogous practice, a Brāhmaṇa, like {@Uddālaka@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Aruṇi,@} would go about disputing with all he came across, and
<div n="lb"/>compete with them for a prize of money.<sup>33</sup>

{@Kāru,@}¦ ‘poet,’ is a word almost confined to the Rigveda.<sup>1</sup>
<div n="lb"/>There is evidence that the poet was regarded as a professional
<div n="lb"/>man, just as much as the physician ({@Bhiṣaj@}).<sup>2</sup> The poets, no
<div n="lb"/>doubt, mainly lived at the courts of princes amid their re-
<div n="lb"/>tainers,<sup>3</sup> though they would probably also sing the praises of rich
<div n="lb"/>merchants. There was probably no essential connexion between
<div n="lb"/>the priest and the poet. Though the priest was often a poet,
<div n="lb"/>yet poetry can hardly have been restricted to the priestly caste.
<div n="lb"/>Indeed, at the horse sacrifice (Aśvamedha) the Śatapatha
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa<sup>4</sup> expressly requires that one of the singers of pane-
<div n="lb"/>gyrics should be a Rājanya, while the other was a Brāhmaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>both singing verses of their own composition. The Anukra-
<div n="lb"/>maṇī (Index) in several cases<sup>5</sup> attributes hymns of the Rigveda
<div n="lb"/>to princes; and even though this may often be merely the
<div n="lb"/>same sort of procedure<sup>6</sup> as has made Śūdraka the author of

{@Kāśi, Kāśya.@}¦ — The name Kāśi denotes (in the plural<sup>1</sup>) the
<div n="lb"/>people of Kāśi (Benares), and Kāśya, the king of Kāśi. The
<div n="lb"/>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> tells of {@Dhṛtarāṣṭra,@} king of Kāśi, who
<div n="lb"/>was defeated by {@Śatānīka Sātrājita,@} with the result that the
<div n="lb"/>Kāśis, down to the time of the Brāhmaṇa, gave up the kindling
<div n="lb"/>of the sacred fire. Sātrājita was a {@Bharata.@} We hear also of
<div n="lb"/>{@Ajātaśatru@} as a king of Kāśi;<sup>3</sup> and no doubt {@Bhadrasena@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Ajātaśatrava,@} a contemporary of {@Uddālaka,@} was also a king of
<div n="lb"/>Kāśi.
<div n="P"/>The Kāśis and {@Videhas@} were closely connected, as was
<div n="lb"/>natural in view of their geographical position. The compound
<div n="lb"/>name Kāśi-Videha occurs in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad;<sup>4</sup> in the
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad<sup>5</sup> {@Gārgī@} describes Ajātaśatru as either
<div n="lb"/>a Kāśi or a Videha king. The Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra<sup>6</sup>
[Page1-154+ 49]
<div n="lb"/>mentions one Purohita as acting for the kings of Kāśi, Kosala,
<div n="lb"/>and Videha; and the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra<sup>7</sup> mentions Kāśi
<div n="lb"/>and Videha in close proximity. Weber,<sup>8</sup> indeed, throws out
<div n="lb"/>the suggestion that the Kāśis and the Videhas together con-
<div n="lb"/>stitute the {@Uśīnaras,@} whose name is very rare in Vedic
<div n="lb"/>literature.
<div n="P"/>As Kosala and Videha were in close connexion, Kāśi and
<div n="lb"/>Kosala are found combined in the compound name Kāśi-
<div n="lb"/>Kauśalyas of the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>9</sup>
<div n="P"/>Though Kāśi is a late word, it is quite possible that the town
<div n="lb"/>is older, as the river {@Varaṇāvatī@} referred to in the Athar-
<div n="lb"/>vaveda<sup>10</sup> may be connected with the later Vārāṇasī (Benares).
<div n="P"/>It is significant that while the Kāśis, Kosalas, and Videhas
<div n="lb"/>were united, any relations which the Kuru-Pañcala peoples
<div n="lb"/>may have had with them were hostile. It is a fair conclusion
<div n="lb"/>that between these two great groups of peoples there did exist
<div n="lb"/>some political conflict as well as probably a difference of culture
<div n="lb"/>in some degree. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>11</sup> in the story of the
<div n="lb"/>advance of Āryan civilization over Kosala and Videha, preserves
<div n="lb"/>a clear tradition of this time, and a piece of evidence that in
<div n="lb"/>the Kuru-Pañcāla country lay the real centre of the Brāhmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>culture (see also {@Kuru-Pañcāla@}). That the Kosala-Videhas
<div n="lb"/>were originally settlers of older date than the Kuru-Pañcālas
<div n="lb"/>is reasonably obvious from their geographical position, but the
<div n="lb"/>true Brāhmaṇa culture appears to have been brought to them
<div n="lb"/>from the Kuru-Pañcala country. It is very probable that the
<div n="lb"/>East was less Āryan than the West, and that it was less
<div n="lb"/>completely reduced under Brahmin spiritual supremacy, as the
<div n="lb"/>movement of Buddhism was Eastern, and the Buddhist texts<sup>12</sup>
<div n="lb"/>reveal a position in which the Kṣatriyas rank above Brāhmaṇas.
<div n="lb"/>With this agrees the fact that the later Vedic texts<sup>13</sup> display
[Page1-155+ 43]
<div n="lb"/>towards the people of Magadha a marked antipathy, which
<div n="lb"/>may be reasonably explained by that people's lack of orthodoxy,
<div n="lb"/>and which may perhaps be traced as far back as the Vājasaneyi
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitā.<sup>14</sup> It is, of course, possible that the Kosala-Videhas
<div n="lb"/>and Kāśis actually were merely offshoots of the tribes later
<div n="lb"/>known as the Kuru-Pañcālas, and that they by reason of
<div n="lb"/>distance and less complete subjugation of the aborigines lost
<div n="lb"/>their Brahminical culture. This hypothesis, however, appears
<div n="lb"/>less likely, though it might be supported by a literal inter-
<div n="lb"/>pretation of the legend of the Aryan migration in the Śatapatha
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa.<sup>15</sup>

<L>645<pc>1-165<k1>kuru<k2>kuru
{@Kuru.@}¦ — The Kurus appear as by far the most important
<div n="lb"/>people in the Brāhmaṇa literature. There is clear evidence
<div n="lb"/>that it was in the country of the Kurus, or the allied Kuru-
<div n="lb"/>Pañcālas, that the great Brāhmaṇas were composed.<sup>1</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>Kurus are comparatively seldom mentioned alone, their name
<div n="lb"/>being usually coupled with that of the Pañcālas on account of
<div n="lb"/>the intimate connexion of the two peoples. The Kuru-Pañcālas
<div n="lb"/>are often expressly referred to as a united nation.<sup>2</sup> In the land
<div n="lb"/>of the Kuru-Pañcālas speech is said to have its particular
<div n="lb"/>home;<sup>3</sup> the mode of sacrifice among the Kuru-Pañcālas is
<div n="lb"/>proclaimed to be the best;<sup>4</sup> the Kuru-Pañcāla kings perform
<div n="lb"/>the Rājasūya or royal sacrifice;<sup>5</sup> their princes march forth on
<div n="lb"/>raids in the dewy season, and return in the hot season.<sup>6</sup> Later
<div n="lb"/>on the Kuru-Pañcāla Brahmins are famous in the Upaniṣads.<sup>7</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Weber<sup>8</sup> and Grierson<sup>9</sup> have sought to find traces in Vedic
<div n="lb"/>literature of a breach between the two tribes, the latter scholar
<div n="lb"/>seeing therein a confirmation of the theory that the Kurus
<div n="lb"/>belonged to the later stream of immigrants into India, who
<div n="lb"/>were specially Brahminical, as opposed to the Pañcālas, who
<div n="lb"/>were anti-Brahminical. In support of this view, Weber refers
<div n="lb"/>to the story in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>10</sup> of a dispute between
<div n="lb"/>{@Vaka Dālbhya@} and {@Dhṛtarāṣṭra Vaicitravīrya,@} the former
<div n="lb"/>being held to be by origin a Pañcāla, while the latter is held
[Page1-166+ 51]
<div n="lb"/>to be a Kuru. But there is no trace of a quarrel between
<div n="lb"/>Kurus and Pañcālas in the passage in question, which merely
<div n="lb"/>preserves the record of a dispute on a ritual matter between a
<div n="lb"/>priest and a prince: the same passage refers to the Naimiṣīya
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice among the Kuru-Pañcālas, and emphasizes the close
<div n="lb"/>connexion of the two peoples.<sup>11</sup> Secondly, Weber conjectures
<div n="lb"/>in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā.<sup>12</sup> that {@Subhadrikā@} of {@Kāmpila@} was
<div n="lb"/>the chief queen of the king of a tribe living in the neighbour-
<div n="lb"/>hood of the clan, for whose king the horse sacrifice described
<div n="lb"/>in the Saṃhitā was performed. But the interpretation of this
<div n="lb"/>passage by Weber is open to grave doubt;<sup>13</sup> and in the Kāṇva
<div n="lb"/>recension of the Saṃhitā<sup>14</sup> a passage used at the Rājasūya
<div n="lb"/>shows that the Kuru-Pañcālas had actually one king. More-
<div n="lb"/>over, there is the evidence of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>15</sup> that
<div n="lb"/>the old name of the Pañcālas was {@Krivi.@} This word looks very
<div n="lb"/>like a variant of Kuru, and Zimmer<sup>16</sup> plausibly conjectures that
<div n="lb"/>the Kurus and Krivis formed the {@Vaikarṇa@}<sup>17</sup> of the Rigveda,
<div n="lb"/>especially as both peoples are found about the Sindhu and the
<div n="lb"/>Asiknī.<sup>18</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Kurus alone are chiefly mentioned in connexion with
<div n="lb"/>the locality which they occupied, {@Kurukṣetra,@} We are told,
<div n="lb"/>however, of a domestic priest ({@Purohita@}) in the service of both
<div n="lb"/>the Kurus and the {@Sṛñjayas,@}<sup>19</sup> who must therefore at one time
<div n="lb"/>have been closely connected.<sup>20</sup> In the Chāndogya Upaniṣad
<div n="lb"/>reference is made to the Kurus being saved by a mare ({%aśvā%}),<sup>21</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and to some disaster which befel them owing to a hailstorm.<sup>22</sup>
<div n="lb"/>In the Sūtras, again, a ceremony (Vājapeya) of the Kurus is
<div n="lb"/>mentioned.<sup>23</sup> There also a curse, which was pronounced on them
<div n="lb"/>and led to their being driven from Kurukṣetra, is alluded to.<sup>24</sup>
[Page1-167+ 46]
<div n="lb"/>This possibly adumbrates the misfortunes of the Kauravas in
<div n="lb"/>the epic tradition.
<div n="P"/>In the Rigveda the Kurus do not appear under that name as
<div n="lb"/>a people. But mention is made of a prince, {@Kuruśravaṇa@}
<div n="lb"/>(‘Glory of the Kurus’),<sup>25</sup> and of a {@Pākasthāman Kaurayāṇa.@}<sup>26</sup>
<div n="lb"/>In the Atharvaveda<sup>27</sup> there occurs as a king of the Kurus
<div n="lb"/>{@Parikṣit,@} whose son, {@Janamejaya,@} is mentioned in the Śata-
<div n="lb"/>patha Brāhmaṇa<sup>28</sup> as one of the great performers of the horse
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice.
<div n="P"/>It is a probable conjecture of Oldenberg's<sup>29</sup> that the Kuru
<div n="lb"/>people, as known later, included some of the tribes referred to
<div n="lb"/>by other names in the Rigveda. Kuruśravaṇa, shown by his
<div n="lb"/>name to be connected with the Kurus, is in the Rigveda called
<div n="lb"/>Trāsadasyava, ‘descendant of {@Trasadasyu,@}’ who is well known
<div n="lb"/>as a king of the {@Pūrus.@} Moreover, it is likely that the Tṛtsu-
<div n="lb"/>{@Bharatas,@} who appear in the Rigveda as enemies of the Pūtus,
<div n="lb"/>later coalesced with them to form the Kuru people.<sup>30</sup> Since the
<div n="lb"/>Bharatas appear so prominently in the Brāhmaṇa texts as a
<div n="lb"/>great people of the past, while the later literature ignores them
<div n="lb"/>in its list of nations, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that
<div n="lb"/>they became merged in some other tribe. Moreover, there is
<div n="lb"/>evidence that the Bharatas occupied the territory in which the
<div n="lb"/>Kurus were later found. Two of them are spoken of in a hymn
<div n="lb"/>of the Rigveda<sup>31</sup> as having kindled fire on the {@Dṛṣadvatī,@} the
<div n="lb"/>{@Āpayā,@} and the {@Sarasvatī@} — that is to say, in the sacred places
<div n="lb"/>of the later Kurukṣetra. Similarly, the goddess Bhāratī
<div n="lb"/>(‘belonging to the Bharatas’) is constantly mentioned in the
<div n="lb"/>Āprī (‘propitiatory’) hymns together with Sarasvatī.<sup>32</sup> Again,
<div n="lb"/>according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, one Bharata king was
<div n="lb"/>victorious over the Kāśis,<sup>33</sup> and another made offerings to
<div n="lb"/>Gaṅgā and Yamunā,<sup>34</sup> while raids of the Bharatas against the
<div n="lb"/>{@Satvants@} are mentioned in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>35</sup> Nor is it
[Page1-168+ 60]
<div n="lb"/>without importance that the Bharatas appear as a variant for
<div n="lb"/>the Kuru Pañcālas in a passage of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā,<sup>36</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and that in the list of the great performers of the horse sacrifice
<div n="lb"/>the names of one Kuru and two Bharata princes are given
<div n="lb"/>without any mention of the people over which they ruled,
<div n="lb"/>while in other cases that information is specifically given.<sup>37</sup>
<div n="P"/>The territory of the Kuru-Pañcālas is declared in the Aitareya
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa to be the middle country ({@Madhyadeśa@}).<sup>38</sup> A group
<div n="lb"/>of the Kuru people still remained further north — the {@Uttara@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Kurus@} beyond the Himālaya. It appears from a passage of
<div n="lb"/>the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa that the speech of the Northerners — 
<div n="lb"/>that is, presumably, the Northern Kurus — and of the Kuru-
<div n="lb"/>Pañcālas was similar, and regarded as specially pure.<sup>39</sup> There
<div n="lb"/>seems little doubt that the Brahminical culture was developed
<div n="lb"/>in the country of the Kuru-Pañcālas, and that it spread thence
<div n="lb"/>east, south, and west. Traces of this are seen in the Vrātya
<div n="lb"/>Stomas (sacrifices for the admission of non-Brahminical
<div n="lb"/>Āryans) of the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>40</sup> and in the fact that in
<div n="lb"/>the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka it is unusual for a Brahmin to dwell
<div n="lb"/>in the territory of {@Magadha.@}<sup>41</sup> The repeated mention of Kuru-
<div n="lb"/>Pañcāla Brahmins is another indication of their missionary
<div n="lb"/>activity.<sup>42</sup>
<div n="P"/>The geographical position of the Kuru-Pañcālas renders it
<div n="lb"/>probable that they were later immigrants into India than the
<div n="lb"/>{@Kosala-Videha@} or the {@Kāśis,@}<sup>43</sup> who must have been pushed
[Page1-169+ 71]
<div n="lb"/>into their more eastward territories by a new wave of Āryan
<div n="lb"/>settlers from the west. But there is no evidence in Vedic
<div n="lb"/>literature to show in what relation of time the immigration of
<div n="lb"/>the latter peoples stood to that of their neighbours on the west.
<div n="lb"/>It has, however, been conjectured,<sup>44</sup> mainly on the ground of
<div n="lb"/>later linguistic phenomena, which have no cogency for the
<div n="lb"/>Vedic period, that the Kurus were later immigrants, who,
<div n="lb"/>coming by a new route, thrust themselves between the original
<div n="lb"/>Āryan tribes which were already in occupation of the country
<div n="lb"/>from east to west. {%Cf.%} also {@Kṛtvan.@} For other Kuru princes

<div n="lb"/>this suggestion, which is not in itself
<div n="lb"/>plausible, disappears when it is realized
<div n="lb"/>that the Bharatas held a territory
<div n="lb"/>roughly corresponding to Kurukṣetra,

{@Kula, Kula-pā.@}¦ — As an uncompounded word, Kula does not

<div n="lb"/>itself, as connected with the home. The Kula-pā (lit. ‘house
<div n="lb"/>protector’), or chief of the family, is mentioned in the Rigveda<sup>2</sup>
<div n="lb"/>as inferior to and attendant on the {@Vrājapati@} in war, the latter
<div n="lb"/>being perhaps the leader of the village contingent of the clan.
<div n="lb"/>In the Atharvaveda<sup>3</sup> a girl is ironically called Kulapā, because
<div n="lb"/>she is left without a husband in the world, and has only Yama
<div n="lb"/>(the god of death) for a spouse.
<div n="P"/>The use of the term Kula points clearly to a system of
<div n="lb"/>individual families, each no doubt consisting of several members
<div n="lb"/>under the headship of the father or eldest brother, whose Kula
<div n="lb"/>the dwelling is. As distinct from {@Gotra,@} Kula seems to mean

{@Kṛṣi,@}¦ ‘ploughing.’ The cultivation of the soil was no doubt
<div n="lb"/>known to the Indians before they separated from the Iranians,
<div n="lb"/>as is indicated by the identity of the expressions {%yavaṃ kṛṣ%} and
<div n="lb"/>{%sasya%} in the Rigveda with {%yao karesh%} and {%hahya%} in the Avesta,
<div n="lb"/>referring to the ploughing in of the seed and to the grain
<div n="lb"/>which resulted.<sup>1</sup> But it is not without significance that the
<div n="lb"/>expressions for ploughing occur mainly in the first<sup>2</sup> and tenth<sup>3</sup>
<div n="lb"/>books of the Rigveda, and only rarely in the so-called ‘family’
<div n="lb"/>books (ii.-vii.).<sup>4</sup> In the Atharvaveda {@Pṛthī Vainya@} is credited
<div n="lb"/>with the origination of ploughing,<sup>5</sup> and even in the Rigveda
<div n="lb"/>the Aśvins are spoken of as concerned with the sowing of grain
<div n="lb"/>by means of the plough.<sup>6</sup> In the later Saṃhitās and the
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇas ploughing is repeatedly referred to.<sup>7</sup>
[Page1-182+ 51]
<div n="P"/>Even in the Rigveda<sup>8</sup> there is clear proof of the importance
<div n="lb"/>attached to agriculture. In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>9</sup> the
<div n="lb"/>{@Vrātyas,@} Hindus without the pale of Brahminism, are de-
<div n="lb"/>scribed as not cultivating the soil.
<div n="P"/>The plough land was called {@Urvarā@} or {@Kṣetra;@} manure
<div n="lb"/>({@Śakan, Karīṣa@}) was used, and irrigation was practised ({@Khani-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@tra@}). The plough ({@Lāṅgala, Sīra@}) was drawn by oxen, teams of
<div n="lb"/>six, eight, or even twelve being employed.<sup>10</sup> The operations of
<div n="lb"/>agriculture are neatly summed up in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>11</sup>
<div n="lb"/>as ‘ploughing, sowing, reaping, and threshing’ ({%kṛṣantaḥ,%}
<div n="lb"/>{%vapantaḥ, lunantaḥ, mṛṇantaḥ%}). The ripe grain was cut with
<div n="lb"/>a sickle ({@Dātra, Sṛṇi@}), bound into bundles<sup>12</sup> ({@Parṣa@}), and beaten
<div n="lb"/>out on the floor of the granary ({@Khala@}).<sup>13</sup> The grain was then
<div n="lb"/>separated from the straw and refuse either by a sieve ({@Titau@})
<div n="lb"/>or a winnowing fan ({@Śūrpa@}).<sup>14</sup> The winnower was called
<div n="lb"/>{@Dhānyākṛt,@}<sup>15</sup> and the grain was measured in a vessel called
<div n="lb"/>{@Urdara.@}<sup>16</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Rigveda leaves us in doubt as to the kind of grain
<div n="lb"/>grown, for {@Yava@} is a word of doubtful signification, and {@Dhānā@}
<div n="lb"/>is also vague. In the later Saṃhitās<sup>17</sup> things are different.
<div n="lb"/>Rice ({@Vrīhi@}) appears, Yava means barley, with a species
<div n="lb"/>styled {@Upavāka.@} Beans ({@Mudga, Māṣa@}), sesamum ({@Tila@}), and
<div n="lb"/>other grains ({@Aṇu, Khalva, Godhūma, Nīvāra, Priyaṅgu,@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Masūra, Śyāmāka@}) are mentioned, while cucumbers ({@Urvārū,@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Uryārūka@}) were known. It is uncertain whether fruit trees
<div n="lb"/>({@Vṛkṣa@}) were cultivated, or merely grew wild;<sup>18</sup> but frequent
<div n="lb"/>mention is made of the jujube ({@Karkandhu, Kuvala, Badara.@}).
<div n="P"/>The seasons for agriculture are briefly summed up in a
<div n="lb"/>passage of the Taittirīya Saṃhitā:<sup>19</sup> barley ripened in summer,
<div n="lb"/>being no doubt sown, as in modern India, in winter; rice
[Page1-183+ 52]
<div n="lb"/>ripened in autumn, being sown in the beginning of the rains;
<div n="lb"/>beans and sesamum, planted at the time of the summer rains,
<div n="lb"/>ripened in the winter and the cool season. There were two
<div n="lb"/>harvests ({@Sasya@}) a year according to the Taittirīya Saṃhitā;<sup>20</sup>
<div n="lb"/>the winter crop was ripe by the month of Caitra (March-April)
<div n="lb"/>according to the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa.<sup>21</sup>
<div n="P"/>The farmer had plenty of trouble of his own: moles destroyed
<div n="lb"/>the seed, birds and various kinds of reptiles ({@Upakvasa, Jabhya,@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Tarda, Pataṅga@}) injured the young shoots, excessive rain or
<div n="lb"/>drought might damage the crops. The Atharvaveda contains
<div n="lb"/>spells to prevent these evils.<sup>22</sup>

2. {@Keśin Dārbhya@}¦<sup>1</sup> or {@Dālbhya@}<sup>2</sup> (‘descendant of Darbha’) is a
<div n="lb"/>somewhat enigmatic figure. According to the Śatapatha Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa<sup>3</sup> and the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmana<sup>4</sup> he was a king,
<div n="lb"/>sister's son of {@Uccaiḥśravas,@} according to the latter authority.
<div n="lb"/>His people were the {@Pañcālas,@} of whom the Keśins must there-
<div n="lb"/>fore have been a branch, and who are said to have been threefold
<div n="lb"/>({%tryanīka%}).<sup>5</sup> A story is told of his having a ritual dispute with
<div n="lb"/>{@Ṣaṇḍika@} in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā<sup>6</sup> this appears in another
<div n="lb"/>form in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>3</sup> He was a contemporary
<div n="lb"/>of a fellow sage, {@Keśin Sātyakāmi,@} according to the Maitrā-
<div n="lb"/>yaṇī<sup>7</sup> and Taittirīya<sup>8</sup> Saṃhitās. The Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>9</sup>
<div n="lb"/>attributes to him a Sāman or chant, and the Kauṣītaki Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa<sup>10</sup> tells how he was taught by a golden bird.
<div n="P"/>In view of the fact that the early literature always refers to
<div n="lb"/>Dārbhya as a sage, it seems doubtful whether the commentator
<div n="lb"/>is right in thinking that the Śatapatha refers to a king and
<div n="lb"/>a people, when a sage alone may well be meant, while the
<div n="lb"/>Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa is of no great authority. The
<div n="lb"/>latter work may have assumed that the reference in the Kāṭhaka
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitā<sup>11</sup> to the Keśin people signifies kingship, but this is
<div n="lb"/>hardly necessary.
<F>1) This is the form of the name in
<div n="lb"/>the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, the Taittirīya

{@Kraya,@}¦ ‘sale,’ is a word which does not actually occur in the

<div n="lb"/>is found there.<sup>1</sup> Both noun and verb are common in the later
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitās.<sup>2</sup> Sale appears to have regularly consisted in barter
<div n="lb"/>in the Rigveda:<sup>3</sup> ten cows are regarded as a possible price for
<div n="lb"/>an (image of) Indra to be used as a fetish, while elsewhere not
<div n="lb"/>a hundred, nor a thousand, nor a myriad are considered as an
<div n="lb"/>adequate price ({%śulka%}) for the purchase of Indra.<sup>4</sup> The Athar-
<div n="lb"/>vaveda<sup>5</sup> mentions, as possible objects of commerce, garments
<div n="lb"/>({%dūrśa%}), coverlets ({%pavasta%}), and goatskins ({%ajina%}). The haggling
<div n="lb"/>of the market was already familiar in the days of the Rigveda,<sup>6</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and a characteristic hymn of the Atharvaveda<sup>7</sup> is directed to
<div n="lb"/>procuring success in trade. The ‘price’ was called {@Vasna,@} and
<div n="lb"/>the ‘merchant’ {@Vaṇij.@} his greed being well known.<sup>8</sup>
<div n="P"/>There is little evidence of a standard of value in currency
<div n="lb"/>having been adopted. When no specific mention is made of
<div n="lb"/>the standard, the unit was probably the cow.<sup>9</sup> In a consider-
<div n="lb"/>able number of passages of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>10</sup> and
<div n="lb"/>elsewhere,<sup>11</sup> however, the expression {%hiraṇyaṃ śata-mānam%}
<div n="lb"/>suggests that there must have been some standard other than
[Page1-197+ 48]
<div n="lb"/>cows, though it might in all these passages be rendered as
<div n="lb"/>‘gold worth a hundred cows.’ But the use of the {@Kṛṣṇala@} as a
<div n="lb"/>measure of weight<sup>12</sup> suggests that the meaning is ‘gold weighing
<div n="lb"/>a hundred Kṛṣṇalas,’ and this seems the more probable explana-
<div n="lb"/>tion. This unit seems not to be known in the Rigveda, where
<div n="lb"/>the meaning of the term {@Manā,@} which occurs once, is mysterious,
<div n="lb"/>and where necklets ({@Niṣka@}) seem to have been one of the more
<div n="lb"/>portable forms of wealth, like jewellery in modern India, and

{@Kṣatriya.@}¦ — As the origin of caste, the relation of the castes,
<div n="lb"/>intermarriage, and cognate matters may most conveniently be
<div n="lb"/>discussed under {@Varṇa,@} this article will be confined to deter-
<div n="lb"/>mining, as far as possible, the real character of the class called
<div n="lb"/>Kṣatriyas, or collectively {@Kṣatra.@}
<div n="P"/>The evidence of the Jātakas<sup>1</sup> points to the word Khattiya
[Page1-203+ 47]
<div n="lb"/>denoting the members of the old Āryan nobility who had led
<div n="lb"/>the tribes to conquest, {@as well@} as those families of the aborigines
<div n="lb"/>who had managed to maintain their princely status in spite
<div n="lb"/>of the conquest. In the epic<sup>2</sup> also the term Kṣatriya seems to
<div n="lb"/>include these persons, but it has probably a wider signification
<div n="lb"/>than Khattiya, and would cover all the royal military vassals
<div n="lb"/>and feudal chiefs, expressing, in fact, pretty much the same
<div n="lb"/>as the {%barones%} of early English history. Neither in the
<div n="lb"/>Jātakas<sup>3</sup> nor in the epic<sup>4</sup> is the term co-extensive with all
<div n="lb"/>warriors; the army contains many besides the Kṣatriyas, who
<div n="lb"/>are the leaders or officers, rather than the rank and file.
<div n="P"/>In the later Saṃhitās<sup>5</sup> and the Brāhmaṇas<sup>6</sup> the Kṣatriya
<div n="lb"/>stands as a definite member of the social body, distinct from
<div n="lb"/>the priest, the subject people, and the slaves, {@Brāhmaṇa,@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Vaiśya,@} and {@Śūdra.@} It is significant that Rājanya is a variant
<div n="lb"/>to Kṣatriya, and an earlier one. Hence it is reasonable to
<div n="lb"/>suppose that the Kṣatriya and Rājanya are both of similar
<div n="lb"/>origin, being princely or connected with royalty. Moreover,
<div n="lb"/>the early use of Kṣatriya in the Rigveda<sup>7</sup> is exclusively con-
<div n="lb"/>nected with royal authority or divine authority.
<div n="P"/>It is impossible to say exactly what persons would be in-
<div n="lb"/>cluded in the term Kṣatriya. That it covered the royal house
<div n="lb"/>and the various branches of the royal family may be regarded
<div n="lb"/>as certain. It, no doubt, also included the nobles and their
<div n="lb"/>families: this would explain the occasional opposition of
<div n="lb"/>Rājanya and Kṣatriya, as in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>8</sup> where
<div n="lb"/>a Rājanya asks a Kṣatriya for a place for sacrifice ({%deva-yajana%}).
<div n="lb"/>Thus, when strictly applied, Kṣatriya would have a wider
<div n="lb"/>denotation than Rājanya. As a rule, however, the two
<div n="lb"/>expressions are identical, and both are used as evidence in
<div n="lb"/>what follows. That Kṣatriya ever included the mere fighting
[Page1-204+ 72]
<div n="lb"/>man has not been proved: in the Rigveda<sup>9</sup> and later<sup>10</sup> others
<div n="lb"/>than Kṣatriyas regularly fought; but possibly if the nobles had
<div n="lb"/>retinues as the kings had, Kṣatriya would embrace those
<div n="lb"/>retainers who had military functions. The term did not apply
<div n="lb"/>to all members of the royal entourage; for example, the
<div n="lb"/>{@Grāmaṇī@} was usually a Vaiśya.
<div n="P"/>The connexion of the Kṣatriyas with the Brahmins was very
<div n="lb"/>close. The prosperity of the two is repeatedly asserted<sup>11</sup> to
<div n="lb"/>be indissolubly associated, especially in the relation of king
<div n="lb"/>({@Rājan@}) and domestic priest ({@Purohita@}). Sometimes there was
<div n="lb"/>feud between Kṣatriya and Brahmin.<sup>12</sup> His management of the
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice then gave the Brahmin power to ruin the Kṣatriya by
<div n="lb"/>embroiling him with the people<sup>13</sup> or with other Kṣatriyas.<sup>14</sup>
<div n="P"/>Towards the common people, on the other hand, the Kṣa-
<div n="lb"/>triya stood in a relation of well-nigh unquestioned superiority.<sup>15</sup>
<div n="lb"/>There are, however, references to occasional feuds between
[Page1-205+ 60]
<div n="lb"/>the people and the nobles,<sup>16</sup> in which no doubt the inferior
<div n="lb"/>numbers of the latter were compensated by their superior arms
<div n="lb"/>and prowess. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>17</sup> the Vaiśya is
<div n="lb"/>described as tributary to another ({%anyasya bali-kṛt%}), to be
<div n="lb"/>devoured by another ({%anyasyādya%}), and to be oppressed at will
<div n="lb"/>({%yathākāma-jyeya%}). Probably these epithets apply most strictly
<div n="lb"/>to the relation of the king and his people, but the passage
<div n="lb"/>shows that the people were greatly at the mercy of the nobles.
<div n="lb"/>No doubt the king granted to them the right, which may have
<div n="lb"/>been hereditary, to be supported by the common people,
<div n="lb"/>whose feudal superiors they thus became. In return for these
<div n="lb"/>privileges the Kṣatriyas had probably duties of protection to
<div n="lb"/>perform, as well as some judicial functions, to judge from an
<div n="lb"/>obscure passage of the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā.<sup>18</sup>
<div n="P"/>The main duty of the Kṣatriya in the small states<sup>19</sup> of the
<div n="lb"/>Vedic period was readiness for war. The bow is thus his
<div n="lb"/>special attribute,<sup>20</sup> just as the goad is that of the agriculturist;
<div n="lb"/>for the bow is the main weapon of the Veda. Whether the
<div n="lb"/>Kṣatriyas paid much attention to mental occupations is
<div n="lb"/>uncertain. In the latest stratum of the Brāhmaṇa literature
<div n="lb"/>there are references to learned princes like {@Janaka@} of {@Videha,@}
<div n="lb"/>who is said to have become a Brahmin ({%brahmā%}), apparently in
<div n="lb"/>the sense that he had the full knowledge which a Brahmin
<div n="lb"/>possessed.<sup>21</sup> Other learned Kṣatriyas of this period were
[Page1-206+ 62]
<div n="lb"/>{@Pravāhaṇa Jaivali,@}<sup>22</sup> {@Aśvapati Kaikeya,@}<sup>23</sup> and Ajātaśatru.<sup>24</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Garbe,<sup>25</sup> Grierson,<sup>26</sup> and others believe they are justified in
<div n="lb"/>holding the view that the Ksatriyas developed a special
<div n="lb"/>philosophy of their own as opposed to Brahminism, which
<div n="lb"/>appears later as Bhakti, or Faith. On the other hand, there
<div n="lb"/>is clear evidence<sup>27</sup> that the opinion of Ksatriyas on such topics
<div n="lb"/>were held in little respect, and it must be remembered that to
<div n="lb"/>attribute wisdom to a king was a delicate and effective piece
<div n="lb"/>of flattery. There are earlier references to royal sages ({%rājan-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%yarṣi%}),<sup>28</sup> but it is very doubtful if much stress can be laid on
<div n="lb"/>them, and none can be laid on the later tradition of Sāyaṇa.<sup>29</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Again, the Nirukta<sup>30</sup> gives a tradition relating how {@Devāpi,@}
<div n="lb"/>a king's son, became the Purohita of his younger brother
<div n="lb"/>{@Śaṃtanu;@} but it is very doubtful if the story can really be
<div n="lb"/>traced with Sieg<sup>31</sup> in the Rigveda<sup>32</sup> itself. In any case, the
<div n="lb"/>stories refer only to a few selected Kṣatriyas of high rank,
<div n="lb"/>while there is no evidence that the average Kṣatriya was
<div n="lb"/>concerned with intellectual pursuits. Nor is there any
<div n="lb"/>reference to Kṣatriyas engaging in agriculture or in trade
<div n="lb"/>or commerce. It may be assumed that the duties of
<div n="lb"/>administration and war were adequate to absorb his atten-
<div n="lb"/>tion. On the other hand, we do hear of a Rājanya
[Page1-207+ 54]
<div n="lb"/>as a lute player and singer at the Aśvamedha or horse
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice.<sup>33</sup>
<div n="P"/>Of the training and education of a Kṣatriya we have no
<div n="lb"/>record; presumably, as in fact if not in theory later on, he was
<div n="lb"/>mainly instructed in the art of war, the science of the bow, and
<div n="lb"/>the rudimentary administrative functions which would devolve
<div n="lb"/>on him. At this early state of the development of the nobility
<div n="lb"/>which appears to be represented in the Rigveda, it was probably
<div n="lb"/>not unusual or impossible for a Vaiśya to become a Kṣatriya;
<div n="lb"/>at least, this assumption best explains the phrase<sup>34</sup> ‘claiming
<div n="lb"/>falsely a Kṣatriya's rank’ ({%kṣatriyaṃ mithuyā dhārayantam%}).
<div n="P"/>The king and the Kṣatriyas must have stood in a particularly
<div n="lb"/>close relation. The former being the Kṣatriya {%par excellence,%}
<div n="lb"/>it is to him rather than to the ordinary Kṣatriya that we must
<div n="lb"/>refer passages like that in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>35</sup> where it
<div n="lb"/>is said that the Kṣatriya, with the consent of the clansmen,
<div n="lb"/>gives a settlement to a man: clearly a parallel to the rule found
<div n="lb"/>among many peoples that the chief, but only with the consent of
<div n="lb"/>the people, can make a grant of unoccupied land. In the same
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa<sup>36</sup> it is said that a Kṣatriya consecrates a Kṣatriya, a
<div n="lb"/>clear reference, as the commentator explains, to the practice of
<div n="lb"/>the old king consecrating the prince ({%kumāra%}) who is to succeed
<div n="lb"/>him; and again,<sup>37</sup> the Kṣatriya and the Purohita are regarded
<div n="lb"/>as alone complete in contrast with other people, the parallel
<div n="lb"/>with the Purohita here suggesting that the Kṣatriya {%par excellence%}
<div n="lb"/>is meant. On the other hand, the king is sometimes con-
<div n="lb"/>trasted with the Rājanya.<sup>38</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Sūtra literature contains elaborate rules<sup>39</sup> for the educa-
[Page1-208+ 49]
<div n="lb"/>tion and occupations of Kṣatriyas, but their contents cannot
<div n="lb"/>always be traced in the Brāhmaṇa literature, and their value is
<div n="lb"/>questionable.

<div n="lb"/>to have the general sense of ‘blade’<sup>1</sup> in one passage,<sup>2</sup> possibly
<div n="lb"/>also in another,<sup>3</sup> where it is said that the hare swallowed a

<div n="lb"/>Kṣura, and where the sense ‘blade’ is adequate. In the third

<div n="lb"/>Muir,<sup>7</sup> following another view of Roth,<sup>8</sup> adopts the sense ‘the

<div n="lb"/>passage, one in the Atharvaveda,<sup>9</sup> where a Kṣura is described
<div n="lb"/>as moving about on the {%bhurijos,%}<sup>10</sup> as the tongue on the lip. The
<div n="lb"/>meaning ‘razor’ is perfectly clear in the Atharvaveda,<sup>11</sup> where
<div n="lb"/>shaving by means of it is mentioned; in many other passages<sup>12</sup>
<div n="lb"/>either sense is adequate. A {%kṣuro bhṛjvān%} occurs in the Yajur-

{@Gāthā@}¦ in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> usually means only ‘song,’ ‘verse,’
<div n="lb"/>like Gātu.<sup>2</sup> In one passage,<sup>3</sup> however, it already has a more
<div n="lb"/>special sense, as it is classed with {@Nārāśaṃsī@} and {@Raibhī,@} a
<div n="lb"/>collocation repeatedly found later.<sup>4</sup> The commentators identify
<div n="lb"/>the three terms with certain verses of the Atharvaveda,<sup>5</sup> but
<div n="lb"/>Oldenberg<sup>6</sup> has shown that this identification is incorrect for
<div n="lb"/>the Rigveda. Gāthās are often mentioned elsewhere,<sup>7</sup> and are
<div n="lb"/>referred to as metrical in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka,<sup>8</sup> where the
<div n="lb"/>{@Ṛc, Kumbyā,@} and Gāthā are classed as forms of verse. The
<div n="lb"/>Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>9</sup> distinguishes between Ṛc and Gāthā as
<div n="lb"/>divine and human respectively. According to the usage of the
[Page1-225+ 51]
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇas and the liturgical literature, as stated by the St.
<div n="lb"/>Petersburg Dictionary, the Gāthās are, though religious in
<div n="lb"/>content, distinguished from Ṛc, Yajus, and Sāman as non-
<div n="lb"/>Vedic — that is, are not Mantras. This view is consistent with
<div n="lb"/>the fact that the phrase {@Yajña-gāthā,@} meaning a verse
<div n="lb"/>summarizing a sacrificial usage, is not rare. The Śatapatha
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa<sup>10</sup> preserves several Gāthās, which generally accord
<div n="lb"/>with this description as epitomizing the sacrifices of famous
<div n="lb"/>kings, and the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā<sup>11</sup> states that a Gāthā is
<div n="lb"/>sung at a wedding. Sometimes<sup>12</sup> Gāthā is qualified as
<div n="lb"/>Nārāśaṃsī, where it must be a eulogy of a generous donor.

{@Gṛha@}¦ is used in the singular,<sup>1</sup> or oftener in the plural,<sup>2</sup> to

[Page1-230+ 62]
<div n="lb"/>the same sense, while {@Pastyā@} and {@Harmya@} denote more
<div n="lb"/>especially the home with its surroundings, the family settle-
<div n="lb"/>ment. The house held not only the family, which might be of
<div n="lb"/>considerable size, but also the cattle<sup>3</sup> and the sheep<sup>4</sup> at night.
<div n="lb"/>It was composed of several rooms, as the use of the plural
<div n="lb"/>indicates, and it could be securely shut up.<sup>5</sup> The door ({@Dvār,@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Dvāra@}) is often referred to, and from it the house is called
<div n="lb"/>{@Duroṇa.@} In every house the fire was kept burning.<sup>6</sup>
<div n="P"/>Very little is known of the structure of the house. Presum-
<div n="lb"/>ably stone was not used,<sup>7</sup> and houses were, as in Megasthenes'
<div n="lb"/>time,<sup>8</sup> built of wood. The hymns of the Atharvaveda<sup>9</sup> give
<div n="lb"/>some information about the construction of a house, but the
<div n="lb"/>details are extremely obscure, for most of the expressions used
<div n="lb"/>do not recur in any context in which their sense is clear.
<div n="lb"/>According to Zimmer,<sup>10</sup> four pillars ({@Upamit@}) were set up on a
<div n="lb"/>good site, and against them beams were leant at an angle as
<div n="lb"/>props ({@Pratimit@}). The upright pillars were connected by cross
<div n="lb"/>beams ({@Parimit@}) resting upon them. The roof was formed of
<div n="lb"/>ribs of bamboo cane ({%vaṃśa%}),<sup>11</sup> a ridge called {@Viṣūvant,@} and a
<div n="lb"/>net ({@Akṣu@}), which may mean a thatched covering<sup>12</sup> over the
<div n="lb"/>bamboo ribs. The walls were filled up with grass in bundles
<div n="lb"/>({%palada%}), and the whole structure was held together with ties of
[Page1-231+ 53]
<div n="lb"/>various sorts ({%nahana, prāṇāha, saṃdaṃśa, pariṣvañjalya%}).<sup>13</sup> In
<div n="lb"/>connexion with the house, mention is made of four terms which,
<div n="lb"/>though primarily sacrificial in meaning, seem to designate parts
<div n="lb"/>of the building: Havirdhāna, ‘oblation-holder’; Agniśāla,<sup>14</sup> ‘fire-
<div n="lb"/>place’; Patnīnāṃ Sadana, ‘wives’ room’; and Sadas, ‘sitting
<div n="lb"/>room.’ Slings or hanging vessels ({@Śikya@}) are also mentioned.<sup>15</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Reedwork ({%iṭa%}) is spoken of, no doubt as part of the finishing
<div n="lb"/>of the walls of the house.<sup>16</sup> The sides are called {@Pakṣa.@} The
<div n="lb"/>door with its framework was named {@Ātā.@}

1. {@Go@}¦ ({%a%}), ‘ox’ or ‘cow.’<sup>1</sup> These were among the chief
<div n="lb"/>sources of wealth to the Vedic Indian, and are repeatedly
[Page1-232+ 62]
<div n="lb"/>referred to from the Rigveda onwards.<sup>2</sup> The milk ({@Kṣīra@}) was
<div n="lb"/>either drunk fresh or made into butter ({@Ghṛta@}) or curds ({@Dadhi@}),
<div n="lb"/>or was mixed with {@Soma@} or used for cooking with grain
<div n="lb"/>({@Kṣīraudana@}). The cows were milked thrice a day, early
<div n="lb"/>({%prātar-doha%}), in the forenoon ({@Saṃgava@}), and in the evening
<div n="lb"/>({%sāyaṃ-doha%}).<sup>3</sup> Thrice a day they were driven out to graze,
<div n="lb"/>according to the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>4</sup> ({%prātaḥ, saṃgave, sāyam%}).
<div n="lb"/>The first milking was productive, the last two scanty.<sup>3</sup> According
<div n="lb"/>to the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>5</sup> among the Bharatas the herds in
<div n="lb"/>the evening are in the {@Goṣṭha,@} at midday in the {@Saṃgavīnī.@}
<div n="lb"/>This passage Sāyaṇa expands by saying that the herds go home
<div n="lb"/>to the Śālā, or house for animals, at night so far as they consist
<div n="lb"/>of animals giving milk, while the others stayed out in the
<div n="lb"/>Goṣṭha, or open pasturage; but both were together in the
<div n="lb"/>cattle-shed during the heat of the day. The time before
<div n="lb"/>the Saṃgava, when the cows were grazing freely on the
<div n="lb"/>pastureland, was called {@Svasara.@}<sup>6</sup> When the cows were out
<div n="lb"/>feeding they were separated from the calves, which were, how-
<div n="lb"/>ever, allowed to join them at the Saṃgava,<sup>7</sup> and sometimes in
<div n="lb"/>the evening.<sup>8</sup>
<div n="P"/>While grazing the cattle were under the care of a herdsman
<div n="lb"/>({@Gopā, Gopāla@}) armed with a goad,<sup>9</sup> but they were liable to all sorts
<div n="lb"/>of dangers, such as being lost, falling into pits, breaking limbs,<sup>10</sup>
[Page1-233+ 60]
<div n="lb"/>and being stolen. The marking of the ears of cattle was
<div n="lb"/>repeatedly adopted, no doubt, to indicate ownership.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="P"/>Large herds of cattle were well-known, as is shown by the
<div n="lb"/>Dānastutis, or ‘praises of gifts,’ in the Rigveda,<sup>12</sup> even when
<div n="lb"/>allowances are made for the exaggeration of priestly gratitude.
<div n="lb"/>The importance attached to the possession of cattle is shown<sup>13</sup>
<div n="lb"/>by the numerous passages in which the gods are asked to prosper
<div n="lb"/>them, and by the repeated prayers<sup>14</sup> for wealth in kine. Hence,
<div n="lb"/>too, forays for cattle ({@Gaviṣṭi@}) were well known; the Bharata
<div n="lb"/>host is called the ‘horde desiring cows’ ({%gavyan grāmaḥ%}) in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda;<sup>15</sup> and a verbal root {%gup,%}<sup>16</sup> ‘to protect,’ was evolved as
<div n="lb"/>early as the Rigveda from the denominative {%go-pāya,%} ‘to guard
<div n="lb"/>cows.’ The Vedic poets<sup>17</sup> do not hesitate to compare their
<div n="lb"/>songs with the lowing of cows, or to liken the choir of the
<div n="lb"/>singing Apsarases to cows.<sup>18</sup>
<div n="P"/>The cattle of the Vedic period were of many colours: red
<div n="lb"/>({%rohita%}), light ({%śukra%}), dappled ({%pṛśni%}), even black ({%kṛṣṇa%}).<sup>19</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Zimmer<sup>20</sup> sees a reference to cows with blazes on the face in one
<div n="lb"/>passage of the Rigveda,<sup>21</sup> but this is uncertain.
<div n="P"/>Oxen were regularly used for ploughing or for drawing
<div n="lb"/>wagons ({%anaḍvāh%}), in which case they were, it seems, usually
<div n="lb"/>castrated.<sup>22</sup> Cows were not properly used for drawing carts,
<div n="lb"/>though they at times did so.<sup>23</sup> The flesh of both cows and
<div n="lb"/>bulls was sometimes eaten ({@Māmsa@}). Cattle were certainly the
[Page1-234+ 44]
<div n="lb"/>objects of individual ownership, and they formed one of the
<div n="lb"/>standards of exchange and valuation (see {@Kraya@}).
<div n="P"/>({%b%}) The term {@Go@} is often applied to express the products of
<div n="lb"/>the cow. It frequently means the milk,<sup>1</sup> but rarely the flesh<sup>2</sup> of
<div n="lb"/>the animal. In many passages it designates leather used as the
<div n="lb"/>material of various objects, as a bowstring,<sup>3</sup> or a sling,<sup>4</sup> or
<div n="lb"/>thongs to fasten part of the chariot,<sup>5</sup> or reins,<sup>6</sup> or the lash

<div n="P"/>In the Gṛhya Sūtras<sup>5</sup> stress is laid on the prohibition of

<div n="lb"/>marriage within a Gotra, or with a Sapiṇḍa of the mother of
<div n="lb"/>the bridegroom — that is to say, roughly, with agnates and
<div n="lb"/>cognates. Senart<sup>6</sup> has emphasized this fact as a basis of caste,
<div n="lb"/>on the ground that marriage within a {%curia, phratria,%} or caste
<div n="lb"/>({@Varṇa@}) was Indo-European, as was marriage outside the circle
<div n="lb"/>of agnates and cognates. But there is no evidence at all<sup>7</sup> to
<div n="lb"/>prove that this practice was Indo-European, while in India the
<div n="lb"/>Śatapatha<sup>8</sup> expressly recognizes marriage within the third or
<div n="lb"/>fourth degree on either side. According to Sāyaṇa, the Kāṇvas
<div n="lb"/>accepted marriage in the third degree, the Saurāṣṭras only in
<div n="lb"/>the fourth, while the scholiast on the Vajrasūcī<sup>9</sup> adḍs to the
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇvas the Andhras and the Dākṣiṇātyas, and remarks that
<div n="lb"/>the Vājasaneyins forbade marriage with the daughter of the
<div n="lb"/>mother's brother. All apparently allowed marriage with the

{@Graha@}¦ (‘seizing’) is a term applied to the sun in the Śata-
<div n="lb"/>patha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>1</sup> most probably not in the later sense of
<div n="lb"/>‘planet,’ but to denote a power exercising magical influence.<sup>2</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The sense of ‘planet’ seems first to occur in the later literature,
<div n="lb"/>as in the Maitrāyaṇī Upaniṣad.<sup>3</sup> The question whether the
<div n="lb"/>planets were known to the Vedic Indians is involved in
<div n="lb"/>obscurity. Oldenberg<sup>4</sup> recognizes them in the Ādityas, whose
<div n="lb"/>number is, he believes, seven; sun, moon, and the five planets.
<div n="lb"/>But this view, though it cannot be said to be impossible or even
<div n="lb"/>unlikely, is not susceptible of proof, and has been rejected by
<div n="lb"/>Hillebrandt,<sup>5</sup> Pischel,<sup>6</sup> von Schroeder,<sup>7</sup> Macdonell,<sup>8</sup> and Bloom-
<div n="lb"/>field,<sup>9</sup> among others. Hillebrandt<sup>10</sup> sees the planets in the five
<div n="lb"/>Adhvaryus mentioned in the Rigveda,<sup>11</sup> but this is a mere con-
<div n="lb"/>jecture. The five bulls ({%ukṣāṇaḥ%}) in another passage of the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda<sup>12</sup> have received a similar interpretation with equal
<div n="lb"/>uncertainty,<sup>13</sup> and Durga, in his commentary on the Nirukta,<sup>14</sup>
<div n="lb"/>even explains the term {%bhūmija,%} ‘earth-born,’ which is only men-
<div n="lb"/>tioned by Yāska, as meaning the planet Mars.<sup>15</sup> Thibaut,<sup>16</sup>
<div n="lb"/>who is generally sceptical as to the mention of planets in the
<div n="lb"/>Veda, thinks that Bṛhaspati there refers to Jupiter; but this is
<div n="lb"/>extremely improbable, though in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>17</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaspati is made the regent of Tiṣya. A reference to the
[Page1-244+ 55]
<div n="lb"/>planets is much more probable in the seven suns ({%sapta sūryāḥ%})
<div n="lb"/>of the late Taittirīya Āraṇyaka.<sup>18</sup> On the other hand, Ludwig's
<div n="lb"/>efforts to find the five planets with the sun, the moon, and the
<div n="lb"/>twenty-seven Nakṣatras (lunar mansions) in the Rigveda, as
<div n="lb"/>corresponding to the number thirty-four used in connexion with

{@Grāma.@}¦ — The primitive sense of this word, which occurs
<div n="lb"/>frequently from the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> onwards, appears to have been
<div n="lb"/>‘village.’ The Vedic Indians must have dwelt in villages which
<div n="lb"/>were scattered over the country, some close together,<sup>2</sup> some far
<div n="lb"/>apart, and were connected by roads.<sup>3</sup> The village is regularly
<div n="lb"/>contrasted with the forest ({%araṇya%}), and its animals and plants
<div n="lb"/>with those that lived or grew wild in the woods.<sup>4</sup> The villages
<div n="lb"/>contained cattle, horses, and other domestic animals, as well as
<div n="lb"/>men.<sup>5</sup> Grain was also stored in them.<sup>6</sup> In the evening the
<div n="lb"/>cattle regularly returned thither from the forest.<sup>7</sup> The villages
<div n="lb"/>were probably open, though perhaps a fort ({@Pur@}) might on
[Page1-245+ 58]
<div n="lb"/>occasion be built inside.<sup>8</sup> Presumably they consisted of
<div n="lb"/>detached houses with enclosures, but no details are to be found
<div n="lb"/>in Vedic literature. Large villages ({%mahāgrāmāḥ%}) were known.<sup>9</sup>
<div n="P"/>The relation of the villagers is difficult to ascertain with
<div n="lb"/>precision. In several passages<sup>10</sup> the word occurs with what
<div n="lb"/>appears to be the derivative sense of ‘body of men.’ This
<div n="lb"/>sense presumably started from the use of the word to denote
<div n="lb"/>the ‘village folk,’ as when {@Śaryāta Mānava@} is said in the
<div n="lb"/>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>11</sup> to have wandered about with his
<div n="lb"/>‘village’ ({%grāmeṇa%}); but, as Zimmer<sup>12</sup> observes, this restricted
<div n="lb"/>sense nowhere appears clearly in the Rigveda,<sup>13</sup> where indeed
<div n="lb"/>the ‘folk’ ({%jana%})<sup>14</sup> of the Bharatas is in one passage<sup>15</sup> called
<div n="lb"/>the ‘horde seeking cows’ ({%gavyan grāmaḥ%}). Zimmer<sup>16</sup> tends to
<div n="lb"/>regard the Grāma as a clan, and as standing midway between
<div n="lb"/>the family and the tribe ({@Viś@}). The Grāma may, however,
<div n="lb"/>perhaps be regarded more correctly<sup>17</sup> as an aggregate of several
<div n="lb"/>families, not necessarily forming a clan, but only part of a clan
<div n="lb"/>({@Viś@}), as is often the case at the present day.<sup>18</sup>
<div n="P"/>Vedic literature tells us very little about the social economy
<div n="lb"/>of the village. There is nothing to show that the community
<div n="lb"/>as such held land. What little evidence there is indicates that
<div n="lb"/>individual tenure of land was known (see {@Urvarā, Kṣetra@}), but
<div n="lb"/>this, in effect though not in law, presumably meant tenure by a
<div n="lb"/>family rather than by an individual person. The expression
[Page1-246+ 58]
<div n="lb"/>‘desirous of a village’ ({%grāma-kāma%}), which occurs frequently in
<div n="lb"/>the later Saṃhitās,<sup>19</sup> points, however, to the practice of the king's
<div n="lb"/>granting to his favourites his royal prerogatives over villages so
<div n="lb"/>far as fiscal matters were concerned. Later<sup>20</sup> the idea developed
<div n="lb"/>that the king was owner of all the land, and parallel with that
<div n="lb"/>idea the view that the holders of such grants were landlords.
<div n="lb"/>But of either idea there is no vestige in Vedic literature beyond
<div n="lb"/>the word {%grāma-kāma,%} which much more probably refers to the
<div n="lb"/>grant of regalia than to the grant of land, as Teutonic parallels
<div n="lb"/>show.<sup>21</sup> Such grants probably tended to depress the position
<div n="lb"/>of the actual cultivators, and to turn them into tenants, but
<div n="lb"/>they can hardly have had this effect to any appreciable extent
<div n="lb"/>in early times.
<div n="P"/>The village does not appear to have been a unit for legal
<div n="lb"/>purposes in early days,<sup>22</sup> and it can hardly be said to have been
<div n="lb"/>a political unit. The village no doubt, as later, included in its
<div n="lb"/>members various menials, besides the cultivating owners, and
<div n="lb"/>also the Brāhmaṇas and Kṣatriyas who might hold interest
<div n="lb"/>in it by royal grant or usage without actually cultivating land,
<div n="lb"/>such as chariot-makers ({@Ratha-kāra@}), carpenters ({@Takṣan@}),
<div n="lb"/>smiths ({@Karmāra@}), and others, but they did not presumably, in
<div n="lb"/>any sense, form part of the brotherhood.<sup>23</sup> All alike were
<div n="lb"/>politically subject to the king, and bound to render him food or
<div n="lb"/>service or other tribute, unless he had transferred his rights to
[Page1-247+ 60]
<div n="lb"/>others of the royal family or household, as was no doubt often
<div n="lb"/>the case, either in whole or part. The king's share in a village
<div n="lb"/>is referred to as early as the Atharvaveda.<sup>24</sup>
<div n="P"/>At the head of the village was the Grāma-ṇī, or ‘leader of
<div n="lb"/>the village,’ who is referred to in the Rigveda,<sup>25</sup> and often in
<div n="lb"/>the later Saṃhitās and in the Brāhmaṇas.<sup>26</sup> The exact
<div n="lb"/>meaning of the title is not certain. By Zimmer<sup>27</sup> the Grāmaṇī
<div n="lb"/>is regarded as having had military functions only, and he is
<div n="lb"/>certainly often connected with the {@Senānī,@} or ‘leader of an
<div n="lb"/>army.’ But there is no reason so to restrict the sense: pre-
<div n="lb"/>sumably the Grāmaṇī was the head of the village both for civil
<div n="lb"/>purposes and for military operations. He is ranked in the
<div n="lb"/>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>28</sup> as inferior to the {@Sūta,@} or ‘charioteer,’
<div n="lb"/>with whom, however, he is associated<sup>29</sup> as one of the {@Ratnins,@}
<div n="lb"/>the ‘jewels’ of the royal establishment. The post was especially
<div n="lb"/>valuable to a Vaiśya, who, if he attained it, was at the summit
<div n="lb"/>of prosperity ({%gataśrī%}).<sup>30</sup> The Grāmaṇī's connexion with the
<div n="lb"/>royal person seems to point to his having been a nominee of
<div n="lb"/>the king rather than a popularly elected officer. But the post
<div n="lb"/>may have been sometimes hereditary, and sometimes nomi-
<div n="lb"/>nated or elective: there is no decisive evidence available.
<div n="lb"/>The use of the singular presents difficulties: possibly the
<div n="lb"/>Grāmaṇī of the village or city where the royal residence was
<div n="lb"/>situated was specially honoured and influential.<sup>31</sup>

{@Ghṛta,@}¦ the modern Ghee or ‘clarified butter,’ is repeatedly
<div n="lb"/>mentioned in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later<sup>2</sup> both as in ordinary use
<div n="lb"/>and as a customary form of sacrifice. According to a citation
<div n="lb"/>in Sāyaṇa's commentary on the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>3</sup> the dis-
<div n="lb"/>tinction between Ghṛta and {@Sarpis@} consisted in the latter being
<div n="lb"/>butter fully melted, while the former was butter melted and
<div n="lb"/>hardened ({%ghanī-bhūta%}), but this distinction cannot be pressed.
<div n="lb"/>Because the butter was thrown into the fire, Agni is styled
<div n="lb"/>‘butter-faced’ ({%ghṛta-pratīka%}),<sup>4</sup> ‘butter-backed’ ({%ghṛta-pṛṣṭha%}),<sup>5</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and ‘propitiated with butter’ ({%ghṛta-prasatta%}),<sup>6</sup> and ‘found of
<div n="lb"/>butter’ ({%ghṛta-prī%}).<sup>7</sup> Water was used to purify the butter: the
<div n="lb"/>waters were therefore called ‘butter-cleansing’ ({%ghṛta-pū%}).<sup>8</sup> In

{@Cakra,@}¦ the ‘wheel’ of a chariot or wagon, is repeatedly
<div n="lb"/>mentioned from the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> onwards, often in a metaphorical
<div n="lb"/>sense. The wheel was fixed on the axle ({@Akṣa@}) when the
<div n="lb"/>chariot was required for use; this required considerable
<div n="lb"/>strength, as is shown by a reference in the Rigveda.<sup>2</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>wheel consisted normally of spokes ({@Ara@}), and a nave ({@Nābhi@}),<sup>3</sup>
<div n="lb"/>in the opening ({@Kha@}) of which the end of the axle ({@Āṇi@}) was
<div n="lb"/>inserted. An indication of the importance attached to the
<div n="lb"/>strength of the wheel is the celebration of the car of the god
<div n="lb"/>Pūṣan as having a wheel that suffers no damage.<sup>4</sup> The usual
<div n="lb"/>number of wheels was two,<sup>5</sup> but in seven passages of the Rigveda<sup>6</sup>
<div n="lb"/>a chariot is called ‘three-wheeled,’ in a few others ‘seven-
<div n="lb"/>wheeled,’<sup>7</sup> while in one of the Atharvaveda<sup>8</sup> it is styled ‘eight-
<div n="lb"/>wheeled.’ Zimmer<sup>9</sup> argues that these epithets do not refer to
<div n="lb"/>real chariots, pointing out that in all the passages where
<div n="lb"/>{%tri-cakra,%} ‘three-wheeled,’ occurs there is a mythical reference.
<div n="lb"/>On the other hand, Weber<sup>10</sup> thinks that there might have been
<div n="lb"/>chariots with three wheels, one being in the centre between the
<div n="lb"/>two occupants. This is not very conclusive; at any rate, the
<div n="lb"/>seven-wheeled and the eight-wheeled chariots can hardly be
<div n="lb"/>regarded as indicating the existence of real vehicles with that
<div n="lb"/>number of wheels.

<div n="lb"/>repeatedly in the Rigveda, and connected with the preparation
<div n="lb"/>of Soma. Zimmer<sup>1</sup> considers that in the dual it denotes the
<div n="lb"/>two boards between which, in his opinion, the Soma was
<div n="lb"/>crushed ({%cf.%} {@Adhiṣavaṇa@}). Roth,<sup>2</sup> however, appears to be right
<div n="lb"/>in taking the normal sense to designate a vessel into which the
<div n="lb"/>Soma was poured from the press, and Hillebrandt<sup>3</sup> shows
<div n="lb"/>clearly that when it occurs in the plural<sup>4</sup> it always has this
<div n="lb"/>sense, corresponding to the Graha-pātras of the later ritual,
<div n="lb"/>and that sometimes it is so used in the singular<sup>5</sup> or dual<sup>6</sup> also.
<div n="lb"/>In some cases,<sup>7</sup> however, he recognizes its use as denoting the
<div n="lb"/>mortar in which the Soma was pressed: he may be right here,
<div n="lb"/>as this mode of preparation was probably Indo-Iranian.<sup>8</sup>
<div n="P"/>In a derivative sense Camū appears in the Śatapatha Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa<sup>9</sup> to denote a trough, either of solid stone or consisting of
[Page1-256+ 48]
<div n="lb"/>bricks, used by the Eastern people to protect the body of the
<div n="lb"/>dead from contact with the earth, like modern stone-lined

{@Cātur-māsya,@}¦ ‘four-monthly,’ denotes the festival of the
<div n="lb"/>Vedic ritual held at the beginning of the three seasons of four
<div n="lb"/>months each, into which the Vedic year was artificially divided.<sup>1</sup>
<div n="lb"/>It is clear that the sacrifices commenced with the beginning
<div n="lb"/>of each season,<sup>2</sup> and it is certain that the first of them, the
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśvadeva, coincided with the Phālgunī full moon,<sup>3</sup> the second,
<div n="lb"/>the Varuṇa-praghāsas, with the Āṣāḍhī full moon,<sup>4</sup> and the
<div n="lb"/>third, the Sāka-medha, with the Kārttikī full moon.<sup>5</sup> There
<div n="lb"/>were, however, two alternative datings: the festivals could also
<div n="lb"/>be held in the Caitrī, the Śrāvaṇī, and Āgrahāyaṇī (Mārgaśīrṣī)
<div n="lb"/>full moons,<sup>6</sup> or in the Vaiśākhī, Bhādrapadī, and Pauṣī full
<div n="lb"/>moons.<sup>7</sup> Neither of the later datings is found in a Brāhmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>text, but each may well have been known early, since the
<div n="lb"/>Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>8</sup> and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>9</sup> both
<div n="lb"/>recognize the full moon in the month Caitra as an alternative
<div n="lb"/>to the full moon in the month Phālguna, for the beginning of
<div n="lb"/>the year.
<div n="P"/>Jacobi considers that the commencement of the year with the
<div n="lb"/>full moon in the asterism Phalgunī, which is supported by other
<div n="lb"/>evidence,<sup>10</sup> indicates that the year at one time began with the winter
<div n="lb"/>solstice with the moon in Phalgunī, corresponding to the summer
<div n="lb"/>solstice when the sun was in Phalgunī. These astronomical
<div n="lb"/>conditions, he believes, existed in the time of the Rigveda,<sup>11</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and prevailed in the fourth millennium B.C. The alternative
[Page1-260+ 51]
<div n="lb"/>dates would then indicate periods when the winter solstice
<div n="lb"/>coincided with the Caitrī or the Vaiśākhī full moon. But
<div n="lb"/>Oldenberg<sup>12</sup> and Thibaut<sup>13</sup> seem clearly right in holding that
<div n="lb"/>the coincidence of Phālgunī with the beginning of spring,<sup>14</sup>
<div n="lb"/>which is certain, is fatal to this view, and that there is no
<div n="lb"/>difficulty in regarding this date as consistent with the date of
<div n="lb"/>the winter solstice in the new moon of Māgha, which is given
<div n="lb"/>by the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa,<sup>15</sup> and which forms the basis of
<div n="lb"/>the calculations of the Jyotiṣa.<sup>16</sup> The full moon in Phālguna
<div n="lb"/>would be placed about one month and a half after the winter
<div n="lb"/>solstice, or, say, in the first week of February, which date,
<div n="lb"/>according to Thibaut, may reasonably be deemed to mark the
<div n="lb"/>beginning of a new season in India about 800 B.C. At the
<div n="lb"/>same time it must be remembered that the date was necessarily
<div n="lb"/>artificial, inasmuch as the year was divided into three seasons,
<div n="lb"/>each of four months, and the Indian year does not in fact
<div n="lb"/>consist of three equal seasons. The variations of the other
<div n="lb"/>datings would then not be unnatural if any school wished to
<div n="lb"/>defer its spring festival, the Vaiśvadeva, to the time when
<div n="lb"/>spring had really manifested itself. See also {@Saṃvatsara.@}

<div n="lb"/>making him acceptable to his wife, and a husband of maidens.
[Page1-265+ 49]
<div n="lb"/>The legend is given in another form in the Śatapatha Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa,<sup>4</sup> where Cyavana is described as wedding Sukanyā,
<div n="lb"/>the daughter of {@Śaryāta.@} He is there called a Bhṛgu or
<div n="lb"/>Āṅgirasa, and is represented as having been rejuvenated by
<div n="lb"/>immersion in a pond — the first occurrence of a motive, later
<div n="lb"/>very common in Oriental literature. Another legend about
<div n="lb"/>Cyavāna is apparently alluded to in an obscure hymn of the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda,<sup>5</sup> where he seems to be opposed to the {@Paktha@} prince
<div n="lb"/>{@Tūrvayāṇa,@} an Indra worshipper, while Cyavāna seems to
<div n="lb"/>have been specially connected with the Aśvins. This explana-
<div n="lb"/>tion of the hymn, suggested by Pischel,<sup>6</sup> is corroborated by the
<div n="lb"/>Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>7</sup> which relates that {@Vidanvant,@} another
<div n="lb"/>son of Bhṛgu, supported Cyavana against Indra, who was
<div n="lb"/>angry with him for sacrificing to the Aśvins; it is also note-
<div n="lb"/>worthy that the Aśvins appear in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>8</sup> as
<div n="lb"/>obtaining a share in the sacrifice on the suggestion of Sukanyā.
<div n="lb"/>But a reconciliation of Indra and Cyavana must have taken
<div n="lb"/>place, because the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>9</sup> relates the inauguration
<div n="lb"/>of {@Śāryāta@} by Cyavana with the great Indra consecration
<div n="lb"/>({%aindreṇa mahābhiṣekeṇa%}). In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇā<sup>10</sup>

<L>1004<pc>1-269<k1>jana<k2>jana
{@Jana,@}¦ besides meaning ‘man’ as an individual, with a
<div n="lb"/>tendency to the collective sense, commonly denotes a ‘people’
<div n="lb"/>or ‘tribe’ in the Rigveda and later. Thus, the ‘five tribes’
<div n="lb"/>({@Panca Janāḥ@} or {@Janāsaḥ@}) are frequently referred to, and in
<div n="lb"/>one hymn of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> the ‘people of Yadu’ ({%yādva jana%})
<div n="lb"/>and the {@Yadus@} ({%yādvāḥ%}) are synonymous. Again, the king
<div n="lb"/>({%rājan%}) is described as ‘protector ({%gopā%}) of the people ({%janasya%}),’<sup>2</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and there are other references to king and Jana.<sup>3</sup> The people
<div n="lb"/>of the {@Bharatas@} ({%bhārata jana%}) is also mentioned;<sup>4</sup> there is no
<div n="lb"/>ground to assume with Hopkins<sup>5</sup> that Jana in this case means
<div n="lb"/>a clan or horde ({@Grāma@}), as distinguished from a people.
<div n="P"/>It is difficult to say exactly how a people was divided.
<div n="lb"/>Zimmer<sup>6</sup> argues from a passage in the Rigveda<sup>7</sup> that a people
<div n="lb"/>was divided into cantons ({@Viś@}), cantons into joint families or
<div n="lb"/>clans, or village communities ({@Grāma, Vṛjana@}), and these again
<div n="lb"/>into single families. He thinks that the four divisions are
<div n="lb"/>reflected in the passage in question. by Jana, Viś, Janman, and
<div n="lb"/>Putrāḥ, or sons, and argues that each village community was
<div n="lb"/>originally founded on relationship. But it is very doubtful
<div n="lb"/>whether this precise division of the people can be pressed. The
<div n="lb"/>division of the Jana into several Viś may be regarded as
<div n="lb"/>probable, for it is supported by the evidence of another passage
<div n="lb"/>of the Rigveda,<sup>8</sup> which mentions the Viś as a unit of the fighting
<div n="lb"/>men, and thus shows that, as in Homeric times and in ancient
<div n="lb"/>Germany, relationship was deemed a good principle of military
<div n="lb"/>arrangement. But the subdivision of the Viś into several
<div n="lb"/>Grāmas is very doubtful. Zimmer<sup>9</sup> admits that neither Grāma<sup>10</sup>
[Page1-270+ 47]
<div n="lb"/>nor {@Vṛjana@}<sup>11</sup> has the special sense of a subdivision of the Viś
<div n="lb"/>when used for war, for both words only denote generally an
<div n="lb"/>armed host. He finds other designations of the village host in
<div n="lb"/>{@Vrā@}<sup>12</sup> and in {@Vrāja,@}<sup>13</sup> but it is sufficient to say that the former
<div n="lb"/>passage is of extremely doubtful import,<sup>14</sup> and that the latter
<div n="lb"/>has no reference to war at all. It is therefore impossible to state
<div n="lb"/>in what exact relation the Grāma in Vedic times stood to the
<div n="lb"/>Viś or to the family (Kula or Gotra). The confusion is increased
<div n="lb"/>by the vagueness of the sense of both Grāma and Viś. If the
<div n="lb"/>latter be regarded as a local division, then no doubt the Grāma
<div n="lb"/>must have been a part of a district; but if a Viś was a unit of
<div n="lb"/>relationship, then a Grāma may have contained families of
<div n="lb"/>different Viśes, or may have sometimes coincided with a
<div n="lb"/>Viś, or have contained only a part of a Viś. But in any
<div n="lb"/>case the original state of affairs must have been greatly
<div n="lb"/>modified by the rise of the system of caste, and the substitu-
<div n="lb"/>tion of a hierarchical for a political point of view. The
<div n="lb"/>elements of the people were represented by the family — either
<div n="lb"/>as an individual family inhabiting one home ({@Kula@}), and con-
<div n="lb"/>sisting often, no doubt, of a joint family of brothers, or as a
<div n="lb"/>patriarchal family of sons who still lived with their father — and
<div n="lb"/>by the clan, the later {@Gotra,@} which included all those who
<div n="lb"/>claimed a common ancestor. The Gotra may be regarded as
<div n="lb"/>roughly corresponding to the Latin {%gens%} and the Greek <lang n="greek"></lang>,
<div n="lb"/>and possibly the Viś may be the equivalent of the {%curia%} and
<lang n="greek"></lang>, and the Jana of the {%tribus%} and <lang n="greek"></lang> or <lang n="greek"></lang>.<sup>15</sup> These
<div n="lb"/>three divisions may also be seen in the Viś, Zantu, and Daqyu
<div n="lb"/>of the Iranian world, where the use of Viś suggests that in the
<div n="lb"/>Indian Viś a relationship based on blood rather than locality is
<div n="lb"/>meant — and perhaps even in the {%vicus, pagus,%} and {%civitas%} of the
<div n="lb"/>old German polity described in the Germania<sup>16</sup> of Tacitus.
<div n="lb"/>The family in some form appears as the third element of the
<div n="lb"/>Jana in a passage of the Rigveda,<sup>17</sup> where the house ({%gṛha%}) is
[Page1-271+ 44]
<div n="lb"/>contrasted with the Jana and the Viś. Possibly, too, another
<div n="lb"/>passage<sup>18</sup> contrasts the {%adhvara,%} or family sacrifice, with that of
<div n="lb"/>the Jana or Viś, rather than, as Zimmer<sup>19</sup> thinks, the village
<div n="lb"/>with the two larger units. But it is significant of the particu-
<div n="lb"/>larism of the Vedic Indians that while the king maintained a
<div n="lb"/>fire which might be regarded as the sacred fire of the tribe,
<div n="lb"/>there is no sure trace<sup>20</sup> of any intermediate cult between that of
<div n="lb"/>the king and that of the individual householder. The real
<div n="lb"/>elements in the state are the Gotra and the Jana, just as
<div n="lb"/>ultimately the {%gens%} and {%tribus,%} the <lang n="greek"></lang> and <lang n="greek"></lang> are alone
<div n="lb"/>important. It may be that Viś sometimes represents in the
<div n="lb"/>older texts what later was known as the Gotra. See {@Viś.@}
<div n="P"/>This appears clearly when the constitution of society in the
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa period is considered. The tribe or people still exists,
<div n="lb"/>and is presupposed, but the division into Viś disappears. The
<div n="lb"/>real division is now the separate castes ({@Varṇa@}), but the
<div n="lb"/>numerous sections into which each of them is divided appear to
<div n="lb"/>be based in part on the ancient Gotra.

{@Janaka,@}¦ king of Videha, plays a considerable part in the
<div n="lb"/>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> and the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad,<sup>2</sup>
<div n="lb"/>as well as in the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup> and the Kauṣītaki
<div n="lb"/>Upaniṣad.<sup>4</sup> He was a contemporary of {@Yājñavalkya Vāja-@}
[Page1-272+ 50]
<div n="lb"/>{@saneya,@}<sup>5</sup> of {@Śvetaketu Āruṇeya,@} and of other sages.<sup>6</sup> He had
<div n="lb"/>become famous for his generosity and his interest in the dis-
<div n="lb"/>cussion of the nature of Brahman, as ultimate basis of reality,
<div n="lb"/>in the life-time of {@Ajātaśatru@} of Kāśi.<sup>7</sup> It is significant that
<div n="lb"/>he maintained a close intercourse with the Brahmins of the
<div n="lb"/>Kuru-Pañcālas, such as Yājñavalkya and Śvetaketu; for this
<div n="lb"/>indicates that the home of the philosophy of the Upaniṣads
<div n="lb"/>was in the Kuru-Pañcāla country rather than in the east.
<div n="lb"/>There is a statement in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>8</sup> that he
<div n="lb"/>became a Brahmin ({%brahmā%}). This does not, however, signify
<div n="lb"/>a change of caste, but merely that in knowledge he became
<div n="lb"/>a Brahmin (see {@Kṣatriya@}). Janaka is occasionally mentioned
<div n="lb"/>in later texts: in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>9</sup> he has already
<div n="lb"/>become quite mythical; in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra<sup>10</sup>
<div n="lb"/>a {%sapta-rātra%} or seven nights' rite is ascribed to him.
<div n="P"/>It is natural to attempt to date Janaka by his being a con-
<div n="lb"/>temporary of Ajātaśatru, and by identifying the latter with the
<div n="lb"/>Ajātasattu of the Pāli texts:<sup>11</sup> this would make the end of the
<div n="lb"/>sixth century B.C. the approximate date of Janaka.<sup>12</sup> But it is
<div n="lb"/>very doubtful whether this identification can be supported:
<div n="lb"/>Ajātaśatru was king of Kāśi, whereas Ajātasattu was king of
<div n="lb"/>Magadha, and his only connexion with Kāśi was through his
<div n="lb"/>marriage with the daughter of Pasenadi of Kosala.<sup>13</sup> More-
<div n="lb"/>over, the acceptance of this chronology would be difficult to
<div n="lb"/>reconcile with the history of the development of thought; for
<div n="lb"/>it would make the rise of Buddhism contemporaneous with the
<div n="lb"/>Upaniṣads, whereas it is reasonably certain that the older
<div n="lb"/>Upaniṣads preceded Buddhism.<sup>14</sup> Nor do the Vedic texts know
<div n="lb"/>anything of Bimbisāra or Pasenadi, or any of the other princes
<div n="lb"/>famed in Buddhist records.
[Page1-273+ 54]
<div n="P"/>The identification<sup>15</sup> of Janaka of Videha and the father of
<div n="lb"/>Sītā is less open to objection, but it cannot be proved, and is
<div n="lb"/>somewhat doubtful. In the Sūtras Janaka appears as an
<div n="lb"/>ancient king who knew of a time when wifely honour was less
<div n="lb"/>respected than later.<sup>16</sup>

<L>1095<pc>1-294<k1>takman<k2>takman
{@Takman@}¦ is a disease repeatedly mentioned in the Athar-
<div n="lb"/>vaveda, but later not known under this name. It is the subject
<div n="lb"/>of five hymns<sup>1</sup> of the Atharvaveda, and is often mentioned else-
<div n="lb"/>where.<sup>2</sup> Weber<sup>3</sup> first identified it with ‘fever,’ and Grohmann<sup>4</sup>
<div n="lb"/>showed that all the symptoms pointed to that ailment.<sup>5</sup> Refer-
<div n="lb"/>ence is made to the alternate hot and shivering fits of the
<div n="lb"/>patient,<sup>6</sup> to the yellow colour of the jaundice which accompanies
<div n="lb"/>the fever,<sup>7</sup> and to its peculiar periodicity. The words used to
<div n="lb"/>describe its varieties are {%anye-dyuḥ,%}<sup>8</sup> {%ubhaya-dyuḥ,%}<sup>9</sup> {%tṛtīyaka,%}<sup>10</sup>
<div n="lb"/>{%vi-tṛtīya,%}<sup>11</sup> and {%sadaṃ-di,%}<sup>12</sup> the exact sense of most of which
<div n="lb"/>terms is somewhat uncertain. It is agreed<sup>13</sup> that the first
<div n="lb"/>epithet designates the fever known as {%quotidianus,%} which recurs
<div n="lb"/>each day at the same hour, though the word is curious (lit.
[Page1-295+ 54]
<div n="lb"/>‘on the other — {%i.e.,%} next, day’). The {%ubhaya-dyuḥ%} (‘on both
<div n="lb"/>days’) variety appears to mean a disease recurring for two suc-
<div n="lb"/>cessive days, the third being free; this corresponds to the {%rhythmus%}
<div n="lb"/>{%quartanus complicatus.%}<sup>14</sup> But Sāyaṇa considers that it means a
<div n="lb"/>fever recurring on the third day, the ‘tertian.’ The {%tṛtīyaka,%}
<div n="lb"/>however, must be the ‘tertian’ fever,<sup>15</sup> though Zimmer<sup>16</sup> suggests
<div n="lb"/>that it may mean a fever which is fatal at the third paroxysm.
<div n="lb"/>Grohmann<sup>17</sup> regards the {%vi-tṛtīyaka%} as equivalent to the {%tertiana%}
<div n="lb"/>{%duplicata,%} a common form in southern countries, in which the
<div n="lb"/>fever occurs daily, but with a correspondence in point of time
<div n="lb"/>or severity of attack on alternate days. Bloomfield<sup>18</sup> suggests
<div n="lb"/>that it is identical with the {%ubhaya-dyuḥ%} variety. The {%sadaṃ-di%}<sup>19</sup>
<div n="lb"/>type appears to be the kind later known as {%saṃtata-jvara%}
<div n="lb"/>(‘continuous fever’), in which there are attacks of several days’
<div n="lb"/>duration, with an interval followed by a fresh period of attack.
<div n="lb"/>Fever occurred at different seasons, in the autumn ({%śārada%}), in
<div n="lb"/>the hot weather ({%graiṣma%}), in the rains ({%vārṣika%}),<sup>20</sup> but was
<div n="lb"/>especially prevalent in the first, as is indicated by the epithet
<div n="lb"/>{%viśva-śārada,%} ‘occurring every autumn.’<sup>21</sup>
<div n="P"/>The disease is said to arise when Agni enters the waters.<sup>22</sup>
<div n="lb"/>From this Weber<sup>23</sup> deduced that it was considered to be the
<div n="lb"/>result of a chill supervening on heat, or the influence of heat on
<div n="lb"/>marshy land. Grohmann<sup>24</sup> preferred to see in this connexion
<div n="lb"/>of the origin of the disease with Agni's entering the waters<sup>25</sup>
<div n="lb"/>an allusion to the fact that fever arises in the rainy season, the
<div n="lb"/>time when Agni, as lightning, descends to earth with the rain.
<div n="lb"/>Zimmer.<sup>26</sup> who accepts this view, further refers to the prevalence
[Page1-296+ 41]
<div n="lb"/>of fever in the Terai, and interprets {%vanya,%} an epithet of fever
<div n="lb"/>found in the Atharvaveda,<sup>27</sup> as meaning ‘sprung from the
<div n="lb"/>forest,’ pointing out that fever is mentioned as prevalent among
<div n="lb"/>the {@Mūjavants@} and {@Mahāvṛṣas,@} two mountain tribes of the
<div n="lb"/>western Himālaya.<sup>28</sup> There is no trace of fever having been
<div n="lb"/>observed to be caused by the bite of the {%anopheles%} mosquito,
<div n="lb"/>which breeds in stagnant water: this theory has without reason
<div n="lb"/>been held to be known to classical Indian medicine.<sup>29</sup>
<div n="P"/>Among the symptoms of Takman, or among complications
<div n="lb"/>accompanying it, are mentioned ‘itch’ ({@Pāman@}), ‘headache’
<div n="lb"/>({%śīrṣa-śoka%}),<sup>30</sup> ‘cough’ ({@Kāsikā@}), and ‘consumption,’ or perhaps
<div n="lb"/>some form of itch ({@Balāsa@}).
<div n="P"/>It is perhaps significant that the Takman does not appear
<div n="lb"/>until the Atharvaveda. It is quite possible that the Vedic
<div n="lb"/>Āryans, when first settled in India, did not know the disease,
<div n="lb"/>which would take some generations to become endemic and
<div n="lb"/>recognized as dangerous. What remedies they used against it
<div n="lb"/>is quite uncertain, for the Atharvaveda mentions only spells
<div n="lb"/>and the {@Kuṣṭha,@} which can hardly have been an effective
<div n="lb"/>remedy, though still used in later times. Fever must, even in
<div n="lb"/>the Atharvan period, have claimed many victims, or it would
<div n="lb"/>not be mentioned so prominently.

<div n="lb"/>alluded to as a stealer of clothes ({%vastra-mathi%})<sup>14</sup> and as a
<div n="lb"/>debtor.<sup>15</sup> In one passage the Tāyus are said to disappear at
<div n="lb"/>the coming of dawn (which is elsewhere called {%yāvayad-dveṣas,%}
<div n="lb"/>‘driving away hostile beings,’ and {%ṛta-pā,%} ‘guardian of order’),

<div n="lb"/>({%taskara%}), pickpockets ({%stāyu%}), stealers ({%muṣṇant%}), and cutters
<div n="lb"/>({%vi-kṛnta%}); and designations of sharpers ({%gṛtsa%}) and bands
<div n="lb"/>({%gaṇa, vrāta%}), apparently of robbers, are mentioned.<sup>18</sup> It is
<div n="lb"/>therefore not surprising that the Rigveda<sup>19</sup> should contain
<div n="lb"/>many prayers for safety at home or on the way, or that
<div n="lb"/>the Atharvaveda should devote several hymns to night<sup>20</sup>
<div n="lb"/>chiefly for protection against the evil doings of thieves and
<div n="lb"/>robbers.
<div n="P"/>Pischel<sup>21</sup> suggests that in one passage of the Rigveda<sup>22</sup>
<div n="lb"/>{@Vasiṣṭha@} is represented as a burglar, but the admits that, since
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha was attacking the house of his father Varuṇa, he was
<div n="lb"/>only seeking to obtain what he may have regarded as his own.
<div n="lb"/>But the interpretation of the hymn is not certain.<sup>23</sup>
<div n="P"/>Sāyaṇa's explanation of one passage of the Rigveda,<sup>24</sup> as
[Page1-304+ 60]
<div n="lb"/>referring to professional cattle-trackers, like the Khojis of the
<div n="lb"/>Panjab, seems quite probable.<sup>25</sup>
<div n="P"/>The punishment of thieves appears primarily to have been
<div n="lb"/>left to the action of the robbed. The practice of binding them
<div n="lb"/>in stocks<sup>26</sup> seems clearly referred to. But later, at any rate — 
<div n="lb"/>and in all probability earlier also, as in other countries — a more
<div n="lb"/>severe penalty could be exacted, and death inflicted by the
<div n="lb"/>king.<sup>27</sup> There is no hint in Vedic literature of the mode of
<div n="lb"/>conviction; a fire ordeal is not known to the Atharvaveda,<sup>28</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and the ordeal known to the Chāndogya Upaniṣad<sup>29</sup> is not said
<div n="lb"/>to be used in the case of theft. No doubt the stolen property
<div n="lb"/>was recovered by the person robbed if he could obtain it.
<div n="lb"/>Nothing is known as to what happened if the property had

{@Tirindira@}¦ is mentioned in a Dānastuti, or ‘Praise of Gifts,’
<div n="lb"/>in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> as having, along with {@Parśu,@} bestowed gifts
<div n="lb"/>on the singer. In the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra<sup>2</sup> this state-
<div n="lb"/>ment is represented by a tale that the Kaṇva Vatsa obtained
<div n="lb"/>a gift from Tirindira Pāraśavya, Tirindira and Parśu being
<div n="lb"/>in this version thus treated as one and the same man.
<div n="lb"/>Ludwig<sup>3</sup> sees in the Rigvedic passage a proof that the Yadus
<div n="lb"/>had gained a victory over Tirindira, and gave a part of the
<div n="lb"/>booty to the singers; but there is no proof whatever of the
<div n="lb"/>correctness of this interpretation, which Zimmer<sup>4</sup> shows to be
<div n="lb"/>most unlikely. Yadu princes must be meant by Tirindira and
[Page1-311+ 57]
<div n="lb"/>Parśu, though Weber<sup>5</sup> thinks that the singers were Yadus, not
<div n="lb"/>the princes. The latter he holds to have been Iranian ({%cf.%}

{@Turvaśa@}¦ occurs frequently in the Rigveda as the name of
<div n="lb"/>a man or of a people, usually in connexion with {@Yadu.@} The
<div n="lb"/>two words usually occur in the singular without any connecting
<div n="lb"/>particle, {%Turvaśa Yadu%} or {%Yadu Turvaśa.%}<sup>2</sup> In a plural form
<div n="lb"/>the name Turvaśa occurs once with the Yadus,<sup>3</sup> and once
<div n="lb"/>alone<sup>4</sup> in a hymn in which the singular has already been used.
<div n="lb"/>In one passage<sup>5</sup> the dual {%Turvaśā-Yadū%} actually occurs, and
<div n="lb"/>in another<sup>6</sup> {%Yadus Turvaś ca,%} ‘Yadu and Turva.’ In other
<div n="lb"/>passages<sup>7</sup> Turvaśa appears alone, while in one<sup>8</sup> Turvaśa and
<div n="lb"/>Yādva occur.
<div n="P"/>From these facts Hopkins<sup>9</sup> deduces the erroneousness of the
<div n="lb"/>ordinary view,<sup>10</sup> according to which Turvaśa is the name of
<div n="lb"/>a tribe, the singular denoting the king, and regards Turvaśa
<div n="lb"/>as the name of the Yadu king. But the evidence for this is
<div n="lb"/>not conclusive. Without laying any stress on the argument
<div n="lb"/>based on the theory<sup>11</sup> that the ‘five peoples’ of the Rigveda
<div n="lb"/>are the {@Anus, Druhyus,@} Turvaśas, Yadus, and {@Pūrus,@} it is
<div n="lb"/>perfectly reasonable to hold that the Turvaśas and Yadus were
<div n="lb"/>two distinct though closely allied tribes. Such they evidently
<div n="lb"/>were to the seers of the hymns which mention in the dual the
<div n="lb"/>{%Turvaśā-Yadū%} and speak of {%Yadus Turvaś ca.%} This explanation
<div n="lb"/>also suits best the use of the plural of Turvaśa in two Rigvedic
<div n="lb"/>hymns.
<div n="P"/>In the Rigveda the chief exploit of Turvaśa was his partici-
<div n="lb"/>pation in the war against {@Sudās,@} by whom he was defeated.<sup>12</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Hopkins<sup>13</sup> suggests that he may have been named Turvaśa
<div n="lb"/>because of his fleet ({%tura%}) escape from the battle. His escape

<div n="lb"/>45, 27; x. 49, 8. In vii. 18, 6, Turvaśa
<div n="lb"/>is joined with Yakṣu, apparently a con-
<div n="lb"/>temptuous variant of Yadu (Hopkins,
<div n="lb"/>{%Journal of the American Oriental Society,%}
<div n="lb"/>15, 261). {%Cf.%} {@Tṛtsu.@}
[Page1-316+ 54]
<div n="lb"/>may have been assisted by Indra, for in some passages<sup>14</sup> Indra's
<div n="lb"/>aid to Turvaśa (and) Yadu is referred to; it is also significant
<div n="lb"/>that the Anu, and apparently the Druhyu, kings are mentioned
<div n="lb"/>as having been drowned in the defeat, but not the Turvaśa
<div n="lb"/>and Yadu kings, and that Turvaśa appears in the eighth book
<div n="lb"/>of the Rigveda as a worshipper of Indra with the Anu prince,
<div n="lb"/>the successor, presumably, of the one who was drowned.<sup>15</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Griffith,<sup>16</sup> however, proposes to refer these passages to a defeat
<div n="lb"/>by Turvaśa and Yadu of Arṇa and Citraratha on the {@Sarayu;@}<sup>17</sup>
<div n="lb"/>but the evidence for this is quite inadequate.
<div n="P"/>Two passages of the Rigveda<sup>18</sup> seem to refer to an attack by
<div n="lb"/>Turvaśa and Yadu on {@Divodāsa,@} the father of Sudās. It is
<div n="lb"/>reasonable to suppose that this was an attack of the two
<div n="lb"/>peoples on Divodāsa, for there is some improbability of the
<div n="lb"/>references being to the Turvaśa, who was concerned in the
<div n="lb"/>attack on Sudās, the son.
<div n="P"/>Zimmer<sup>19</sup> considers that the Turvaśas were also called {@Vṛcī-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@vants.@} This view is based on a hymn<sup>20</sup> in which reference
<div n="lb"/>is made to the defeat of the Vṛcīvants on the {@Yavyāvatī@} and
<div n="lb"/>{@Hariyūpīyā@} in aid of Daivarāta, and of Turvaśa in aid of
<div n="lb"/>{@Sṛñjaya,@} the latter being elsewhere<sup>21</sup> clearly the son of Deva-
<div n="lb"/>rāta. But as this evidence for the identification of the Turvaśas
<div n="lb"/>with the Vṛcīvants is not clear, it seems sufficient<sup>22</sup> to assume
<div n="lb"/>that they were allies.
<div n="P"/>Later, in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>23</sup> the Turvaśas appear
<div n="lb"/>as allies of the Pañcālas, Taurvaśa horses, thirty-three in
<div n="lb"/>number, and armed men, to the number of 6,000, being
<div n="lb"/>mentioned.<sup>24</sup> But otherwise the name disappears: this lends
[Page1-317+ 47]
<div n="lb"/>probability to Oldenberge's conjecture<sup>25</sup> that the Turvaśas
<div n="lb"/>became merged in the {@Pañcāla@} people. Hopkins<sup>26</sup> considers
<div n="lb"/>that in the Śatapatha passage the horses were merely named
<div n="lb"/>from the family of Turvaśa; but this view is less likely, since
<div n="lb"/>it ignores the difficulty involved in the reference to the men.
<div n="P"/>It is impossible to be certain regarding the home of the
<div n="lb"/>Turvaśas at the time of their conflict with Sudās. They
<div n="lb"/>apparently crossed the {@Paruṣṇī,@}<sup>27</sup> but from which side is dis-
<div n="lb"/>puted. The view of Pischel<sup>28</sup> and Geldner,<sup>29</sup> that they advanced
<div n="lb"/>from the west towards the east, where the {@Bharatas@} were (see

{@Tṛtsu@}¦ occurs in the Rigveda, once in the singular<sup>1</sup> and several

<div n="lb"/>{@Bhalānas, Alinas, Viṣāṇins, Śivas, Ajas, Śigrus,@} and perhaps
<div n="lb"/>Yakṣus.<sup>4</sup> The defeat of the ten kings is celebrated in one
[Page1-321+ 56]
<div n="lb"/>hymn of the Rigveda,<sup>5</sup> and is evidently alluded to in two
<div n="lb"/>others.<sup>6</sup> The great battle took place on the {@Paruṣṇī,@} but there
<div n="lb"/>was also a fight on the {@Yamunā@} with Bheda, the Ajas, Śigrus,
<div n="lb"/>and Yakṣus. As the Yamunā and the Parusṇī represent
<div n="lb"/>opposite ends of the territory of the Tṛtsus (for we cannot
<div n="lb"/>with Hopkins<sup>7</sup> safely identify the streams), it is difficult to see
<div n="lb"/>exactly how the ten kings could be confederated, but it should
<div n="lb"/>be noted that the references to the ten kings occur in the two
<div n="lb"/>later hymns,<sup>6</sup> and not in the hymn<sup>5</sup> describing the battle itself;
<div n="lb"/>besides, absolute numerical accuracy cannot be insisted upon.
<div n="P"/>It is difficult exactly to determine the character of the
<div n="lb"/>Tṛtsus; especially in their relation to the Bharatas, who under
<div n="lb"/>Viśvāmitra's guidance are represented as prospering and as
<div n="lb"/>advancing to the {@Vipāś@} and {@Śutudrī.@}<sup>8</sup> Roth ingeniously
<div n="lb"/>brought this into connexion with the defeat of his enemies
<div n="lb"/>by Sudās, which is celebrated in the seventh book of the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda — a book attributed to the Vasiṣṭha family — and thought
<div n="lb"/>that there was a reference in one verse<sup>9</sup> to the defeat of the
<div n="lb"/>Bharatas by Sudās. But it seems certain that the verse is
<div n="lb"/>mistranslated, and that the Bharatas are really represented as
<div n="lb"/>victors with Sudās.<sup>10</sup> Ludwig<sup>11</sup> accordingly identifies the
<div n="lb"/>Tṛtsus and the Bharatas. Oldenberg,<sup>12</sup> after accepting this
<div n="lb"/>view at first,<sup>13</sup> later expressed the opinion that the Tṛtsus were
<div n="lb"/>the priests of the Bharata people, and therefore identical with
<div n="lb"/>the Vasiṣṭhas. This view is supported by the fact that in one
<div n="lb"/>passage<sup>14</sup> the Tṛtsus are clearly described as wearing their
<div n="lb"/>hair in the peculiar manner affected by the Vasiṣṭhas,<sup>15</sup> and
<div n="lb"/>would in that passage thus seem to represent the Vasiṣṭhas.
[Page1-322+ 59]
<div n="lb"/>But Geldner<sup>16</sup> has suggested with great probability that Tṛtsu,
<div n="lb"/>who is once mentioned in the singular,<sup>17</sup> means the Tṛtsu
<div n="lb"/>king — that is, Sudās.<sup>18</sup> This explanation alone justifies the
<div n="lb"/>description<sup>19</sup> of the Bharatas as {%Tṛtsūnāṃ viśaḥ,%}<sup>20</sup> ‘subjects of
<div n="lb"/>the Tṛtsus,’ meaning the Tṛtsu Gotra or family, for the people
<div n="lb"/>could not be said to be subjects of a body of priests. The
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭhas might be called Tṛtsus because of their close con-
<div n="lb"/>nexion with the royal house of that people. The reverse
<div n="lb"/>process is also quite possible, but is rendered improbable by
<div n="lb"/>the fact that the {@Pratṛdaḥ@} are referred to as receiving Vasiṣṭha.<sup>21</sup>
<div n="lb"/>This name of the Tṛtsu dynasty is probably older than its
<div n="lb"/>connexion with Vasiṣṭha in the time of Sudās, a conclusion
<div n="lb"/>supported by the name of {@Pratardana,@} who is mentioned later
<div n="lb"/>as a descendant of Divodāsa,<sup>22</sup> an ancestor of Sudās. The
<div n="lb"/>Tṛtsu dynasty could therefore hardly have been referred to as
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭhas. For the further history of the dynasty and its
<div n="lb"/>relation with Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra, see {@Sudās.@}
<div n="P"/>If the Tṛtsus and their subjects, the Bharatas, were in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigvedic period at war with the tribes on either side of the
<div n="lb"/>territory between the Paruṣṇī and the Yamunā, it is clear<sup>23</sup>
<div n="lb"/>that later on they coalesced with the Pūrus and probably
<div n="lb"/>others of those tribes to form the {@Kuru@} people. Already in
<div n="lb"/>the Rigveda<sup>24</sup> the Tṛtsus are allied with the {@Sṛñjayas,@} and in
<div n="lb"/>the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>25</sup> one Purohita serves both Kurus
<div n="lb"/>and Sṛñjayas.
[Page1-323+ 50]
<div n="P"/>Hillebrandt<sup>26</sup> considers that the Tṛtsus cannot be identified
<div n="lb"/>with the Bharatas, but that Sudās and the Bharatas represent
<div n="lb"/>an invading body, which, however, became allied with the
<div n="lb"/>Tṛtsus and the Vasiṣṭha priests. He also thinks that the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda reveals a time when {@Divodāsa,@} the grandfather or
<div n="lb"/>ancestor of Sudās, was living in Arachosia, on the {@Sarasvatī,@}
<div n="lb"/>and warring against the {@Paṇis,@} whom he identifies with the
<div n="lb"/>Parnians. But this conjecture<sup>27</sup> cannot be regarded as
<div n="lb"/>probable. In the Sarasvatī<sup>28</sup> it is not necessary to see any
<div n="lb"/>other river than the later Sarasvatī, in the middle country,
<div n="lb"/>which flowed within the boundaries of the Tṛtsus: it is also
<div n="lb"/>significant that there are references<sup>29</sup> to contests between
<div n="lb"/>{@Turvaśa Yadu@} and Atithigva or Divodāsa. Thus there is no
<div n="lb"/>reason to doubt that Divodāsa and the Bharatas were in the
<div n="lb"/>middle country, and not in Iran.

<div n="lb"/>which Hopkins, {%op. cit.,%} 260, has over-
<div n="lb"/>looked), and there is no doubt that
<div n="lb"/>the later opinion is correct. {%Cf.%} also
<div n="lb"/>Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda,
<div n="lb"/>3, 173; Hopkins, 260, 261. Of these
<div n="lb"/>tribes the Pakthas, Alinas, Bhalānas,
<div n="lb"/>Viṣāṇins, and Śivas, were probably
<div n="lb"/>settled in the north-west, to the west
<div n="lb"/>of the Indus, and around the Kabul
<div n="lb"/>River. The Anus, Pūrus, Turvaśas,
<div n="lb"/>Yadus, and Druhyus, were probably
<div n="lb"/>tribes of the Panjab; the Ajas, Śigrus,
<div n="lb"/>and Yakṣus, tribes of the east, under
<div n="lb"/>Bheda; Śambara may also have been
<div n="lb"/>a native of the east; Śimyu and Kavaṣa
<div n="lb"/>are doubtful; and the Vaikarṇau prob-
<div n="lb"/>ably belonged to the north-west.</F>
<F>4) This is uncertain; the text of the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda, vii. 18, 6, has Yakṣu, and
<div n="lb"/>the same word recurs in verse 19. On
<div n="lb"/>the other hand, the word Yadu would
<div n="lb"/>naturally be expected in verse 6, as Tur-
<div n="lb"/>vaśa is mentioned. Zimmer, {%Altindisches%}
<div n="lb"/>{%Leben,%} 122, says that Yadu occurs in
<div n="lb"/>vii. 18, but on p. 126 he cites Yakṣu
<div n="lb"/>in both places, evidently by oversight.
<div n="lb"/>Hopkins, {%Journal of the American Oriental%}
<div n="lb"/>{%Society,%} 15, 261, n., considers that Tur-
<div n="lb"/>vaśa, the Yakṣu, is a sarcastic expres-
<div n="lb"/>sion, instead of Turvaśa, the Yadu,
<div n="lb"/>making Turvaśa, whom he regards as
<div n="lb"/>king of the Yadus, ridiculous as a
<div n="lb"/>member of an insignificant people, and
<div n="lb"/>alluding to him also as a sacrificial
<div n="lb"/>victim (as it were, {%yaṣṭavya,%} ‘to be
<div n="lb"/>offered’; {%of puroḍāś,%} ‘cake of sacrifice,’
<div n="lb"/>in verse 6, as a pun on {%purogās,%} ‘leader’).
<div n="lb"/>Whether Yakṣu is used contemptuously
<div n="lb"/>for Yadu or not, it seems hard not to

<L>1206<pc>1-327<k1>trasadasyu<k2>trasadasyu
{@Trasa-dasyu,@}¦ son of {@Purukutsa,@}<sup>1</sup> is mentioned in the Rigveda
<div n="lb"/>as king of the Pūrus.<sup>2</sup> He was born to Purukutsa by his wife,
<div n="lb"/>{@Purukutsānī,@} at a time of great distress;<sup>3</sup> this, according to
<div n="lb"/>Sāyaṇa, refers to Purukutsa's captivity: possibly his death is
<div n="lb"/>really meant. Trasadasyu was also a descendant of Girikṣit,<sup>4</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and Purukutsa was a descendant of Durgaha. The genealogy,
<div n="lb"/>therefore, appears to be: Durgaha, Girikṣit, Purukutsa, Trasa-
<div n="lb"/>dasyu. Trasadasyu was the ancestor of {@Tṛkṣi,@}<sup>5</sup> and, according
<div n="lb"/>to Ludwig,<sup>6</sup> had a son Hiraṇin. Trasadasyu's chronological
<div n="lb"/>position is determined by the fact that his father, Purukutsa,
<div n="lb"/>was a contemporary of Sudās, either as an opponent<sup>7</sup> or as
<div n="lb"/>a friend.<sup>8</sup> That Purukutsa was an enemy of Sudās is more
<div n="lb"/>probable, because the latter's predecessor, Divodāsa, was
<div n="lb"/>apparently<sup>9</sup> at enmity with the Pūrus, and in the battle of the
<div n="lb"/>ten kings Pūrus were ranged against Sudās and the Tṛtsus.
<div n="lb"/>Trasadasyu himself seems to have been an energetic king.
<div n="lb"/>His people, the Pūrus, were settled on the {@Sarasvatī,@}<sup>10</sup> which
<div n="lb"/>was, no doubt, the stream in the middle country, that locality
<div n="lb"/>according well with the later union of the Pūrus with the
<div n="lb"/>{@Kuru@} people, who inhabited that country. This union is
<div n="lb"/>exemplified in the person of {@Kuruśravaṇa,@} who is called
<div n="lb"/>Trāsadasyava, ‘descendant of Trasadasyu,’ in the Rigveda,<sup>11</sup>
<div n="lb"/>whose father was {@Mitrātithi,@} and whose son was {@Upamaśravas.@}
<div n="lb"/>The relation of Mitrātithi to Tṛkṣi does not appear.
<div n="P"/>Another descendant of Trasadasyu was {@Tryaruṇa Traivṛṣṇa,@}
<div n="lb"/>who is simply called Trasadasyu in a hymn of the Rigveda.<sup>12</sup>
[Page1-328+ 50]
<div n="lb"/>He was not only a ‘descendant of Trivṛṣan,’ but, according
<div n="lb"/>to the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>13</sup> he was also Traidhātva,
<div n="lb"/>‘descendant of Tridhātu.’ The order of these two predecessors
<div n="lb"/>of Tryaruṇa cannot be determined in any way from Vedic
<div n="lb"/>literature. According to the later tradition,<sup>14</sup> a prince named
<div n="lb"/>Tridhanvan preceded Tryaruṇa in the succession. Vedic tradi-
<div n="lb"/>tion further fails to show in what precise relation Trasadasyu
<div n="lb"/>stood to Trivṛṣan or Tryaruṇa.
<div n="P"/>Trasdasyu Paurukutsa appears in several Brāhmaṇas<sup>15</sup> as a
<div n="lb"/>famous sacrificer of ancient times, together with {@Para Āṭṇāra,@}

<div n="lb"/>or domestic priest, {@Vṛśa Jāna,@} and by excessive speed in driving
<div n="lb"/>killed a Brahmin boy. This sin was atoned for by the Puro-
<div n="lb"/>hita's using his Vārśa Sāman (chant). The Śāṭyāyana Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa, cited by Sāyaṇa,<sup>3</sup> elaborates the tale. As Vṛśa had
<div n="lb"/>held the reins, king and priest accused each other of the murder.
<div n="lb"/>The Ikṣvākus being consulted threw the responsibility for the
<div n="lb"/>crime on Vṛśa, who thereupon revived the boy by the Vārśa
<div n="lb"/>Sāman. In consequence of this unfairness of theirs — being
<div n="lb"/>Kṣatriyas they were partial to a Kṣatriya — Agni's glow ceased
<div n="lb"/>to burn in their houses. In response to their appeal to restore
<div n="lb"/>it, Vṛśa came to them, saw the Piśācī (demoness), who, in the
<div n="lb"/>form of Trasadasyu's wife, had stolen the glow, and succeeded
<div n="lb"/>in restoring it to Agni. This version with some variations
<div n="lb"/>occurs also in the Bṛhaddevatā,<sup>4</sup> which connects the story with
<div n="lb"/>a hymn of the Rigveda.<sup>5</sup> Sieg's attempt<sup>6</sup> to show that the

[Page1-333+ 44]

<div n="lb"/>of the patronymics, Traivṛṣṇa and Traidhātva, by which he is
<div n="lb"/>referred to can best be explained by assuming that there were
<div n="lb"/>two kings, Trivṛṣan and Tridhātu (or possibly Tridhanvan),

{@Daśan,@}¦ ‘ten,’ forms the basis of the numerical system of the
<div n="lb"/>Vedic Indians, as it does of the Āryan people generally. But
<div n="lb"/>it is characteristic of India<sup>1</sup> that there should be found at a
<div n="lb"/>very early period long series of names for very high numerals,
<div n="lb"/>whereas the Āryan knowledge did not go beyond 1,000. In
<div n="lb"/>the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>2</sup> the list is 1; 10; 100; 1,000; 10,000
<div n="lb"/>({%ayuta%}); 100,000 ({%niyuta%}); 1,000,000 ({%prayuta%}); 10,000,000 ({%arbuda%});
<div n="lb"/>100,000,000 ({%nyarbuda%}); 1,000,000,000 ({%samudra%}); 10,000,000,000
<div n="lb"/>({%madhya%}); 100,000,000,000 ({%anta%}); 1,000,000,000,000 ({%parārdha%}).
<div n="lb"/>In the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>3</sup> the list is the same, but {%niyuta%} and
<div n="lb"/>{%prayuta%} exchange places, and after {%nyarbuda%} a new figure
<div n="lb"/>({%badva%}) intervenes, thus increasing {%samudra%} to 10,000,000,000,
<div n="lb"/>and so on. The Taittirīya Saṃhitā has in two places<sup>4</sup> exactly
<div n="lb"/>the same list as the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā. The Maitrāyaṇī
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitā<sup>5</sup> has the list {%ayuta, prayuta,%} then {%ayuta%} again, {%arbuda,%}
<div n="lb"/>{%nyarbuda, samudra, madhya, anta, parārdha.%} The Pañcaviṃśa
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa<sup>6</sup> has the Vājasaneyi list up to {%nyarbuda%} inclusive,
<div n="lb"/>then follow {%nikharvaka, badva, akṣita,%} and apparently {%go%} =
<div n="lb"/>1,000,000,000,000. The Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa<sup>7</sup> list
[Page1-343+ 58]
<div n="lb"/>replaces {%nikharvaka%} by {%nikharva, badva%} by {%padma,%} and ends
<div n="lb"/>with {%akṣitir vyomāntaḥ.%} The Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra<sup>8</sup> con-
<div n="lb"/>tinues the series after {%nyarbuda%} with {%nikharvāda, samudra,%}
<div n="lb"/>{%salila, antya, ananta%} (= 10 billions).
<div n="P"/>But beyond {%ayuta%}<sup>9</sup> none of these numbers has any vitality.
<div n="lb"/>{%Badva,%} indeed, occurs in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>10</sup> but it
<div n="lb"/>cannot there have any precise numerical sense;<sup>11</sup> and later on
<div n="lb"/>the names of these high numerals are very much confused.
<div n="P"/>An arithmetical progression of some interest is found in the
<div n="lb"/>Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>12</sup> where occurs a list of sacrificial gifts
<div n="lb"/>in which each successive figure doubles the amount of the
<div n="lb"/>preceding one. It begins with {%dvādaśa-mānaṃ hiraṇyam,%} ‘gold
<div n="lb"/>to the value of 12’ (the unit being uncertain, but probably the
<div n="lb"/>{@Kṛṣṇala@}),<sup>13</sup> followed by ‘to the value of 24, 48, 96, 192, 384,
<div n="lb"/>768, 1,536, 3072,’ then {%dve aṣṭāviṃśati-śata-māne,%} which must
<div n="lb"/>mean 2×128×24 (the last unit being not a single {%māna,%} but
<div n="lb"/>a number of 24 {%mānas%}) = 6,144, then 12,288, 24,576, 49,152,
<div n="lb"/>98,304, 196,608, 393, 216. With these large numbers may be
<div n="lb"/>compared the minute theoretical subdivision of time found
<div n="lb"/>in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>14</sup> where a day is divided into
<div n="lb"/>15 {%muhūrtas%} — 1 {%muhūrta%} = 15 {%kṣipras,%} 1 {%kṣipra%} = 15 {%etarhis,%}

{@Dasyu,@}¦ a word of somewhat doubtful origin, is in many
<div n="lb"/>passages of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> clearly applied to superhuman
<div n="lb"/>enemies. On the other hand, there are several passages in
<div n="lb"/>which human foes, probably the aborigines, are thus designated.
<div n="lb"/>This may be regarded as certain in those passages where the
<div n="lb"/>Dasyu is opposed to the Āryan, who defeats him with the aid
<div n="lb"/>of the gods.<sup>2</sup> The great difference between the Dasyus and
<div n="lb"/>the Āryans was their religion: the former are styled ‘not
<div n="lb"/>sacrificing,’ ‘devoid of rites,’ ‘addicted to strange vows,’ ‘god-
<div n="lb"/>hating,’ and so forth.<sup>3</sup> As compared with the {@Dāsa,@} they are
<div n="lb"/>less distinctively a people: no clans ({%viśaḥ%}) of the Dasyus are
<div n="lb"/>mentioned, and while Indra's {%dasyu-hatya,%} ‘slaughter of the
<div n="lb"/>Dasyus,’ is often spoken of, there is no corresponding use of
<div n="lb"/>{%dāsa-hatya.%} That the Dasyus were real people is, however,
<div n="lb"/>shown by the epithet {%anās%} applied to them in one passage of the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda.<sup>5</sup> The sense of this word is not absolutely certain: the
<div n="lb"/>Pada text and Sāyaṇa both take it to mean ‘without face’ ({%an-ās%}),<sup>6</sup>
<div n="lb"/>but the other rendering, ‘noseles’ ({%a-nās%}), is quite possible,<sup>7</sup>
<div n="P"/>4 Rv. i. 51, 5, 6; 103, 4; x. 95, 7;
<div n="lb"/>99, 7; 105, 11. {%Cf. dasyu-han.%} ‘Dasyu-
<div n="lb"/>slaying,’ i. 100, 12; vi. 45, 24; viii. 76,
<div n="lb"/>11; 77, 3; x. 47, 4 (all of Indra);
<div n="lb"/>vi. 16, 15; viii. 39, 8 (of Agni), etc.
[Page1-348+ 68]
<div n="lb"/>and would accord well with the flat-nosed aborigines of the
<div n="lb"/>Dravidian<sup>8</sup> type, whose language still persists among the Brahuis,
<div n="lb"/>who are found in the north-west. This interpretation would
<div n="lb"/>receive some support from Vṛtra's being called ‘broken-nosed’
<div n="lb"/>if this were a correct explanation of the obscure word {%rujānās.%}<sup>9</sup>
<div n="P"/>The other epithet of the Dasyus is {%mṛdhra-vāc,%} which
<div n="lb"/>occurs with {%anās,%}<sup>10</sup> and which has been rendered<sup>11</sup> ‘of stam-
<div n="lb"/>mering, or unintelligible speech.’ This version is by no
<div n="lb"/>means certain, and since the epithet is elsewhere<sup>12</sup> applied
<div n="lb"/>to Āryans, its correct meaning is more probably ‘of hostile
<div n="lb"/>speech.’
<div n="P"/>Dasyu corresponds with the Iranian {%daṅhu, daqyu,%} which
<div n="lb"/>denotes a ‘province.’ Zimmer<sup>13</sup> thinks that the original
<div n="lb"/>meaning was ‘enemy,’ whence the Iranians developed the
<div n="lb"/>sense of ‘hostile country,’ ‘conquered country,’ ‘province,’
<div n="lb"/>while the Indians, retaining the signification of ‘enemy,’ ex-
<div n="lb"/>tended it to include demon foes. Roth<sup>14</sup> considers that the
<div n="lb"/>meaning of human enemy is a transfer from the strife of gods
[Page1-349+ 59]
<div n="lb"/>and demons. Lassen<sup>15</sup> attempted to connect the contrast
<div n="lb"/>{%daqyu: dasyu%} with that of {%daeva: deva,%} and to see in it a result
<div n="lb"/>of the religious differences which, according to Haug's theory,
<div n="lb"/>had separated the Iranians and the Indians. The word may
<div n="lb"/>have originally meant ‘ravaged land’<sup>16</sup> as a result of invasion;
<div n="lb"/>hence ‘enemies’ country,' then ‘hostile people,’ who as human
<div n="lb"/>foes were more usually called by the cognate name of {@Dāsa.@}
<div n="P"/>Individual Dasyus are {@Cumuri, Śambara, Śuṣṇa,@} etc.
<div n="P"/>In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>17</sup> the word has, as later,<sup>18</sup> the
<div n="lb"/>sense of uncivilized peoples generally.

<div n="lb"/>supports this view. But Hillebrandt,
<div n="lb"/>{%op. cit.,%} 1, 89, 90, 114, prefers to see in

{@Dāya@}¦ occurs in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> only in the sense of ‘reward’
<div n="lb"/>of exertion ({%śrama%}), but later it means ‘inheritance’ — that is,
<div n="lb"/>a father's property which is to be divided among his sons
<div n="lb"/>either during his lifetime or after his death. The passages all
<div n="lb"/>negative the idea that the property of the family was legally
<div n="lb"/>family property: it is clear that it was the property of the head
<div n="lb"/>of the house, usually the father, and that the other members
<div n="lb"/>of the family only had moral claims upon it which the father
<div n="lb"/>could ignore, though he might be coerced by his sons if they
<div n="lb"/>were physically stronger.
<div n="P"/>Thus {@Manu@} is said in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>2</sup> to have divided
<div n="lb"/>his property among his sons. He omitted {@Nābhānediṣṭha,@}
[Page1-352+ 66]
<div n="lb"/>whom he afterwards taught how to appease the Aṅgirases, and
<div n="lb"/>to procure cows. This is a significant indication that the
<div n="lb"/>property he divided was movable property, rather than land
<div n="lb"/>({@Urvarā@}). In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup> the division is said to
<div n="lb"/>have been made during Manu's lifetime by his sons, who left
<div n="lb"/>only their aged father to Nābhānediṣṭha. According to the
<div n="lb"/>Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>4</sup> again, four sons divided the inheritance
<div n="lb"/>while their old father, Abhipratārin, was still alive. It is,
<div n="lb"/>of course, possible to regard Dāya as denoting the heritable
<div n="lb"/>property of the family, but the developed {%patria potestas%} of the
<div n="lb"/>father, which was early very marked, as shown by the legend
<div n="lb"/>of {@Śunaḥśepa,@} is inconsistent with the view that the sons
<div n="lb"/>were legally owners with their father, unless and until. they
<div n="lb"/>actually insisted on a division of the property.<sup>5</sup> Probably — 
<div n="lb"/>there is no evidence of any decisive character — land was not
<div n="lb"/>divided at first, but no doubt its disposal began to follow the
<div n="lb"/>analogy of cattle and other movable property as soon as the
<div n="lb"/>available supply of arable land became limited.
<div n="P"/>As for the method of division, it is clear from the Taittirīya
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitā<sup>6</sup> that the elder son was usually preferred; perhaps
[Page1-353+ 50]
<div n="lb"/>this was always the case after death. During the father's life-
<div n="lb"/>time another might be preferred, as appears from a passage
<div n="lb"/>of the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.<sup>7</sup> Women were excluded from
<div n="lb"/>partition or inheritance, according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>8</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and the Nirukta.<sup>9</sup> They were, no doubt, supported by their
<div n="lb"/>brothers; but if they had none they might be reduced to prosti-
<div n="lb"/>tution.<sup>10</sup> Detailed rules of inheritance appear in the Sūtras.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="P"/>The heir is called Dayada,<sup>12</sup> ‘receiver ({%ā-da%}) of inheritance.’

<div n="lb"/>to show that there was such a power,
<div n="lb"/>and that the father owned the property.
<div n="lb"/>His sons, as they grew up, came to

<div n="lb"/>as having forts ({%puraḥ%}),<sup>3</sup> and their clans ({%viśaḥ%}) are mentioned.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="lb"/>It is possible that the forts, which are called ‘autumnal’
<div n="lb"/>({%śaradīḥ%}),<sup>5</sup> may be mythical, but it is not essential, for the
<div n="lb"/>epithet may allude to their being resorted to in the autumn
<div n="lb"/>season. The Dāsa colour ({@Varṇa@})<sup>6</sup> is probably an allusion to
<div n="lb"/>the black skin of the aborigines, which is also directly men-
<div n="lb"/>tioned.<sup>7</sup> The aborigines (as Dasyus) are called {%anās,%} ‘nose-
<div n="lb"/>less’(?),<sup>8</sup> and {%mṛdhra-vāc,%} ‘of hostile speech,’<sup>9</sup> and are probably
<div n="lb"/>meant by the phallus-worshippers ({%śiśna-devāḥ,%} ‘whose deity
<div n="lb"/>is a phallus’) of the Rigveda.<sup>10</sup> It is significant that constant
[Page1-357+ 67]
<div n="lb"/>reference is made to the differences in religion between Ārva
<div n="lb"/>and Dāsa or Dasyu.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="P"/>Since the Dāsas were in many cases reduced to slavery, the
<div n="lb"/>word Dāsa has the sense of ‘slave’ in several passages of the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda.<sup>12</sup> Dāsī, the feminine, always has this sense from
<div n="lb"/>the Atharvaveda<sup>13</sup> onwards. Aboriginal women were, no doubt,
<div n="lb"/>the usual slaves, for on their husbands being slain in battle
<div n="lb"/>they would naturally have been taken as servants. They would
<div n="lb"/>sometimes also become concubines; thus {@Kavaṣa@} was taunted
<div n="lb"/>with being the son of a female slave ({%dāsyāḥ putraḥ%}) in the
<div n="lb"/>Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>14</sup>
<div n="P"/>Ludwig<sup>15</sup> considers that in some passages<sup>16</sup> Dāsa is applied,
<div n="lb"/>in the sense of ‘enemy,’ to Āryan foes, but this is uncertain.
<div n="lb"/>Zimmer<sup>17</sup> and Meyer<sup>18</sup> think that Dāsa<sup>19</sup> originally meant
<div n="lb"/>‘enemy’ in general, later developing in Iran into the name of
<div n="lb"/>the Dahae<sup>20</sup> of the Caspian steppes, and in India into a desig-
<div n="lb"/>nation of the aborigines. On the other hand, Hillebrandt<sup>21</sup>
<div n="lb"/>argues that, as the Dāsas and the Paṇis are mentioned together,<sup>22</sup>
<div n="lb"/>they must be deemed to be closely related tribes, identifying
[Page1-358+ 51]
<div n="lb"/>the Paṇis with the Parnians and the Dāsas of the Rigveda
<div n="lb"/>with the Dahae. This view, of course, necessitates a transfer
<div n="lb"/>of the scenes of the Rigveda, where Dāsas are prominent, and
<div n="lb"/>especially those in which Divodāsa — ‘the heavenly Dāsa’ — plays
<div n="lb"/>an important part,<sup>23</sup> to the far west. Hillebrandt justifies this
<div n="lb"/>by regarding the scene of the sixth book of the Rigveda as
<div n="lb"/>quite different from that of the seventh and third, in which
<div n="lb"/>Sudās, the Bharatas, Vasiṣṭha, and Viśvāmitra appear. The
<div n="lb"/>Sarasvatī of the sixth book he locates in Arachosia, that of the
<div n="lb"/>seventh in the ‘Middle Country.’ It is, however, extremely
<div n="lb"/>doubtful whether this theory can be upheld. That Divodāsa
<div n="lb"/>should have been a Dāsa, and yet have fought against other
<div n="lb"/>Dāsas, is not in itself likely, especially when his son Sudās
<div n="lb"/>appears as a protagonist of Āryan civilization. It also seems
<div n="lb"/>unreasonable to seek in Arachosia for the river {@Sarasvati,@}
<div n="lb"/>which it is natural to locate in the ‘Middle Country.’
<div n="P"/>The wealth of the Dāsas was no doubt considerable,<sup>24</sup> but in
<div n="lb"/>civilization there is no reason to suppose that they were ever
<div n="lb"/>equal to the invaders.<sup>25</sup> Leading Dāsas were {@Ilībiśa, Cumuri@}

{@Div,@}¦ ‘sky.’ The world as a whole is regarded as divided
<div n="lb"/>into the three domains of ‘earth,’ ‘air’ or ‘atmosphere,’ and
<div n="lb"/>‘heaven’ or ‘sky’ ({%div%}),<sup>1</sup> or alternatively into ‘heaven and
<div n="lb"/>earth’ ({%dyāvā-pṛthivī%}),<sup>2</sup> which two are then considered as com-
<div n="lb"/>prising the universe, the atmosphere being included in the sky.
<div n="lb"/>Lightning, wind, and rain belong to the atmosphere, solar and
[Page1-361+ 56]
<div n="lb"/>similar phenomena to the sky. In some passages<sup>3</sup> the vault
<div n="lb"/>({%nāka%}) of the sky is added after the usual triad, and before the
<div n="lb"/>celestial light ({%svar, jyotis%}).
<div n="P"/>The threefold division of the universe is reflected in a three-
<div n="lb"/>fold division of the three elements — earth, air, and sky. Thus
<div n="lb"/>a highest ({%uttama,%}<sup>4</sup> {%uttara,%}<sup>5</sup> {%pārya%}<sup>6</sup> ), a middle, and a lowest
<div n="lb"/>heaven are specified.<sup>4</sup> In the Atharvaveda<sup>7</sup> the three heavens
<div n="lb"/>are distinguished as ‘rich in water’ ({%udanvatī%}), as {%pīlumatī%} (of
<div n="lb"/>uncertain meaning), and as the {%pradyaus,%} where the Fathers sit.
<div n="lb"/>Heaven is frequently called {%vyoman%} as well as {%rocana%}<sup>8</sup> (properly
<div n="lb"/>the ‘luminous space’ of heaven), and the dividing firmament
<div n="lb"/>which separates the visible upper world from the highest
<div n="lb"/>heaven is called, besides {%nāka,%} ‘vault,’ {%sānu,%} ‘summit,’ {%viṣṭap,%}
<div n="lb"/>‘surface,’ and {%pṛṣṭha,%} ‘ridge,’ and even ‘ridge of the vault,’<sup>9</sup> or
<div n="lb"/>‘summit of the vault.’<sup>10</sup>
<div n="P"/>Similarly three atmospheres ({%rajas%}), or oftener two, are
<div n="lb"/>alluded to,<sup>11</sup> but the division here is merely artificial. In one
<div n="lb"/>passage<sup>12</sup> six {%rajāṃsi,%} ‘regions,’ are referred to, the heavens
<div n="lb"/>and the earths no doubt being meant. The usual name for the
<div n="lb"/>atmosphere is {%antarikṣa.%}
<div n="P"/>The three earths are equally artificial, the origin of the triad
<div n="lb"/>being probably the use of {%pṛthivī%} in the plural<sup>13</sup> to denote the
<div n="lb"/>three divisions of the universe (just as {%pitarau,%} ‘two fathers,’
<div n="lb"/>denotes ‘father and mother’).<sup>14</sup> The earth is called {%kṣam, kṣā,%}
<div n="lb"/>{%gmā,%} or designated by the epithets {%mahī,%} ‘the great,’ {%pṛthivī%} or
<div n="lb"/>{%urvī,%} ‘the broad,’ {%uttānā,%} ‘the extended,’ and is regularly con-
<div n="lb"/>trasted as {%idam,%} ‘this world here,’ with the upper sphere.<sup>15</sup>
[Page1-362+ 59]
<div n="lb"/>The shape of the earth is compared with a wheel in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda,<sup>16</sup> and is expressly called ‘circular’ ({%pari-maṇḍala%}) in
<div n="lb"/>the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>17</sup> When earth is conjoined with
<div n="lb"/>heaven, the two are conceived as great bowls ({%camvā%}) turned
<div n="lb"/>towards each other.<sup>18</sup> In the Aitareya Āraṇyaka<sup>19</sup> the two are
<div n="lb"/>regarded as halves of an egg. The distance of heaven from
<div n="lb"/>the earth is given by the Atharvaveda<sup>20</sup> as a thousand days'
<div n="lb"/>journey for the sun-bird, by the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>21</sup> as a
<div n="lb"/>thousand days' journey for a horse, while the Pañcaviṃśa
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa<sup>22</sup> whimsically estimates the distance as equivalent
<div n="lb"/>to a thousand cows standing one on the top of the other.
<div n="P"/>According to Zimmer,<sup>23</sup> the Vedic poets conceived the
<div n="lb"/>atmosphere to be above the earth in its upper division only,
<div n="lb"/>but below it in its lower stratum. The evidence,<sup>24</sup> however, for
<div n="lb"/>the latter assumption is quite insufficient.<sup>25</sup> The theory of
<div n="lb"/>the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>26</sup> is that the sun merely reverses its
<div n="lb"/>bright side at night, turning its light on the stars and the moon
<div n="lb"/>while it retraverses its course to the east; and it has been
<div n="lb"/>shown<sup>25</sup> that this is probably the doctrine of the Rigveda also.<sup>27</sup>

{@Divodāsa Atithigva@}¦ is one of the leading princes of the
<div n="lb"/>early Vedic age. He was a son of Vadhryaśva,<sup>1</sup> and father,
<div n="lb"/>or more probably grandfather, of {@Sudās,@} the famous king of the
<div n="lb"/>{@Tṛtsu@} family, among the {@Bharatas.@} Probably Pijavana was
<div n="lb"/>the son and Sudās the grandson. Divodāsa was naturally a
<div n="lb"/>{@Bharata,@}<sup>2</sup> and, like Sudās, was an opponent of the {@Turvaśas@}
<div n="lb"/>and {@Yadus.@}<sup>3</sup> His great enemy was {@Śambara,@} the {@Dāsa,@} who
<div n="lb"/>was apparently chief of a mountain people,<sup>4</sup> and whom he
<div n="lb"/>repeatedly defeated.<sup>5</sup> He was also, it seems, like his father
<div n="lb"/>Vadhryaśva,<sup>6</sup> an energetic supporter of the fire ritual, for Agni
<div n="lb"/>is once called by his name in the Rigveda.<sup>7</sup> On the other hand,
<div n="lb"/>he was defeated, with {@Āyu@} and {@Kutsa,@} by Indra's aid. In

<div n="lb"/>clusion is not probable, for the {@Sarasvatī@} on which the battle
<div n="lb"/>in question took place, and which can hardly be the Haraqaiti
<div n="lb"/>of Arachosia, would naturally designate the later Sarasvatī,

{@Devāpi Ārṣṭiṣeṇa@}¦ (‘descendant of Ṛṣṭiṣeṇa’) is mentioned
<div n="lb"/>in a hymn of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and in the Nirukta.<sup>2</sup> According to
<div n="lb"/>the latter source there were two brothers, {@Devāpi@} and {@Śantanu,@}
<div n="lb"/>princes of the Kurus. The elder was Devāpi, but Śantanu got
<div n="lb"/>himself anointed king, whereupon no rain fell for twelve years.
<div n="lb"/>The drought being attributed by the Brahmins to his having
<div n="lb"/>superseded his elder brother, Śantanu offered the kingdom to
<div n="lb"/>Devāpi. The latter, however, refused, but acting as Purohita,
<div n="lb"/>or domestic priest, for his brother, obtained rain. The Bṛhad-
<div n="lb"/>devatā<sup>3</sup> tells much the same tale, but adds that the reason for
<div n="lb"/>Devāpi's exclusion from the throne was the fact that he suffered
<div n="lb"/>from a skin disease. The Epic and later legends further
[Page1-378+ 54]
<div n="lb"/>develop the story, presenting two somewhat discrepant accounts.
<div n="lb"/>According to the one version,<sup>4</sup> the ground of Devāpi's being
<div n="lb"/>passed over was leprosy, while in the other his devoting
<div n="lb"/>himself to asceticism in his youth was the cause of his brother's
<div n="lb"/>taking his place. The Epic,<sup>5</sup> moreover, treats him as a son of
<div n="lb"/>Pratīpa, and names as his brothers Bāhlīka<sup>6</sup> and Āṛṣṭiṣeṇa,<sup>7</sup>
<div n="lb"/>who is a new figure developed from the patronymic of Devāpi
<div n="lb"/>Possibly Sieg<sup>8</sup> is right in holding that two stories, those of
<div n="lb"/>Devāpi, Pratīpa's son, and of Devāpi, Ṛṣṭiṣeṇa's son, have been
<div n="lb"/>confused; but in any case it is impossible to extract history
<div n="lb"/>from them.<sup>9</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Rigvedic hymn certainly appears to represent Devāpi
<div n="lb"/>as sacrificing for Śantanu, who seems to be called {@Aulāna.@}<sup>10</sup>
<div n="lb"/>But there is no trace in it of the brotherhood of the two men,
<div n="lb"/>nor is there anything to show that Devāpi was not a Brahmin,
<div n="lb"/>but a Kṣatriya. Sieg,<sup>11</sup> who interprets the hymn by the
<div n="lb"/>Nirukta, thinks that he was a Kṣatriya, but on this occasion
<div n="lb"/>was enabled by the favour of Bṛhaspati to officiate as priest,
<div n="lb"/>and that the hymn shows clear recognition of the unusual
<div n="lb"/>character of his action; but this view seems very improbable.

{@Dharma,@}¦<sup>1</sup> {@Dharman,@}<sup>2</sup> are the regular words, the latter in the

<div n="lb"/>very little evidence in the early literature as to the administra-
<div n="lb"/>tion of justice or the code of law followed. On the other hand,
<div n="lb"/>the Dharma Sūtras<sup>3</sup> contain full particulars.
<div n="P"/>(1) {%Criminal Law.%} — The crimes recognized in Vedic litera-
<div n="lb"/>ture vary greatly in importance, while there is no distinction
<div n="lb"/>adopted in principle between real crimes and what now are
<div n="lb"/>regarded as fanciful bodily defects or infringements of merely
[Page1-391+ 80]
<div n="lb"/>conventional practices.<sup>4</sup> The crimes enumerated include the
<div n="lb"/>slaying of an embryo ({%bhrūṇa%}),<sup>5</sup> the slaying of a man ({%vīra%}),<sup>6</sup> and
<div n="lb"/> the slaying of a Brahmin,<sup>7</sup> a much more serious crime.
<div n="lb"/>Treachery is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>8</sup> as being
<div n="lb"/>punishable by death, as it was punished later.<sup>9</sup> But there is no
<div n="lb"/>trace of an organized criminal justice vested either in the
<div n="lb"/>king or in the people. There still seems to have prevailed the
<div n="lb"/>system of wergeld ({@Vaira@}), which indicates that criminal justice
<div n="lb"/>remained in the hands of those who were wronged. In the
<div n="lb"/>Sūtras,<sup>10</sup> on the other hand, the king's peace is recognized as
<div n="lb"/>infringed by crimes, a penalty being paid to him, or, according
<div n="lb"/>to the Brahminical textbooks, to the Brahmins. It may there-
[Page1-392+ 54]
<div n="lb"/>fore reasonably be conjectured that the royal power of jurisdic-
<div n="lb"/>tion steadily increased; the references in the Śatapatha
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa to the king as wielding punishment ({@Daṇḍa@}) confirm
<div n="lb"/>this supposition. Whether, as the analogy of other systems
<div n="lb"/>suggests, the king was assisted in his judicial duties, as he
<div n="lb"/>undoubtedly was later, by assessors, presumably of the Brahmin
<div n="lb"/>caste, cannot be made out clearly.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="P"/>The procedure adopted in deciding cases is quite uncertain.
<div n="lb"/>In the Chāndogya Upaniṣad<sup>12</sup> the ordeal of the red-hot axe is
<div n="lb"/>mentioned as applied in an accusation of theft. It must
<div n="lb"/>apparently be understood to have been inflicted by the direction
<div n="lb"/>of the king. But no other judicial ordeal is known to Vedic
<div n="lb"/>literature (see {@Divya@}). The punishment of theft was in some
<div n="lb"/>cases at least death, probably when the thief was taken red-
<div n="lb"/>handed;<sup>13</sup> in other cases binding to posts was the penalty,<sup>14</sup>
<div n="lb"/>presumably accompanied by the return of the stolen goods. In
<div n="lb"/>the Chāndogya Upaniṣad<sup>15</sup> the list of sins given as apparently
<div n="lb"/>equal in wickedness is stealing gold, drinking spirits, defiling a
<div n="lb"/>Guru's bed, and the murder of a Brahmin.
<div n="P"/>(2) {%Civil Law.%} — There is little recorded as to civil law in
<div n="lb"/>Vedic literature. The relations of the family and the question
<div n="lb"/>of family property are dealt with under {@Urvarā, Kṣetra, Pati;@}
<div n="lb"/>succession and partition of property are treated under {@Dāya.@}
<div n="lb"/>As regards the transfer of chattels — for land as transferable
<div n="lb"/>{%inter vivos%} is hardly yet recognized, save exceptionally as a
<div n="lb"/>sacrificial fee ({@Dakṣiṇā@}), and then disapproved<sup>16</sup> — the recognized
<div n="lb"/>modes are gift ({@Dāna@}) and barter or sale ({@Kraya@}), which includes
<div n="lb"/>exchange. Original acquisition of land was no doubt brought

<div n="lb"/>about by occupation and apportionment among the tribesmen,<sup>17</sup>
<div n="lb"/>while chattels were acquired by taking possession of them,
<div n="lb"/>provided that they were found on one's own land or on
<div n="lb"/>unoccupied land, and did not belong to any other person
<div n="lb"/>originally. The Sūtras<sup>18</sup> contain rules for the disposal of lost
<div n="lb"/>property, which tend to give it to the king, with the deduction
<div n="lb"/>of a percentage for the finder, unless the latter is a Brahmin,
<div n="lb"/>who keeps it all. As for contract, save in regard to money-
<div n="lb"/>lending (for which see {@Ṛṇa@}), practically nothing is to be gathered
<div n="lb"/>from Vedic literature, doubtless because of the primitive
<div n="lb"/>conditions prevailing in that early period. Much of the labour,
<div n="lb"/>which would in a more developed society have been done by
<div n="lb"/>workers for hire, would be performed by slaves ({%cf.%} {@Dāsa,@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Śūdra@}), while the technical workers of the village — of whom
<div n="lb"/>long lists are given in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>19</sup> and the
<div n="lb"/>Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>20</sup> — may have been recompensed not by
<div n="lb"/>any sum based on each piece of work done, but by fixed allow-
<div n="lb"/>ances, much as the village servants are in modern times.<sup>21</sup> But
<div n="lb"/>this must remain a matter of conjecture, and it is uncertain
<div n="lb"/>what exact status the carpenter or smith held in the village.
<div n="lb"/>Similarly it is impossible to trace in the early literature any
<div n="lb"/>legal theory or practice as to torts, but rules as to penalties for
<div n="lb"/>insults appear in the Sūtras.<sup>22</sup>
<div n="P"/>Very little is recorded as to procedure. The list<sup>23</sup> of victims
<div n="lb"/>at the Puruṣamedha, or ‘horse sacrifice,’ includes a {%praśnin,%}
<div n="lb"/>an {%abhi-praśnin,%} and a {%praśna-vivāka,%} in whom it is not un-
<div n="lb"/>reasonable to see the plaintiff, the defendant, and the arbitrator
<div n="lb"/>or judge: the terms may refer to what is probably an early
[Page1-394+ 59]
<div n="lb"/>form of judicial procedure, a voluntary arbitration. The same
<div n="lb"/>idea may be conveyed by the word {%madhyama-śī,%} ‘lying in the
<div n="lb"/>midst,’ which occurs in the Rigveda,<sup>24</sup> and which Roth,<sup>25</sup>
<div n="lb"/>followed by Zimmer,<sup>26</sup> understood to mean an arbitrator or
<div n="lb"/>judge, the expression being derived from the judge acting with
<div n="lb"/>other judicial persons,<sup>27</sup> and being surrounded by the assembly
<div n="lb"/>of the people. But this interpretation is uncertain; Whitney<sup>28</sup>
<div n="lb"/>thinks that the word merely alludes to a chief round whom
<div n="lb"/>his men encamp. The king is later the chief civil judge, and
<div n="lb"/>may presumably have been so earlier, no doubt in conjunction
<div n="lb"/>with the elders of the tribe, but for this we are reduced to
<div n="lb"/>conjecture.<sup>29</sup>
<div n="P"/>The use of witnesses as evidence is uncertain (see {@Jñātṛ@}),
<div n="lb"/>and the ordeal is not recorded as deciding any civil matter
<div n="lb"/>except the dispute between {@Vatsa@} and his rival as to the true
<div n="lb"/>Brahminical descent of the former, which was settled by his
<div n="lb"/>walking unharmed through the flame of a fire.<sup>30</sup> But it is
<div n="lb"/>probable on analogy that the ordeal may have been used for
<div n="lb"/>the purpose of deciding disputes. Whether the oath was
<div n="lb"/>so used cannot be certainly shown. It appears, however, that
<div n="lb"/>a Brahmin was preferred in legal matters to a non-Brahmin.<sup>31</sup>
<div n="P"/>There are very few references to police officials: no doubt
<div n="lb"/>the king employed some of his dependents to execute sentences
<div n="lb"/>and arrest offenders (see {@Ugra, Jīvagṛbh@}).
<div n="P"/>(3) {%Morality.%} — It is convenient to notice under this head
[Page1-395+ 61]
<div n="lb"/>several points bearing on the moral condition of the people:
<div n="lb"/>({%a%}) the exposure of children; ({%b%}) the exposure of the aged;
<div n="lb"/>({%c%}) prostitution; ({%d%}) adultery; ({%e%}) incest.
<div n="P"/>({%a%}) The exposure of girl infants is asserted by Zimmer<sup>32</sup> on
<div n="lb"/>the strength of a passage in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā,<sup>33</sup> but it
<div n="lb"/>seems clear that the passage has been misunderstood,<sup>34</sup> and
<div n="lb"/>that it refers merely to laying the child aside, not exposing it,
<div n="lb"/>while a boy was lifted up. It is, however, true that the birth
<div n="lb"/>of a girl was not at all popular, not an unnatural sentiment in
<div n="lb"/>an early society, and paralleled among other Āryan peoples.<sup>35</sup>
<div n="P"/>({%b%}) The exposure of the aged is also inferred by Zimmer<sup>36</sup>
<div n="lb"/>from a passage of the Rigveda,<sup>37</sup> and from the mention of
<div n="lb"/>persons exposed ({%ud-hitāḥ%}) in the Atharvaveda.<sup>38</sup> The latter
<div n="lb"/>passage may well refer merely to the bodies being exposed
<div n="lb"/>after death to the elements (as is done by the Parsis). The
<div n="lb"/>former passage merely refers to the individual case of some
<div n="lb"/>person who may have been cast out, and proves absolutely
<div n="lb"/>nothing as to a habitual or recognized custom, nor can such a
<div n="lb"/>custom be inferred from, {%e.g.,%} the legend of {@Cyavāna.@}
<div n="P"/>({%c%}) That prostitution existed in Rigvedic times is certain,
<div n="lb"/>but its extent is disputed. Brotherless girls were frequently
<div n="lb"/>reduced to becoming prostitutes;<sup>39</sup> the putting away of an
<div n="lb"/>illegitimate child is referred to in the Rigveda;<sup>40</sup> besides the
[Page1-396+ 61]
<div n="lb"/>terms {%puṃścalī%}<sup>41</sup> and {%mahānagnī,%}<sup>42</sup> which undoubtedly mean
<div n="lb"/>‘harlot,’ there are other clear references to prostitution;<sup>43</sup> and
<div n="lb"/>expressions like {%kumārī-putra,%} ‘son of a maiden,’<sup>44</sup> and the
<div n="lb"/>‘son of an unmarried girl’ ({%agrū%}), spoken of in the Rigveda<sup>45</sup>
<div n="lb"/>as exposed and attacked by animals, point in the same
<div n="lb"/>direction. The Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>46</sup> seems to recognize
<div n="lb"/>prostitution as a profession. Pischel<sup>47</sup> sees many references
<div n="lb"/>to Hetairai in the Rigveda, which as Geldner<sup>48</sup> insists reflects in
<div n="lb"/>its imagery the court life of Indian princes. But the correct-
<div n="lb"/>ness of the view of these two scholars on this point is not by
<div n="lb"/>any means certain.<sup>49</sup>
<div n="P"/>({%d%}) Adultery was generally regarded among Āryan peoples
<div n="lb"/>as a serious offence against the husband of the woman affected.
<div n="lb"/>We accordingly find in the legal literature of India traces of
<div n="lb"/>the rule that an adulterer can be slain with impunity if taken
<div n="lb"/>in the act.<sup>50</sup> Weber,<sup>51</sup> however, has adduced some material
<div n="lb"/>indicating an indifference to these matters in Vedic times, and
<div n="lb"/>Ludwig<sup>52</sup> has adopted the same view. But, as Delbrück<sup>53</sup> has
<div n="lb"/>clearly shown, the evidence is not convincing; the cited pre-
<div n="lb"/>scriptions<sup>54</sup> forbidding connexion with another man's wife
<div n="lb"/>during a certain rite do not imply that such connexion would
<div n="lb"/>otherwise be allowed: the ritual of the Varuṇa-praghāsas,<sup>55</sup>
<div n="lb"/>when a wife names her lover or lovers, seems originally to have
<div n="lb"/>been a solemn means of banishing the evil brought on a family
<div n="lb"/>by a wife's fall; {@Yājñavalkya's@} famous saying<sup>56</sup> that no one
[Page1-397+ 48]
<div n="lb"/>cares whether a wife is ‘unchaste’ ({%paraḥ-puṃsā%}) or not is a
<div n="lb"/>mere mistranslation,<sup>57</sup> the expression {%paraḥ-puṃsā%} really mean-
<div n="lb"/>ing ‘removed from the male persons.’ And the uncertainty
<div n="lb"/>asserted in some passages<sup>58</sup> as to origin from a Ṛṣi is not a
<div n="lb"/>sign of doubtful descent, but is due to the fact that Ṛṣihood
<div n="lb"/>was a difficult matter to ascertain. None the less woman's
<div n="lb"/>position was lowered by the prevalence of polygamy, and such
<div n="lb"/>stories as that of Ahalyā and Indra<sup>59</sup> are not compatible with
<div n="lb"/>a very high standard of morality. A similar conclusion is
<div n="lb"/>pointed to by references in the Yajurveda<sup>60</sup> to relations between
<div n="lb"/>the Ārya man and the Śūdrā woman, and by a spell given in
<div n="lb"/>the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad<sup>61</sup> to expiate relations with the
<div n="lb"/>wife of a Śrotriya (Brahmin theologian).
<div n="P"/>({%e%}) Incest was recognized in the marriage of brother and
<div n="lb"/>sister as appears from the legend of Yama and Yamī in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda,<sup>62</sup> which clearly shows that such a marriage was not
<div n="lb"/>approved by the feeling of the Vedic age. There is also another
<div n="lb"/>hymn<sup>63</sup> in which reference to such intercourse appears to be
<div n="lb"/>made. Mention is further made in the Rigveda<sup>64</sup> to the
<div n="lb"/>wedlock of Prajāpati and his daughter, which is, however,
<div n="lb"/>interpreted mythologically in the Brāhmaṇas,<sup>65</sup> an interpre-
<div n="lb"/>tation which may be correct. That incest, however, actually
<div n="lb"/>did take place is clear from the Atharvaveda;<sup>66</sup> but even though
<div n="lb"/>the mythological interpretation of the passage were not justi-
<div n="lb"/>fied, no conclusion could be drawn from the hymn as to the
<div n="lb"/>normal occurrence of such relations.

<div n="lb"/>which is, unhappily, far from intelligible. But there is no

<L>1474<pc>1-409<k1>nakzatra<k2>nakzatra
{@Nakṣatra@}¦ is a word of obscure origin and derivation. The
<div n="lb"/>Indian interpreters already show a great divergence of opinion
<div n="lb"/>as to its primary meaning. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> re-
<div n="lb"/>solves it into {%na-kṣatra%} (‘no power’), explaining it by a legend.
<div n="lb"/>The Nirukta<sup>2</sup> refers it to the root {%nakṣ,%} ‘obtain,’ following the
<div n="lb"/>Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>3</sup> Aufrecht<sup>4</sup> and Weber<sup>5</sup> derived it from
<div n="lb"/>{%nakta-tra,%} ‘guardian of night,’ and more recently<sup>6</sup> the derivation
<div n="lb"/>from {%nak-kṣatra,%} ‘having rule over night,’ seems to be gaining
<div n="lb"/>acceptance. The generic meaning of the word therefore seems
<div n="lb"/>to be ‘star.’
<div n="P"/>{%The Nakṣatras as Stars in the Rigveda and Later.%} — The sense
<div n="lb"/>of ‘star’ appears to be adequate for all or nearly all the passages
<div n="lb"/>in which Nakṣatra occurs in the Rigveda.<sup>7</sup> The same sense
<div n="lb"/>occurs in the later Saṃhitās also: the sun and the Nakṣatras are
<div n="lb"/>mentioned together,<sup>8</sup> or the sun, the moon, and the Nakṣatras,<sup>9</sup>
<div n="lb"/>or the moon and the Nakṣatras,<sup>10</sup> or the Nakṣatras alone;<sup>11</sup>
[Page1-410+ 55]
<div n="lb"/>but there is no necessity to attribute to the word the sense of
<div n="lb"/>‘lunar mansion’ in these passages.
<div n="P"/>On the other hand, the names of at least three of the
<div n="lb"/>Nakṣatras in the later sense occur in the Rigveda. Tiṣya,<sup>12</sup>
<div n="lb"/>however, does not seem to be mentioned as a lunar mansion.
<div n="lb"/>With {@Aghās@} (plur.) and {@Arjunī@} (dual)<sup>13</sup> the case is different:
<div n="lb"/>it seems probable that they are the later lunar mansions called
<div n="lb"/>Maghās (plur.) and Phalgunī (dual). The names appear to
<div n="lb"/>have been deliberately changed in the Rigveda, and it must be
<div n="lb"/>remembered that the hymn in which they occur, the wedding
<div n="lb"/>hymn of Sūryā, has no claim to great age.<sup>14</sup> Ludwig<sup>15</sup> and
<div n="lb"/>Zimmer<sup>16</sup> have seen other references to the Nakṣatras as
<div n="lb"/>27 in the Rigveda,<sup>17</sup> but these seem most improbable. Nor
<div n="lb"/>do the adjectives {%revatī%} (‘rich’) and {%punarvasā%} (‘bringing
<div n="lb"/>wealth again’) in another hymn<sup>18</sup> appear to refer to the
<div n="lb"/>Nakṣatras.
<div n="P"/>{%The Nakṣatras as Lunar Mansions.%} — In several passages of the
<div n="lb"/>later Saṃhitās the connexion of the moon and the Nakṣatras
<div n="lb"/>is conceived of as a marriage union. Thus in the Kāṭhaka<sup>19</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and Taittirīya Saṃhitās<sup>20</sup> it is expressly stated that Soma was
<div n="lb"/>wedded to the mansions, but dwelt only with Rohiṇī; the
<div n="lb"/>others being angry, he had ultimately to undertake to live with
<div n="lb"/>them all equally. Weber<sup>21</sup> hence deduced that the Nakṣatras
<div n="lb"/>were regarded as of equal extent, but this is to press the texts
<div n="lb"/>unduly, except in the sense of approximate equality. The
<div n="lb"/>number of the mansions is not stated as 27 in the story told in
<div n="lb"/>the two Saṃhitās: the Taittīriya has 33, and the Kāṭhaka no
[Page1-411+ 56]
<div n="lb"/>number; but 27 appears as their number in the list which is
<div n="lb"/>found in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>22</sup> and elsewhere.<sup>23</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>number 28 is much less well attested: in one passage of the
<div n="lb"/>Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>24</sup> Abhijit is practically marked as a new
<div n="lb"/>comer, though in a later book,<sup>25</sup> in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā,<sup>26</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and in the Atharvaveda list,<sup>27</sup> it has found acceptance. It is
<div n="lb"/>perfectly possible that 28 is the earlier number, and that Abhijit
<div n="lb"/>dropped out because it was faint, or too far north, or because
<div n="lb"/>27 was a more mystic (3×3×3) number: it is significant that
<div n="lb"/>the Chinese Sieou and the Arabic Manāzil are 28 in number.<sup>28</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Weber,<sup>29</sup> however, believes that 27 is the older number in
<div n="lb"/>India.
<div n="P"/>The meaning of the number is easily explained when it is
<div n="lb"/>remembered that a periodic month occupies something between
<div n="lb"/>27 and 28 days, more nearly the former number. Such a month
<div n="lb"/>is in fact recognized in the Lāṭyāyana<sup>30</sup> and Nidāna Sūtras<sup>31</sup>
<div n="lb"/>as consisting of 27 days, 12 months making a year of 324 days,
<div n="lb"/>a Nakṣatra year, or with an intercalary month, a year of
<div n="lb"/>351 days. The Nidāna Sūtra<sup>32</sup> makes an attempt to introduce
<div n="lb"/>the Nakṣatra reckoning into the civil or solar ({%sāvana%}) year
<div n="lb"/>of 360 days, for it holds that the sun spends 13(1/3) days in
<div n="lb"/>each Nakṣatra (13(1/3)×27 = 360). But the month of 27 or
<div n="lb"/>28 days plays no part in the chronological calculations of the
<div n="lb"/>Veda.<sup>33</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%The Names of the Nakṣatras.%} — In addition to the two men-
<div n="lb"/>tioned in the Rigveda, the earlier Atharvaveda<sup>34</sup> gives the
[Page1-412+ 61]
<div n="lb"/>names of Jyeṣṭhaghnī<sup>35</sup> (the later Jyeṣṭhā) and Vicṛtau,<sup>36</sup> which
<div n="lb"/>are mentioned as in close connexion, and of Revatīs (plural)
<div n="lb"/>and Kṛttikās.<sup>37</sup> With reference to possible times for the
<div n="lb"/>ceremony of the Agnyādhāna, or ‘laying of the sacred fires,’
<div n="lb"/>the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā,<sup>38</sup> the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā,<sup>39</sup> and the
<div n="lb"/>Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>40</sup> mention the Nakṣatras called Kṛttikās,
<div n="lb"/>Rohiṇī, Phalgunyas, Hasta; the latter Brāhmaṇa adds Punar-
<div n="lb"/>vasū, and in an additional remark<sup>41</sup> excludes Pūrve Phalgunī
<div n="lb"/>in favour of Uttare Phalgunī. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>42</sup>
<div n="lb"/>adds Mṛgaśīrṣa and Citrā as possibilities. On the other hand,
<div n="lb"/>Punarvasū is recommended by all authorities<sup>43</sup> as suitable for
<div n="lb"/>the Punarādheya, ‘relaying of the sacred fires,’ which takes
<div n="lb"/>place if the first fire has failed to effect the aim of its existence,
<div n="lb"/>the prosperity of the sacrificer.<sup>44</sup> The Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā,<sup>45</sup>
<div n="lb"/>however, allows Anurādhās also.
<div n="P"/>In the ceremony of the Agnicayana, or ‘piling of the fire-
<div n="lb"/>altar,’ the bricks are assumed to be equal in number to the
<div n="lb"/>Nakṣatras. The bricks number 756, and they are equated to
<div n="lb"/>27 Nakṣatras multiplied by 27 secondary Nakṣatras, reckoned
<div n="lb"/>as 720 (instead of 729), with the addition of 36 days, the length
<div n="lb"/>of an intercalary month. Nothing can be usefully derived
<div n="lb"/>from this piece of priestly nonsense.<sup>46</sup> But in connexion with
<div n="lb"/>this ceremony the Yajurveda Saṃhitās<sup>47</sup> enumerate the 27
[Page1-413+ 50]
<div n="lb"/>Nakṣatras, and these lists<sup>48</sup> may be given {%in extenso%} as

<div n="P"/>The Taittirīya Brahmaṇa<sup>49</sup> has a list of the Nakṣatras
<div n="lb"/>which agrees generally with the list of the Saṃhitās. It runs
<div n="lb"/>as follows: Kṛttikās, Rohiṇī, Invakās, Bāhū (dual), Tiṣya,
<div n="lb"/>Āśleṣās, Maghās, Pūrve Phalgunī, Uttare Phalgunī, Hasta,
<div n="lb"/>Citrā, Niṣṭyā, Viśākhe, Anūrādhās, Rohiṇī, Mūlabarhaṇī,
<div n="lb"/>Pūrvā Aṣāḍhās, Uttarā Aṣāḍhās, Śroṇā, Śraviṣṭhās, Śatabhiṣaj,
<div n="lb"/>Pūrve Proṣṭhapadās, Uttare Proṣṭhapadās, Revatī, Aśvayujau,
<div n="lb"/>Apabharaṇīs. In a later book,<sup>50</sup> however, the list grows to 28,
[Page1-414+ 50]
<div n="lb"/>and the full moon is inserted after number 14, and the new
<div n="lb"/>moon after number 28, as an attempt to bring the Nākṣatra
<div n="lb"/>(lunar) month into accordance with the Sāvana (solar) month
<div n="lb"/>of 30 days. The names in this second list are as in the
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitās with the following exceptions. The seven stars of
<div n="lb"/>the Kṛttikās are named as Ambā, Dulā, Nitatnī, Abhrayantī,
<div n="lb"/>Meghayantī, Varṣayantī, Cupuṇīkā, names found also in the
<div n="lb"/>Taittirīya<sup>51</sup> and Kāṭhaka Saṃhitās.<sup>52</sup> Beside Mṛgaśīrṣa, Invakās
<div n="lb"/>are also mentioned.<sup>53</sup> Then come Ārdrā, Punarvasū, Tiṣya,
<div n="lb"/>Āśreṣās, Maghās (beside which Anaghās, Agadās, and Arun-
<div n="lb"/>dhatīs are also mentioned), Phalgunyas (but elsewhere in the
<div n="lb"/>dual, Phalgunyau),<sup>54</sup> Phalgunyas, Hasta, Citrā, Niṣṭyā, Viśākhe,
<div n="lb"/>Anūrādhās, Jyeṣṭhā, Mūla, Aṣāḍhās, Aṣāḍhās, Abhijit, Śronā,
<div n="lb"/>Śraviṣṭhās, Śatabhiṣaj, Proṣṭhapadās, Proṣṭhapadās, Revatī,
<div n="lb"/>Aśvayujau, Bharaṇyas, but also Apabharaṇīs.<sup>55</sup> Abhijit, which
<div n="lb"/>occurs also in an earlier part of the Brāhmaṇa,<sup>56</sup> is perhaps
<div n="lb"/>interpolated. But Weber's<sup>57</sup> argument that Abhijit is out of
<div n="lb"/>place in this list because Brāhmaṇa is here mentioned as the
<div n="lb"/>28th Nakṣatra, loses some force from the fact (of course unknown
<div n="lb"/>to him) that the list in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā<sup>58</sup> contains
<div n="lb"/>28 Nakṣatras, including Abhijit, and adds Brāhmaṇa at the end
<div n="lb"/>as another.
<div n="P"/>In another passage<sup>59</sup> the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa divides the
<div n="lb"/>Nakṣatras into two sets, the Deva Nakṣatras and the Yama
<div n="lb"/>Nakṣatras, being 1-14 and 15-27 (with the omission of Abhijit)
<div n="lb"/>respectively. This division corresponds with one in the third
<div n="lb"/>book of the Brāhmaṇa<sup>60</sup> where the days of the light half of
<div n="lb"/>the month and those of the dark half are equated with the
<div n="lb"/>Nakṣatras. The Brāhmaṇa treats the former series as south,
<div n="lb"/>the latter as north; but this has no relation to facts, and
<div n="lb"/>can only be regarded as a ritual absurdity.
<div n="P"/>The late nineteenth book of the Atharvaveda contains a
<div n="lb"/>list<sup>61</sup> of the Nakṣatras, including Abhijit. The names here
[Page1-415+ 53]
<div n="lb"/>given are: Kṛttikās, Rohiṇī, Mṛgaśiras, Ārdrā, Punarvasū,
<div n="lb"/>Puṣya, Āśleṣās, Maghās, Pūrvā Phalgunyau ({%sic%}),<sup>62</sup> Hasta,
<div n="lb"/>Citrā, Svāti (masc.),<sup>63</sup> Viśākhe, Anurādhā,<sup>64</sup> Jyeṣṭhā, Mūla,
<div n="lb"/>Pūrvā Aṣāḍhās,<sup>65</sup> Uttarā Aṣāḍhās, Abhijit, Śravaṇa, Śraviṣṭhās,
<div n="lb"/>Śatabhiṣaj, Dvayā Proṣṭhapadā, Revatī, Aśvayujau, Bharaṇyas.
<div n="P"/>{%The Position of the Nakṣatras.%} — There is nothing definite in
<div n="lb"/>Vedic literature regarding the position of most of the Nakṣatras,
<div n="lb"/>but the later astronomy precisely locates all of them, and its
<div n="lb"/>statements agree on the whole satisfactorily with what is said
<div n="lb"/>in the earlier texts, though Weber<sup>66</sup> was inclined to doubt this.

<div n="lb"/>occurrence, however, as early as the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā,<sup>91</sup>

<div n="lb"/>Capricorni. But Whitney<sup>95</sup> argues effectively that the words
<div n="lb"/>‘over’ and ‘under’ really refer to the place of Abhijit in the

<div n="P"/>{%The Nakṣatras and the Months.%} — In the Brāhmaṇas the
<div n="lb"/>Nakṣatra names are regularly used to denote dates. This is
<div n="lb"/>done in two ways. The name, if not already a feminine, may
<div n="lb"/>be turned into a feminine and compounded with {%pūrṇa-māsa,%}
<div n="lb"/>‘the full moon,’ as in {%Tiṣyā-pūrṇamāsa,%} ‘the full moon in the
<div n="lb"/>Nakṣatra Tiṣya.’<sup>103</sup> Much more often, however, it is turned
<div n="lb"/>into a derivative adjective, used with {%paurṇamāsī,%} ‘the full
[Page1-420+ 52]
<div n="lb"/>moon (night),’ or with {%amāvāsyā,%} ‘the new moon (night),’ as in
<div n="lb"/>{%Phālgunī paurṇamāsī,%} ‘the full-moon night in the Nakṣatra
<div n="lb"/>Phalgunī’;<sup>104</sup> or, as is usual in the Sūtras, the Nakṣatra adjec-
<div n="lb"/>tive alone is used to denote the full-moon night. The month
<div n="lb"/>itself is called by a name derived<sup>105</sup> from that of a Nakṣatra,
<div n="lb"/>but only Phālguna,<sup>106</sup> Caitra,<sup>107</sup> Vaiśākha,<sup>108</sup> Taiṣya,<sup>109</sup> Māgha<sup>110</sup>
<div n="lb"/>occur in the Brāhmaṇas, the complete list later being Phālguna,
<div n="lb"/>Caitra, Vaiśākha, Jyaiṣṭha, Āṣāḍha, Śrāvaṇa, Prauṣṭhapada,
<div n="lb"/>Āśvayuja, Kārttika, Mārgaśīrṣa, Taiṣya, Māgha. Strictly
<div n="lb"/>speaking, these should be lunar months, but the use of a lunar
<div n="lb"/>year was clearly very restricted: we have seen that as early as
<div n="lb"/>the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa there was a tendency to equate lunar
<div n="lb"/>months with the twelve months of thirty days which made up
<div n="lb"/>the solar year (see {@Māsa@}).
<div n="P"/>{%The Nakṣatras and Chronology.%} — (1) An endeavour has been
<div n="lb"/>made to ascertain from the names of the months the period at
<div n="lb"/>which the systematic employment of those names was intro-
<div n="lb"/>duced. Sir William Jones<sup>111</sup> refers to this possibility, and
<div n="lb"/>Bentley, by the gratuitous assumption that Śrāvaṇa always
<div n="lb"/>marked the summer solstice, concluded that the names of the
<div n="lb"/>months did not date before B.C. 1181. Weber<sup>112</sup> considered
<div n="lb"/>that there was a possibility of fixing a date by this means, but
<div n="lb"/>Whitney<sup>113</sup> has convincingly shown that it is an impossible
<div n="lb"/>feat, and Thibaut<sup>114</sup> concurs in this view. Twelve became
<div n="lb"/>fixed as the number of the months because of the desire,
<div n="lb"/>evident in the Brāhmaṇas, somehow or other to harmonize
<div n="lb"/>lunar with solar time; but the selection of twelve Nakṣatras
<div n="lb"/>out of twenty-seven as connected with the night of full moon
<div n="lb"/>can have no chronological significance, because full moon at
[Page1-421+ 55]
<div n="lb"/>no period occurred in those twelve only, but has at all periods
<div n="lb"/>occurred in every one of the twenty-seven at regularly re-
<div n="lb"/>current intervals.
<div n="P"/>(2) All the lists of the Nakṣatras begin with Kṛttīkās. It is
<div n="lb"/>only fair to suppose that there was some special reason for this
<div n="lb"/>fact. Now the later list of the Nakṣatras begins with Aśvinī,
<div n="lb"/>and it was unquestionably rearranged because at the time of its
<div n="lb"/>adoption the vernal equinox coincided with the star <lang n="greek"></lang> Piscium
<div n="lb"/>on the border of Revatī and Aśvinī,<sup>115</sup> say in the course of the
<div n="lb"/>sixth century A.D. Weber<sup>116</sup> has therefore accepted the view
<div n="lb"/>that the Kṛttikās were chosen for a similar reason, and the
<div n="lb"/>date at which that Nakṣatra coincided with the vernal equinox
<div n="lb"/>has been estimated at some period in the third millennium B.C.<sup>117</sup>
<div n="lb"/>A very grave objection to this view is its assumption that the
<div n="lb"/>sun, and not the moon, was then regarded as connected with
<div n="lb"/>the Nakṣatras; and both Thibaut<sup>118</sup> and Oldenberg<sup>119</sup> have
<div n="lb"/>pronounced decidedly against the idea of connecting the
<div n="lb"/>equinox with the Kṛttikās. Jacobi<sup>120</sup> has contended that in
<div n="lb"/>the Rigveda<sup>121</sup> the commencement of the rains and the summer
<div n="lb"/>solstice mark the beginning of the new year and the end of the
<div n="lb"/>old, and that further the new year began with the summer
<div n="lb"/>solstice in Phalgunī.<sup>121</sup> He has also referred to the distinction
<div n="lb"/>of the two sets of Deva and Yama Nakṣatras in the Taittirīya
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa<sup>122</sup> as supporting his view of the connexion of the
<div n="lb"/>sun and the Nakṣatras. But this view is far from satisfactory:
<div n="lb"/>the Rigveda passages cannot yield the sense required except
<div n="lb"/>by translating the word {%dvādaśa%}<sup>123</sup> as ‘the twelfth (month)’
<div n="lb"/>instead of ‘consisting of twelve parts,’ that is, ‘year,’ the accepted
[Page1-422+ 61]
<div n="lb"/>interpretation; and the division of the Nakṣatras is not at all
<div n="lb"/>satisfactorily explained by a supposed connexion with the sun. It
<div n="lb"/>may further be mentioned that even if the Nakṣatra of Kṛttikās
<div n="lb"/>be deemed to have been chosen because of its coincidence with
<div n="lb"/>the vernal equinox, both Whitney<sup>124</sup> and Thibaut<sup>125</sup> are pre-
<div n="lb"/>pared to regard it as no more than a careless variant of the date
<div n="lb"/>given by the Jyotiṣa, which puts the winter solstice in Māgha.
<div n="P"/>(3) The winter solstice in Māgha is assured by a Brāhmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>text, for the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa<sup>126</sup> expressly places it in the
<div n="lb"/>new moon of Māgha ({%māghasyāmāvāsyāyām%}). It is not very
<div n="lb"/>important whether we take this with the commentators<sup>127</sup> as
<div n="lb"/>the new moon in the middle of a month commencing with the
<div n="lb"/>day after full moon in Taiṣa, or, which is much more likely, as
<div n="lb"/>the new moon beginning the month and preceding full moon in
<div n="lb"/>Māgha. The datum gives a certain possibility of fixing an epoch
<div n="lb"/>in the following way. If the end of Revatī marked the vernal
<div n="lb"/>equinox at one period, then the precession of the equinoxes would
<div n="lb"/>enable us to calculate at what point of time the vernal equinox
<div n="lb"/>was in a position corresponding to the winter solstice in Māgha,
<div n="lb"/>when the solstitial colure cut the ecliptic at the beginning of
<div n="lb"/>Śraviṣṭhās. This would be, on the strict theory, in the third
<div n="lb"/>quarter of Bharaṇī, 6(3/4) asterisms removed from Śraviṣṭhās, and
<div n="lb"/>the difference between that and the beginning of Aśvinī=
[Page1-423+ 48]
<div n="lb"/>1(3/4) asterisms = 23(1/3)º (27 asterisms being = 360º). Taking the
<div n="lb"/>starting-point at 499 A.D., the assured period of Varāha Mihira,
<div n="lb"/>Jones<sup>128</sup> arrived at the date B. C. 1181 for the vernal equinox
<div n="lb"/>corresponding to the winter solstice in Māgha — that is, on the
<div n="lb"/>basis of 1º = 72 years as the precession. Pratt<sup>129</sup> arrived at
<div n="lb"/>precisely the same date, taking the same rate of precession and
<div n="lb"/>adopting as his basis the ascertained position in the Siddhāntas
<div n="lb"/>of the junction star<sup>130</sup> of Maghā, <lang n="greek"></lang> Leonis or Regulus. Davis<sup>131</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and Colebrooke<sup>132</sup> arrived at a different date, B.C. 1391, by
<div n="lb"/>taking as the basis of their calculation the junction star of Citrā,
<div n="lb"/>which happens to be of uncertain position, varying as much as
<div n="lb"/>3º in the different textbooks. But though the twelfth century
<div n="lb"/>has received a certain currency as the epoch of the observation
<div n="lb"/>in the Jyotiṣa,<sup>133</sup> it is of very doubtful value. As Whitney
<div n="lb"/>points out, it is impossible to say that the earlier asterisms
<div n="lb"/>coincided in position with the later asterisms of 13(1/3)º extent
<div n="lb"/>each. They were not chosen as equal divisions, but as groups
<div n="lb"/>of stars which stood in conjunction with the moon; and the
<div n="lb"/>result of subsequently making them strictly equal divisions
<div n="lb"/>was to throw the principal stars of the later groups altogether
<div n="lb"/>out of their asterisms.<sup>134</sup> Nor can we say that the star <lang n="greek"></lang> Piscium
<div n="lb"/>early formed the eastern boundary of Revatī; it may possibly
<div n="lb"/>not even have been in that asterism at all, for it is far remote
<div n="lb"/>from the Chinese and Arabic asterisms corresponding to Revatī.
<div n="lb"/>Added to all this, and to the uncertainty of the starting-point — 
<div n="lb"/>582 A.D., 560 A.D., or 491 A.D. being variants<sup>135</sup> — is the fact that
<div n="lb"/>the place of the equinox is not a matter accurately determin-
<div n="lb"/>able by mere observation, and that the Hindu astronomers of
<div n="lb"/>the Vedic period cannot be deemed to have been very accurate
<div n="lb"/>observers, since they made no precise determination of the
[Page1-424+ 78]
<div n="lb"/>number of days of the year, which even in the Jyotiṣa they do
<div n="lb"/>not determine more precisely than as 366 days, and even
<div n="lb"/>the Sūrya Siddhānta<sup>136</sup> does not know the precession of the
<div n="lb"/>equinoxes. It is therefore only fair to allow a thousand years
<div n="lb"/>for possible errors,<sup>137</sup> and the only probable conclusion to be
<div n="lb"/>drawn from the datum of the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa is that it
<div n="lb"/>was recording an observation which must have been made some
<div n="lb"/>centuries B.C., in itself a result quite in harmony with the
<div n="lb"/>probable date of the Brāhmaṇa literature,<sup>138</sup> say B.C. 800-600.
<div n="P"/>(4) Another chronological argument has been derived from
<div n="lb"/>the fact that there is a considerable amount of evidence for
<div n="lb"/>Phālguna having been regarded as the beginning of the year,
<div n="lb"/>since the full moon in Phalgunī is often described as the
<div n="lb"/>‘mouth ({%mukham%}) of the year.’<sup>139</sup> Jacobi<sup>140</sup> considers that this
[Page1-425+ 54]
<div n="lb"/>was due to the fact that the year was reckoned from the winter
<div n="lb"/>solstice, which would coincide with the month of Phālguna
<div n="lb"/>about B.C. 4000. Oldenberg<sup>141</sup> and Thibaut,<sup>142</sup> on the other
<div n="lb"/>hand, maintain that the choice of Phālguna as the ‘mouth’ of
<div n="lb"/>the year was due to its being the first month of spring. This
<div n="lb"/>view is favoured by the fact that there is distinct evidence<sup>143</sup>
<div n="lb"/>of the correspondence of Phālguna and the beginning of spring:
<div n="lb"/>as we have seen above in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, the new
<div n="lb"/>moon in Māgha is placed at the winter solstice,<sup>144</sup> which puts
<div n="lb"/>the full moon of Phalgunī at a month and a half after the
<div n="lb"/>winter solstice, or in the first week of February, a date not in
<div n="lb"/>itself improbable for about B.C. 800, and corresponding with
<div n="lb"/>the February 7 of the {%veris initium%} in the Roman Calendar.
<div n="lb"/>This fact accords with the only natural division of the year
<div n="lb"/>into three periods of four months, as the rainy season lasts from
<div n="lb"/>June 7-10 to October 7-10, and it is certain that the second set
<div n="lb"/>of four months dates from the beginning of the rains (see
<div n="lb"/>{@Cāturmāsya@}). Tilak,<sup>145</sup> on the other hand, holds that the
<div n="lb"/>winter solstice coincided with Māghī full moon at the time of the
<div n="lb"/>Taittirīya Saṃhitā (B.C. 2350), and had coincided with Phālgunī
<div n="lb"/>and Caitrī in early periods — viz., B.C. 4000-2500, and B.C. 6000-
<div n="lb"/>4000.
<div n="P"/>(5) The passages of the Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>146</sup> and the Pañca-
<div n="lb"/>viṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>147</sup> which treat the full moon in Phālguna as
<div n="lb"/>the beginning of the year, give as an alternative the full moon
<div n="lb"/>in Caitra. Probably the latter month was chosen so as to
<div n="lb"/>secure that the initial day should fall well within the season of
<div n="lb"/>spring,<sup>148</sup> and was not, as Jacobi believes, a relic of a period
[Page1-426+ 49]
<div n="lb"/>when the winter solstice corresponded with Caitra. Another
<div n="lb"/>alternative is the Ekāṣṭakā, interpreted by the commentators as
<div n="lb"/>the eighth day after the full moon in Maghās, a time which
<div n="lb"/>might, as being the last quarter of the waning half of the old
<div n="lb"/>year, well be considered as representing the end of the year.
<div n="lb"/>A fourth alternative is the fourth day before full moon; the full
<div n="lb"/>moon meant must be that of Caitra, as Ālekhana quoted by
<div n="lb"/>Āpastamba held, not of Māgha, as Āśmarathya, Laugākṣi and
<div n="lb"/>the Mīmāṃsists believed, and as Tilak believes.<sup>149</sup>
<div n="P"/>(6) Others, again, according to the Gṛhya ritual, began the
<div n="lb"/>year with the month Mārgaśīrṣa, as is shown by its other name
<div n="lb"/>Āgrahāyaṇa<sup>150</sup> (‘belonging to the commencement of the year’).
<div n="lb"/>Jacobi and Tilak<sup>151</sup> think that this one denoted the autumn
<div n="lb"/>equinox in Mṛgaśiras, corresponding to the winter solstice in
<div n="lb"/>Phalgunī. But, as Thibaut<sup>152</sup> shows clearly, it was selected as
<div n="lb"/>the beginning of a year that was taken to commence with
<div n="lb"/>autumn, just as some took the spring to commence with Caitra
<div n="lb"/>instead of Phālguna.<sup>153</sup>
<div n="P"/>(7) Jacobi has also argued, with the support of Bühler,<sup>154</sup>
<div n="lb"/>from the terms given for the beginning of Vedic study in the
<div n="lb"/>Gṛhya Sūtras, on the principle that study commenced with the
<div n="lb"/>rains (as in the Buddhist {%vassā%}) which mark the summer
<div n="lb"/>solstice. He concludes that if Bhādrapada appears as the
<div n="lb"/>date of commencing study in some texts, it was fixed thus
<div n="lb"/>because at one time Proṣṭhapadās (the early name of Bhadra-
<div n="lb"/>padās) coincided with the summer solstice, this having been the
<div n="lb"/>case when the winter solstice was in Phālguna. But Whitney<sup>155</sup>
<div n="lb"/>has pointed out that this argument is utterly illegitimate; we
<div n="lb"/>cannot say that there was any necessary connexion between the
<div n="lb"/>rains and learning — a month like Śrāvaṇa might be preferred
[Page1-427+ 89]
<div n="lb"/>because of its connexion with the word Śravaṇa, ‘ear’ — and
<div n="lb"/>in view of the precession of the equinoxes, we must assume that
<div n="lb"/>Bhādrapada was kept because of its traditional coincidence
<div n="lb"/>with the beginning of the rains after it had ceased actually so
<div n="lb"/>to coincide.<sup>156</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%The Origin of the Nakṣatras.%} — As we have seen, there is no
<div n="lb"/>evidence showing the process by which the Nakṣatras may
[Page1-428+ 52]
<div n="lb"/>have originated in India. They are mentioned only as stars in
<div n="lb"/>the earlier parts of the Rigveda, then the names of three of
<div n="lb"/>them are found in the latest parts of that Saṃhitā, and finally
<div n="lb"/>in the later Atharvaveda and in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās the
<div n="lb"/>full list appears. It may also be noted that the Vedic Indians
<div n="lb"/>show (see {@Graha@}) a remarkably small knowledge of the other
<div n="lb"/>astronomical phenomena; the discovery of a series of 27 lunar
<div n="lb"/>mansions by them would therefore be rather surprising. On
<div n="lb"/>the other hand, the nature of such an operation is not very
<div n="lb"/>complicated; it consists merely in selecting a star or a star
<div n="lb"/>group with which the moon is in conjunction. It is thus
<div n="lb"/>impossible {%a priori%} to deny that the Vedic Indians could have
<div n="lb"/>invented for themselves a lunar Zodiac.<sup>157</sup>
<div n="P"/>But the question is complicated by the fact that there exist
<div n="lb"/>two similar sets of 28 stars or star groups in Arabia and in
<div n="lb"/>China, the Manāzil and the Sieou. The use of the Manāzil in
<div n="lb"/>Arabia is consistent and effective; the calendar is regulated by
<div n="lb"/>them, and the position of the asterisms corresponds best with
<div n="lb"/>the positions required for a lunar Zodiac. The Indians might
<div n="lb"/>therefore have borrowed the system from Arabia, but that is a
<div n="lb"/>mere possibility, because the evidence for the existence of the
<div n="lb"/>Manāzil is long posterior to that for the existence of the
<div n="lb"/>Nakṣatras, while again the Mazzaroth or Mazzaloth of the Old
<div n="lb"/>Testament<sup>158</sup> may really be the lunar mansions.<sup>159</sup> That the
<div n="lb"/>Arabian system is borrowed from India, as Burgess<sup>160</sup> held, is,
<div n="lb"/>on the other hand, not at all probable.
<div n="P"/>Biot, the eminent Chinese scholar, in a series of papers
<div n="lb"/>published by him between 1839 and 1861,<sup>161</sup> attempted to prove
[Page1-429+ 48]
<div n="lb"/>the derivation of the Nakṣatra from the Chinese Sieou. The
<div n="lb"/>latter he did not regard as being in origin lunar mansions at all.
<div n="lb"/>He thought that they were equatorial stars used, as in modern
<div n="lb"/>astronomy, as a standard to which planets or other stars
<div n="lb"/>observed in the neighbourhood can be referred; they were, as
<div n="lb"/>regards twenty-four of them, selected about B.C. 2357 on
<div n="lb"/>account of their proximity to the equator, and of their having
<div n="lb"/>the same right ascension as certain circumpolar stars which had
<div n="lb"/>attracted the attention of Chinese observers. Four more were
<div n="lb"/>added in B.C. 1100 in order to mark the equinoxes and solstices
<div n="lb"/>of the period. He held that the list of stars commenced with
<div n="lb"/>Mao (= Kṛttikās), which was at the vernal equinox in B.C. 2357.
<div n="lb"/>Weber,<sup>162</sup> in an elaborate essay of 1860, disputed this theory,
<div n="lb"/>and endeavoured to show that the Chinese literary evidence for
<div n="lb"/>the Sieou was late, dating not even from before the third
<div n="lb"/>century B.C. The last point does not appear<sup>163</sup> to be correct,
<div n="lb"/>but his objections against the basis of Biot's theory were rein-
<div n="lb"/>forced by Whitney,<sup>164</sup> who insisted that Biot's supposition of
<div n="lb"/>the Sieou's not having been ultimately derived from a system of
<div n="lb"/>lunar mansions, was untenable. This is admitted by the latest
<div n="lb"/>defender of the hypothesis of borrowing from China, Léopold
<div n="lb"/>de Saussure,<sup>165</sup> , but his arguments in favour of a Chinese origin
<div n="lb"/>for the Indian lunar mansions have been refuted by Oldenberg,<sup>166</sup>
<div n="lb"/>who has also pointed out<sup>167</sup> that the series does not begin with
<div n="lb"/>Mao (= Kṛttikās).
<div n="P"/>There remains only the possibility that a common source for
<div n="lb"/>all the three sets — Nakṣatra, Manāzil, and Sieou — may be
<div n="lb"/>found in Babylonia. Hommel<sup>168</sup> has endeavoured to show
<div n="lb"/>that recent research has established in Babylonia the existence
<div n="lb"/>of a lunar zodiac of twenty-four members headed by the
[Page1-430+ 120]
<div n="lb"/>Pleiades (= Kṛttikās); but Thibaut's researches<sup>169</sup> are not
<div n="lb"/>favourable to this claim. On the other hand, Weber,<sup>170</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Whitney,<sup>171</sup> Zimmer,<sup>172</sup> and Oldenberg<sup>173</sup> all incline to the
<div n="lb"/>view that in Babylonia is to be found the origin of the system,
<div n="lb"/>and this must for the present be regarded as the most probable
<div n="lb"/>view, for there are other traces of Babylonian influence in
<div n="lb"/>Vedic literature, such as the legend of the flood, perhaps the
<div n="lb"/>Ādityas,<sup>174</sup> and possibly the word {@Manā.@}

<F>156) Mention should here be made of
<div n="lb"/>the following points: (1) Jacobi's argu-
<div n="lb"/>ment from the word Dhruva, the name
<div n="lb"/>of the star pointed out to the bride in
<div n="lb"/>the marriage ritual. The word does
<div n="lb"/>not occur in the literature anterior to
<div n="lb"/>the Gṛhya Sūtras, and it must remain
<div n="lb"/>an undecided question whether the
<div n="lb"/>practice was or was not old. Jacobi
<div n="lb"/>urges that Dhruva means ‘fixed,’ and
<div n="lb"/>that it must originally have referred to
<div n="lb"/>a real fixed pole star, and he thinks
<div n="lb"/>that such a star could only be found
<div n="lb"/>in the third millennium B.C. Whitney
<div n="lb"/>and Oldenberg definitely reject this
<div n="lb"/>view on the ground that too much
<div n="lb"/>must not be made out of a piece of
<div n="lb"/>folk-lore, and that the marriage ritual
<div n="lb"/>requirements would be satisfied by any
<div n="lb"/>star of some magnitude which was
<div n="lb"/>approximately polar. This conclusion
<div n="lb"/>seems convincing. {%Cf.%} Keith, {%Journal%}
<div n="lb"/>{%of the Royal Asiatic Society,%} 1909, 1102;
<div n="lb"/>1910, 465; {%contra,%} Jacobi, {%ibid.,%} 1909,
<div n="lb"/>726 {%et seq.;%} 1910, 464. (2) The Śata-
<div n="lb"/>patha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 2, 3, asserts
<div n="lb"/>that the Kṛttikās do not move from
<div n="lb"/>the eastern quarter, which the others
<div n="lb"/>do; and stress has been laid (by Jacobi,
<div n="lb"/>{%Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,%} 1910,
<div n="lb"/>463, 464) upon this assertion as giving
<div n="lb"/>a date of the third millennium B.C. for
<div n="lb"/>the Śatapatha observation. But this
<div n="lb"/>notice is quite inadequate to support
<div n="lb"/>any such result, and its lack of trust-
<div n="lb"/>worthiness as a chronological guide is
<div n="lb"/>increased by the fact that the Baudhā-
<div n="lb"/>yana Śrauta Sūtra, xviii 5, has a similar
<div n="lb"/>notice, coupled with another notice,
<div n="lb"/>which, according to Barth, would only
<div n="lb"/>be true somewhere in or after the sixth
<div n="lb"/>century A.D., the equatorial point being
<div n="lb"/>placed between Citrā and Svātī, which
<div n="lb"/>in the early period were both very
<div n="lb"/>much north of the equator (see Caland,
<div n="lb"/>{%Über das rituelle Sūtra des Baudhāyana,%}
<div n="lb"/>37-39). The same passage of the Śata-
<div n="lb"/>patha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 2, 2, in the
<div n="lb"/>Mādhyaṃdina recension, states that
<div n="lb"/>the number of the Kṛttikās is greater
<div n="lb"/>than that of the stars in any of the
<div n="lb"/>other Nakṣatras, which consist of one,
<div n="lb"/>two, three, or four stars, or which,
<div n="lb"/>according to the Kāṇva recension (see
<div n="lb"/>Eggeling, {%Sacred Books of the East,%} 12,
<div n="lb"/>282, n. 2), have four stars. It is not
<div n="lb"/>possible to put much faith in this asser-
<div n="lb"/>tion, for Hasta later has five stars, and
<div n="lb"/>its name (with reference to the fingers)
<div n="lb"/>suggests five ({%cf.%} Weber, {%Naxatra,%} 2,
<div n="lb"/>368, 381), and that number is possibly
<div n="lb"/>referred to in the Rigveda (i. 105, 10).
<div n="lb"/>See Geldner, {%Vedische Studien,%} 3, 177.
<div n="lb"/>(3) Attempts have been made to regard
<div n="lb"/>the names of the Nakṣatras as signifi-
<div n="lb"/>cant of their position in the list. Thus
<div n="lb"/>Bentley, {%Historical View,%} 2, thought
<div n="lb"/>Viśākhā was so called because the
<div n="lb"/>equinoctial colure divided the equator
<div n="lb"/>about 1426 B.C.; this is refuted by
<div n="lb"/>Tilak, {%Orion,%} 57 {%et seq.%} Jyeṣṭhaghnī
<div n="lb"/>has been interpreted as ‘slaying the
<div n="lb"/>eldest’ — {%i.e.,%} as marking the new year
<div n="lb"/>by putting an end to the old year.
<div n="lb"/>Tilak, 90, suggests that Mūla was so
<div n="lb"/>called because its acronycal rising
<div n="lb"/>marked the beginning of the year when
<div n="lb"/>the vernal equinox was near Mṛgaśiras.
<div n="lb"/>More probable is Whitney's view, {%Sārya%}
<div n="lb"/>{%Siddhānta,%} 194, that it was the most
<div n="lb"/>southern, and so, as it were, the basis
<div n="lb"/>of the asterisms.</F>

{@Nābhā-nediṣṭha@}¦ (‘nearest in descent’) {@Mānava@} (‘descendant
<div n="lb"/>of Manu’) is famous in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas<sup>1</sup>
<div n="lb"/>for the way in which he was treated when his father {@Manu@}
<div n="lb"/>divided his property among his sons, or they divided it:
<div n="lb"/>Nābhānediṣṭha was left out, but was solaced by obtaining,
<div n="lb"/>through his father's advice, cows from the Aṅgirases, a feat
<div n="lb"/>which is regarded in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra<sup>2</sup> as on a
<div n="lb"/>level with the exploits of other seers who celebrated their
<div n="lb"/>patrons in hymns, and as giving rise to the hymn, Rigveda x. 62.
<div n="lb"/>Nābhānediṣṭha's hymn is repeatedly mentioned in the Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇas,<sup>3</sup> but beyond its authorship nothing is recorded of him.
<div n="lb"/>In the Saṃhitā<sup>4</sup> itself he seems to be spoken of as a poet in
<div n="lb"/>one passage, which is, however, of quite uncertain meaning.
<div n="P"/>Nābhānediṣṭha is etymologically connected in all probability
<div n="lb"/>with Nabānazdiṣta in the Avesta, which refers to the Fravaṣi
<div n="lb"/>of the paoiryō-ṭkaēsha and the Fravaṣi of the Nabānazdiṣta.
<div n="lb"/>Lassen<sup>5</sup> saw in the legend a reminiscence of an Indo-Iranian
<div n="lb"/>split; but Roth<sup>6</sup> showed conclusively that this was impossible,
<div n="lb"/>and that Nābhānediṣṭha meant simply ‘nearest in birth,’ and
[Page1-443+ 48]
<div n="lb"/>Weber<sup>7</sup> admits that the connexion of the words is not one of
<div n="lb"/>borrowing on either side, but that in the Avesta it has kept its
<div n="lb"/>original sense of ‘nearest relation,’ while in the Rigveda it has
<div n="lb"/>become a proper name.

{@Nāman,@}¦ ‘name,’ is a common word from the Rigveda
<div n="lb"/>onwards. The Gṛhya Sūtras<sup>1</sup> give elaborate rules for the
<div n="lb"/>formation of the names of children, but more important is
<div n="lb"/>the distinction between the secret ({%guhya%}) and the ordinary
<div n="lb"/>name, though the rules as to the secret name are not at all
<div n="lb"/>consistent. The secret name is already recognized in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda,<sup>2</sup> and is referred to in the Brāhmaṇas,<sup>3</sup> one secret
<div n="lb"/>name, that of Arjuna for Indra, being given in the Śatapatha
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa.<sup>4</sup> It is to be noted that the rule as to giving the
[Page1-444+ 54]
<div n="lb"/>designation of a Nakṣatra (lunar asterism) as the secret name
<div n="lb"/>or otherwise is not illustrated by a single recorded name of a
<div n="lb"/>teacher in the Brāhmaṇas.<sup>5</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>6</sup> several times mentions the
<div n="lb"/>adoption of a second name with a view to securing success,
<div n="lb"/>and also refers to the adoption of another name for purposes
<div n="lb"/>of distinction.<sup>7</sup>
<div n="P"/>In actual practice two names are usually found in the
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇas, the second being a patronymic or a metronymic,
<div n="lb"/>as in {@Kakṣīvant Auśija@}<sup>8</sup> (if the story of the slave woman Uśij
<div n="lb"/>as his mother is correct), or {@Bṛhaduktha Vāmneya,@}<sup>9</sup> ‘son of
<div n="lb"/>Vāmnī,’ though the relationship may, of course, be not direct
<div n="lb"/>parentage, but more remote descent.<sup>10</sup> Three names are less
<div n="lb"/>common — for example, {@Kūśāmba Svāyava Lātavya,@}<sup>11</sup> ‘son of
<div n="lb"/>Svāyu, of the Lātavya (son of Latu) family,’ or {@Devataras@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Śyāvasāyana Kāśyapa,@}<sup>12</sup> where the patronymic and the Gotra
<div n="lb"/>name are both found. In other cases the names probably
<div n="lb"/>have a local reference — {%e.g.,%} {@Kauśāmbeya@} and {@Gāṅgya.@} Fre-
<div n="lb"/>quently the patronymic only is given, as {@Bhārgava, Maudgalya,@}
<div n="lb"/>etc., or two patronymics are used. The simple name is often
<div n="lb"/>used for the patronymic — {%e.g.,%} {@Trasadasyu.@}<sup>13</sup> In a few cases
<div n="lb"/>the name of the wife is formed from the husband's name,<sup>14</sup> as

{@Ni-ṣāda@}¦ is found in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas.<sup>1</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The word seems to denote not so much a particular tribe, but
<div n="lb"/>to be the general term for the non-Āryan tribes who were not
<div n="lb"/>under Āryan control, as the Śūdras were, for Aupamanyava<sup>2</sup>
<div n="lb"/>took the five peoples ({%pañca janāḥ%}) to be the four castes ({%catvāro%}
[Page1-454+ 56]
<div n="lb"/>{%varṇāḥ%}) and the Niṣādas, and the commentator Mahīdhara
<div n="lb"/>explains the word where it occurs in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>3</sup>
<div n="lb"/>as meaning a Bhilla, or Bhīl. A village of Niṣādas is men-
<div n="lb"/>tioned in the Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra,<sup>4</sup> and a Niṣāda {@Sthapati,@}
<div n="lb"/>a leader of some kind, is referred to in the Kātyāyana Śrauta
<div n="lb"/>Sūtra<sup>5</sup> and in a Brāhmaṇa cited by the scholiast on that
<div n="lb"/>passage. Weber<sup>6</sup> thinks that the Niṣādas were the settled
<div n="lb"/>aborigines (form {%ni,%} ‘down,’ and {%sad,%} ‘settle’), a view sup-
<div n="lb"/>ported by the fact that the ritual of the Viśvajit sacrifice<sup>7</sup>
<div n="lb"/>requires a temporary residence with Niṣādas; for the Niṣādas
<div n="lb"/>who would permit an Āryan to reside temporarily amongst
<div n="lb"/>them must have been partially amenable to Āryan influence.
<div n="lb"/>But the name might easily be applied to the whole body of
<div n="lb"/>aborigines outside the Āryan organization. Von Schroeder<sup>8</sup>
<div n="lb"/>thinks that the Niṣādas were most probably identical with the
<div n="lb"/>Nysæans, who, according to the Greek account, sent an
<div n="lb"/>embassy to Alexander when he was in the territory of the
<div n="lb"/>Aśvakas, but this identification is doubtful.

{@Nau@}¦ is the regular word in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later<sup>2</sup> for a
<div n="lb"/>‘boat’ or ‘ship.’ In the great majority of cases the ship was
<div n="lb"/>merely a boat for crossing rivers, though no doubt a large boat
<div n="lb"/>was needed for crossing many of the broad rivers of the Panjab
<div n="lb"/>as well as the {@Yamunā@} and {@Gaṅgā.@} Often no doubt the Nau
<div n="lb"/>was a mere dug-out canoe ({%dāru%}).<sup>3</sup> It is certainly against the
<div n="lb"/>theory<sup>4</sup> of the existence in Vedic times of an extensive sea
<div n="lb"/>trade that there is no mention of any of the parts of a ship, such
<div n="lb"/>as masts and sails, except the oar ({@Aritra@}), Yet there are some
<div n="lb"/>allusions indicating a trade more extensive than that implied
<div n="lb"/>by boats used for crossing rivers. The Atharvaveda<sup>5</sup> compares
<div n="lb"/>the ruin of a kingdom where Brahmins are oppressed to the
[Page1-462+ 49]
<div n="lb"/>sinking of a ship which is leaking ({%bhinnā%}); though the language
<div n="lb"/>here employed can be made to fit the theory that the ship was
<div n="lb"/>only a canoe, it cannot naturally be so interpreted. Moreover,
<div n="lb"/>there is mention made in the Rigveda<sup>6</sup> of men who go to the
<div n="lb"/>ocean ({@Samudra@}) eager for gain ({%saniṣyavaḥ%}). It is not altogether
<div n="lb"/>satisfactory to restrict such references with Zimmer<sup>7</sup> to the
<div n="lb"/>broad stream of the Indus after the union of that river with
<div n="lb"/>the tributaries of the Panjab. In the Rigveda<sup>8</sup> too it is said
<div n="lb"/>that the Aśvins rescued {@Bhujyu@} in the ocean with a ship of
<div n="lb"/>a hundred oars ({%śatāritra%}). It is not easy to refuse to recognize
<div n="lb"/>here the existence of larger vessels with many oars used for

{@Pañca-janāḥ,@}¦ the ‘five peoples,’ are mentioned under various
<div n="lb"/>names in Vedic literature.<sup>1</sup> Who are meant by the five is very
<div n="lb"/>uncertain. The Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> explains the five to be
<div n="lb"/>gods, men, Gandharvas and Apsarases, snakes, and the Fathers.
[Page1-467+ 60]
<div n="lb"/>Aupamanyava<sup>3</sup> held that the four castes ({@Varṇa@}) and the
<div n="lb"/>{@Niṣādas@} made up the five, and Sāyaṇa<sup>4</sup> is of the same opinion.
<div n="lb"/>Yāska<sup>5</sup> thinks that the five are the Gandharvas, fathers, gods,
<div n="lb"/>Asuras, and Rakṣases. No one of these explanations can be
<div n="lb"/>regarded as probable. Roth<sup>6</sup> and Geldner<sup>7</sup> think that all the
<div n="lb"/>peoples of the earth are méant: just as there are four quarters
<div n="lb"/>({@Diś@}), there are peoples at the four quarters (N. E. S. W.), with
<div n="lb"/>the Āryan folk in the middle. Zimmer<sup>8</sup> opposes this view on
<div n="lb"/>the ground that the inclusion of all peoples in one expression is
<div n="lb"/>not in harmony with the distinction so often made between
<div n="lb"/>Āryan and Dāsa; that neither {%janāsaḥ,%} ‘men,’<sup>9</sup> nor {%mānuṣāḥ,%}
<div n="lb"/>‘people,’<sup>10</sup> could be used of non-Āryans; that the Soma is
<div n="lb"/>referred to as being among the five tribes;<sup>11</sup> that the five tribes
<div n="lb"/>are mentioned as on the {@Sarasvatī,@}<sup>12</sup> and that Indra is {%pāñca-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%janya,%}<sup>13</sup> ‘belonging to the five peoples.’ He concludes that
<div n="lb"/>Āryans alone are meant, and in particular the five tribes of the
<div n="lb"/>{@Anus, Druhyus, Yadus, Turvaśas,@} and {@Pūrus,@} who are all
<div n="lb"/>mentioned together in one or perhaps two hymns of the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda,<sup>14</sup> and four of whom occur in another hymn.<sup>15</sup> But he
<div n="lb"/>admits that the expression might easily be used more generally
<div n="lb"/>later. Hopkins<sup>16</sup> has combated Zimmer's view, but his own
<div n="lb"/>opinion rests mainly on his theory that there was no people
<div n="lb"/>named Turvaśa, but only a king of the Yadus called Turvaśa,
<div n="lb"/>and that theory is not very probable.

{@Paṇi@}¦ in the Rigveda appears to denote a person who is
<div n="lb"/>rich, but who does not give offerings to the gods, or bestow
<div n="lb"/>{@Dakṣiṇās@} on the priests, and who is therefore an object of
<div n="lb"/>intense dislike to the composers of the Saṃhitā.<sup>1</sup> Hence the
<div n="lb"/>gods are asked to attack the Paṇis, who are also referred to
<div n="lb"/>as being defeated with slaughter.<sup>2</sup> The Paṇi is opposed to the
<div n="lb"/>pious sacrificer as a niggard,<sup>3</sup> and is spoken of as a wolf,<sup>4</sup> the
<div n="lb"/>symbol of enmity. In some passages<sup>5</sup> the Paṇis definitely
<div n="lb"/>appear as mythological figures, demons who withhold the cows
<div n="lb"/>or waters of heaven, and to whom Saramā goes on a mission
<div n="lb"/>from Indra.<sup>6</sup> Among the Paṇis {@Bṛbu@} was apparently important.
<div n="lb"/>In one passage of the Rigveda<sup>7</sup> they are described as {@Beka-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@nāṭas,@} or ‘usurers’ (?). In another<sup>8</sup> they are called {@Dasyus,@}
<div n="lb"/>and styled {%mṛdhra-vāc,%} probably ‘of hostile speech,’ and {%grathin,%}
<div n="lb"/>a word of uncertain meaning. Hillebrandt<sup>9</sup> thinks that the
<div n="lb"/>latter epithet refers to the continuous flow of a speech which
[Page1-472+ 54]
<div n="lb"/>is not understood, and that {%mṛdhra-vāc%} means ‘śpeaking an
<div n="lb"/>enemy's speech,’ though not necessarily with reference to
<div n="lb"/>non-Āryans.<sup>10</sup> In two passages<sup>11</sup> the Paṇis appear as {@Dāsas,@}
<div n="lb"/>and in one<sup>12</sup> a Paṇi is mentioned in connexion with wer-
<div n="lb"/>geld ({@Vaira@}), being apparently regarded as equal to a man
<div n="lb"/>merely in the price put on his life, but in other respects as
<div n="lb"/>inferior.
<div n="P"/>It is difficult to be certain exactly who a Paṇi was. Roth<sup>13</sup>
<div n="lb"/>thinks that the word is derived from {%paṇ,%} ‘barter,’ and that
<div n="lb"/>the Paṇi is properly the man who will give nothing without
<div n="lb"/>return, hence the niggard, who neither worships the gods nor
<div n="lb"/>rewards their priests. This view is accepted by Zimmer<sup>14</sup> and
<div n="lb"/>by Ludwig.<sup>15</sup> The latter scholar thinks the apparent references
<div n="lb"/>to fights with Paṇis are to be explained by their having been
<div n="lb"/>aboriginal traders who went in caravans — as in Arabia and
<div n="lb"/>Northern Africa — prepared to fight, if need be, to protect their
<div n="lb"/>goods against attacks which the Āryans would naturally deem
<div n="lb"/>quite justified. He supports this explanation by the references
<div n="lb"/>to the Paṇis as Dasyus and Dāsas. It is, however, hardly
<div n="lb"/>necessary to do more than regard the Paṇis generally as
<div n="lb"/>non-worshippers of the gods favoured by the singers; the term
<div n="lb"/>is wide enough to cover either the aborigines or hostile Āryan
<div n="lb"/>tribes, as well as demons. Hillebrandt,<sup>16</sup> however, thinks that
<div n="lb"/>a real tribe is meant, the Parnians of Strabo, and that they
<div n="lb"/>were associated with the Dahae ({@Dāsa@}). Moreover, he finds
<div n="lb"/>them associated in one passage<sup>17</sup> with the {@Pārāvatas,@} whom
[Page1-473+ 45]
<div n="lb"/>he identifies with the <lang n="greek"></lang> of Ptolemy,<sup>18</sup> and with {@Bṛṣaya,@}
<div n="lb"/>whom he connects with <lang n="greek"></lang> of Arrian;<sup>19</sup> he also con-
<div n="lb"/>siders that the frequent<sup>20</sup> mention of the Paṇis as opponents
<div n="lb"/>of {@Divodāsa@} shows that the latter was on the Arachosian
<div n="lb"/>Haraqaiti ({@Sarasvatī@}) fighting against the Parnians and Dahae,
<div n="lb"/>as well as other Iranian tribes. But the identification of Paṇi
<div n="lb"/>and the Parnians is needless, especially as the root {%paṇ,%} which
<div n="lb"/>is found also in the Greek <lang n="greek"></lang>, shows a satisfactory deri-
<div n="lb"/>vation, while the transfer of Divodāsa to the Haraqaiti is
<div n="lb"/>improbable. See also {@Divodāsa@} and {@Bekanāṭa.@}

{@Pati, Patnī.@}¦ — Under these words denoting primarily, as the
<div n="lb"/>evidence collected in the St. Petersburg Dictionary shows,
<div n="lb"/>‘lord’ and ‘lady,’ and so ‘husband’ and ‘wife,’ it is convenient
<div n="lb"/>to consider the marital relations of the Vedic community.
<div n="P"/>{%Child Marriage.%} — Marriage in the early Vedic texts appears
<div n="lb"/>essentially as a union of two persons of full development. This
<div n="lb"/>is shown by the numerous references<sup>1</sup> to unmarried girls who
<div n="lb"/>grow old in the house of their fathers ({%amā-jur%}), and who adorn
<div n="lb"/>themselves in desire of marriage, as well as to the paraphernalia
<div n="lb"/>of spells and potions used in the Atharvavedic tradition<sup>2</sup> to
<div n="lb"/>compel the love of man or woman respectively, while even the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda<sup>3</sup> itself seems to present us with a spell by which a
[Page1-475+ 60]
<div n="lb"/>lover seeks to send all the household to sleep when he visits his
<div n="lb"/>beloved. Child wives first occur regularly in the Sūtra period,
<div n="lb"/>though it is still uncertain to what extent the rule of marriage
<div n="lb"/>before puberty there obtained.<sup>4</sup> The marriage ritual also quite
<div n="lb"/>clearly presumes that the marriage is a real and not a nominal
<div n="lb"/>one: an essential feature is the taking of the bride to her
<div n="lb"/>husband's home, and the ensuing cohabitation.<sup>5</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%Limitations on Marriage.%} — It is difficult to say with certainty
<div n="lb"/>within what limits marriage was allowed. The dialogue of
<div n="lb"/>Yama and Yamī in the Rigveda<sup>6</sup> seems clearly to point to a
<div n="lb"/>prohibition of the marriage of brother and sister. It can
<div n="lb"/>hardly be said, as Weber<sup>7</sup> thinks, to point to a practice that
<div n="lb"/>was once in use and later became antiquated. In the Gobhila
<div n="lb"/>Gṛhya Sūtra<sup>8</sup> and the Dharma Sūtras<sup>9</sup> are found prohibitions
<div n="lb"/>against marriage in the {@Gotra@} (‘family’) or within six degrees
<div n="lb"/>on the mother's or father's side, but in the Śatapatha Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa<sup>10</sup> marriage is allowed in the third or fourth generation,
<div n="lb"/>the former being allowed, according to Harisvamin,<sup>11</sup> by the
<div n="lb"/>Kāṇvas, and the second by the Saurāṣṭras, while the Dākṣi-
<div n="lb"/>ṇātyas allowed marriage with the daughter of the mother's
<div n="lb"/>brother or the son of the father's sister, but presumably not
<div n="lb"/>with the daughter of the mother's sister or the son of the
<div n="lb"/>father's brother. The prohibition of marriage within the
<div n="lb"/>Gotra cannot then have existed,<sup>12</sup> though naturally marriages
[Page1-476+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>outside the Gotra were frequent.<sup>13</sup> Similarity of caste was also
<div n="lb"/>not an essential to marriage, as hypergamy was permitted even
<div n="lb"/>by the Dharma Sūtras,<sup>14</sup> so that a Brāhmaṇa could marry
<div n="lb"/>wives of any lower caste, a Kṣatriya wives of the two lowest
<div n="lb"/>castes as well as of his own caste, a Vaiśya a Śūdrā as well as
<div n="lb"/>a Vaiśyā, although the Śūdrā marriages were later disapproved
<div n="lb"/>{%in toto.%} Instances of such intermarriage are common in the
<div n="lb"/>Epic, and are viewed as normal in the Bṛhaddevatā.<sup>15</sup>
<div n="P"/>It was considered proper that the younger brothers and
<div n="lb"/>sisters should not anticipate their elders by marrying before
<div n="lb"/>them. The later Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas<sup>16</sup> present a series
<div n="lb"/>of names expressive of such anticipation, censuring as sinful
<div n="lb"/>those who bear them. These terms are the {%pari-vividāna,%}<sup>17</sup> or
<div n="lb"/>perhaps {%agre-dadhus,%}<sup>18</sup> the man who, though a younger brother,
<div n="lb"/>marries before his elder brother, the latter being then called the
<div n="lb"/>{%parivitta;%}<sup>19</sup> the {%agre-didhiṣu,%}<sup>20</sup> the man who weds a younger
<div n="lb"/>daughter while her elder sister is still unmarried; and the
<div n="lb"/>{@Didhiṣū-pati,@}<sup>21</sup> who is the husband of the latter. The passages
<div n="lb"/>do not explicitly say that the exact order of birth must always
<div n="lb"/>be followed, but the mention of the terms shows that the order
<div n="lb"/>was often broken.
<div n="P"/>{%Widow Remarriage.%} — The remarriage of a widow was
[Page1-477+ 62]
<div n="lb"/>apparently permitted. This seems originally to have taken the
<div n="lb"/>form of the marriage of the widow to the brother or other
<div n="lb"/>nearest kinsman of the dead man in order to produce children.
<div n="lb"/>At any rate, the ceremony is apparently alluded to in a funeral
<div n="lb"/>hymn of the Rigveda;<sup>22</sup> for the alternative explanation, which
<div n="lb"/>sees in the verse a reference to the ritual of the Puruṣamendha
<div n="lb"/>(‘human sacrifice’), although accepted by Hillebrandt<sup>23</sup> and
<div n="lb"/>Delbrück,<sup>24</sup> is not at all probable, while the ordinary view is
<div n="lb"/>supported by the Sūtra evidence.<sup>25</sup> Moreover, another passage
<div n="lb"/>of the Rigveda<sup>26</sup> clearly refers to the marriage of the widow
<div n="lb"/>and the husband's brother ({%devṛ%}), which constitutes what the
<div n="lb"/>Indians later knew as Niyoga.<sup>27</sup> This custom was probably
<div n="lb"/>not followed except in cases where no son was already born.
<div n="lb"/>This custom was hardly remarriage in the strict sense, since
<div n="lb"/>the brother might — so far as appears — be already married
<div n="lb"/>himself. In the Atharvaveda,<sup>28</sup> a verse refers to a charm which
<div n="lb"/>would secure the reunion, in the next world, of a wife and her
<div n="lb"/>second husband. Though, as Delbrück<sup>29</sup> thinks, this very
<div n="lb"/>possibly refers to a case in which the first husband was still
<div n="lb"/>alive,<sup>30</sup> but was impotent or had lost caste ({%patita%}),<sup>31</sup> still it is
<div n="lb"/>certain that the later Dharma Sūtras<sup>32</sup> began to recognize
<div n="lb"/>ordinary remarriage in case of the death of the first husband.
[Page1-478+ 67]
<div n="lb"/>Pischel<sup>33</sup> finds some evidence in the Rigveda<sup>34</sup> to the effect
<div n="lb"/>that a woman could remarry if her husband disappeared and
<div n="lb"/>could not be found or heard of.
<div n="P"/>{%Polygamy.%} — A Vedic Indian could have more than one wife.
<div n="lb"/>This is proved clearly by many passages in the Rigveda;<sup>35</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Manu, according to the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā,<sup>36</sup> had ten wives;
<div n="lb"/>and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>37</sup> explains polygamy by a
<div n="lb"/>characteristic legend. Moreover, the king regularly has four
<div n="lb"/>wives attributed to him, the Mahiṣī,<sup>38</sup> the Parivṛktī,<sup>39</sup> the
<div n="lb"/>Vāvātā,<sup>40</sup> and the Pālāgalī.<sup>41</sup> The Mahiṣī appears to be the
<div n="lb"/>chief wife, being the first one married according to the Śata-
<div n="lb"/>patha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>42</sup> The Parivṛktī, ‘the neglected,’ is explained
<div n="lb"/>by Weber<sup>43</sup> and Pischel<sup>44</sup> as one that has had no son. The
<div n="lb"/>Vāvātā is ‘the favourite,’ while the Pālāgalī is, according to
<div n="lb"/>Weber, the daughter of the last of the court officials. The
<div n="lb"/>names are curious, and not very intelligible, but the evidence
<div n="lb"/>points to the wife first wedded alone being a wife in the fullest
<div n="lb"/>sense. This view is supported by the fact emphasized by
[Page1-479+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>Delbrück,<sup>45</sup> that in the sacrifice the Patnī is usually mentioned
<div n="lb"/>in the singular, apparent exceptions being due to some mytho-
<div n="lb"/>logical reason.<sup>46</sup> Zimmer<sup>47</sup> is of opinion that polygamy is
<div n="lb"/>dying out in the Rigvedic period, monogamy being developed
<div n="lb"/>from polygamy; Weber,<sup>48</sup> however, thinks that polygamy is
<div n="lb"/>secondary, a view that is supported by more recent anthro-
<div n="lb"/>pology.<sup>49</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%Polyandry.%} — On the other hand, polyandry is not Vedic.<sup>50</sup>
<div n="lb"/>There is no passage containing any clear reference to such
<div n="lb"/>a custom. The most that can be said is that in the Rigveda<sup>51</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and the Atharvaveda<sup>52</sup> verses are occasionally found in which
<div n="lb"/>husbands are mentioned in relation to a single wife. It is
<div n="lb"/>difficult to be certain of the correct explanation of each separate
<div n="lb"/>instance of this mode of expression; but even if Weber's<sup>53</sup>
<div n="lb"/>view, that the plural is here used {%majestatis causā,%} is not
<div n="lb"/>accepted, Delbrück's<sup>54</sup> explanation by mythology is probably
<div n="lb"/>right. In other passages<sup>55</sup> the plural is simply generic.
<div n="P"/>{%Marital Relations.%} — Despite polygamy, however, there is
<div n="lb"/>ample evidence that the marriage tie was not, as Weber<sup>56</sup> has
<div n="lb"/>suggested, lightly regarded as far as the fidelity of the wife
<div n="lb"/>was concerned. There is, however, little trace of the husband's
<div n="lb"/>being expected to be faithful as a matter of morality. Several
[Page1-480+ 57]
<div n="lb"/>passages,<sup>57</sup> indeed, forbid, with reference to ritual abstinence,
<div n="lb"/>intercourse with the {%strī%} of another. This may imply that
<div n="lb"/>adultery on the husband's part was otherwise regarded as
<div n="lb"/>venial. But as the word {%strī%} includes all the ‘womenfolk,’
<div n="lb"/>daughters and slaves, as well as wife, the conclusion can hardly
<div n="lb"/>be drawn that intercourse with another man's ‘wife’ was
<div n="lb"/>normally regarded with indifference.<sup>58</sup> The curious ritual of
<div n="lb"/>the Varuṇapraghāsās,<sup>59</sup> in which the wife of the sacrificer is
<div n="lb"/>questioned as to her lovers, is shown by Delbrück<sup>60</sup> to be a
<div n="lb"/>part of a rite meant to expiate unchastity on the part of a wife,
<div n="lb"/>not as a normal question for a sacrificer to put to his own wife.
<div n="lb"/>Again, Yājñavalkya's doctrine in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>61</sup>
<div n="lb"/>which seems to assert that no one cares if a wife is unchaste
<div n="lb"/>({%paraḥ-puṃsā%}) or not, really means that no one cares if the wife
<div n="lb"/>is away from the men who are sacrificing, as the wives of
<div n="lb"/>the gods are apart from them during the particular rite in
<div n="lb"/>question. Monogamy is also evidently approved,<sup>62</sup> so that
<div n="lb"/>some higher idea of morality was in course of formation. On
<div n="lb"/>the other hand, no Vedic text gives us the rule well known to
<div n="lb"/>other Indo-Germanic<sup>63</sup> peoples that the adulterer taken in the
<div n="lb"/>act can be killed with impunity, though the later legal literature
<div n="lb"/>has traces of this rule.<sup>64</sup> There is also abundant evidence that
<div n="lb"/>the standard of ordinary sexual morality was not high.
<div n="P"/>{%Hetairai.%} — In the Rigveda<sup>65</sup> there are many references to
<div n="lb"/>illegitimate love and to the abandonment of the offspring of
[Page1-481+ 59]
<div n="lb"/>such unions,<sup>66</sup> especially in the case of a protégé of Indra,
<div n="lb"/>often mentioned as the {%parāvṛkta%} or {%parāvṛj.%}<sup>67</sup> The ‘son of
<div n="lb"/>a maiden’ ({%kumārī-putra%}) is already spoken of in the Vājasaneyi
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitā.<sup>68</sup> Such a person appears with a metronymic in the
<div n="lb"/>Upaniṣad period:<sup>69</sup> this custom may be the origin of metro-
<div n="lb"/>nymics such as those which make up a great part of the lists
<div n="lb"/>of teachers (Vaṃśas) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad.<sup>70</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>71</sup> refers to illicit unions of Śūdra and Ārya,
<div n="lb"/>both male and female, besides giving in its list of victims at
<div n="lb"/>the Puruṣamedha, or ‘human sacrifice,’ several whose desig-
<div n="lb"/>nations apparently mean ‘courtesan’ ({%atītvarī%})<sup>72</sup> and ‘procuress
<div n="lb"/>of abortion’ ({%atiṣkadvarī%}),<sup>73</sup> while the ‘dyeing woman’ ({%rajayitrī%})
<div n="lb"/>is dedicated to sensuality.<sup>74</sup> Pischel and Geldner also see
<div n="lb"/>many references to Hetairai in other passages of the Rigveda,<sup>75</sup>
<div n="lb"/>especially where mention is made of Uṣas, the goddess of
<div n="lb"/>Dawn, who in their view is the characteristic Hetaira. At any
<div n="lb"/>rate, there is little doubt that the ‘dancer’ ({%nṛtū%}) referred to in
<div n="lb"/>one passage of the Rigveda<sup>76</sup> was a Hetaira. When women
<div n="lb"/>are referred to as going to the {@Samana,@} or ‘place of meeting,’
<div n="lb"/>Hetairai are probably also meant.<sup>77</sup> Grave cases of immorality
<div n="lb"/>are alluded to in the Rigveda.<sup>78</sup> The love of father and
<div n="lb"/>daughter, as shown in the myth of Prajāpati,<sup>79</sup> is evidently
<div n="lb"/>censured, but the actual existence of this form of incest is
<div n="lb"/>recognized in the Atharvaveda.<sup>80</sup> Girls who had lost their
[Page1-482+ 76]
<div n="lb"/>natural protectors — father or brother<sup>81</sup> — were apt to be reduced
<div n="lb"/>to live by immorality.
<div n="P"/>{%Forms of Marriage.%} — The state of society revealed in the
<div n="lb"/>Vedic age seems to point to considerable freedom on the part
<div n="lb"/>of both man and woman in selecting a wife or a husband.
<div n="lb"/>At any rate, it is not clear that either the father or the mother
<div n="lb"/>controlled the marriage of son or daughter of mature age,<sup>82</sup>
<div n="lb"/>though no doubt the parents or parent often arranged a suit-
<div n="lb"/>able match.<sup>83</sup> The marriage was frequently arranged through
<div n="lb"/>an intermediary, the ‘wooer’ ({%vara%}),<sup>84</sup> presumably after those
<div n="lb"/>concerned had in effect come to an agreement. The sale of
<div n="lb"/>a daughter was not unknown,<sup>85</sup> but a certain amount of dis-
<div n="lb"/>credit would seem to have attached to it,<sup>86</sup> and sons-in-law in
<div n="lb"/>such cases were sometimes stingy. On the other hand, dowries
<div n="lb"/>were not infrequently given, especially no doubt when damsels
<div n="lb"/>Suffered from bodily defects.<sup>87</sup> Occasionally marriages by
[Page1-483+ 56]
<div n="lb"/>capture may have taken place, but only as knightly feats, as
<div n="lb"/>when {@Vimada@} carried off {@Purumitra's@} daughter against her
<div n="lb"/>father's wish, but very possibly with her own consent.<sup>88</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>later law-books and the Epic describe in much detail various
<div n="lb"/>forms of marriage, but they all seem reducible to three types:
<div n="lb"/>({%a%}) that which is based on mutual consent, the {%prājāpatya%}
<div n="lb"/>(‘connected with Prajāpati’); ({%b%}) that in which a price is paid
<div n="lb"/>for the bride, the {%āsura%} (‘Asura-like’), {%ārṣa%} (‘connected with
<div n="lb"/>the Ṛṣis’), {%brāhma%} (‘relating to Brahman’), or {%daiva%} (‘divine’);
<div n="lb"/>({%c%}) those which consist in stealing the bride, the {%kṣātra%}
<div n="lb"/>(‘warrior-like’) or the {%rākṣasa%} (‘demon-like’) mode, of all of
<div n="lb"/>which traces are found in Vedic literature.<sup>89</sup> For instance,
<div n="lb"/>the gift of a maiden for services rendered or other object is
<div n="lb"/>exemplified in the story of {@Cyavana@} in the Jaiminīya Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa,<sup>90</sup> and in that of {@Śyāvāśva@} in the Bṛhaddevatā.<sup>91</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%Wedding Ceremony.%} — In normal marriages the bridal was
<div n="lb"/>celebrated by an elaborate ceremony which bears in essentials
<div n="lb"/>and details the strongest resemblance to the form observed by
<div n="lb"/>other Indo-Germanic as well as non-Indo-Germanic peoples,<sup>92</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and which was destined to secure the stability and fruitfulness
<div n="lb"/>of the union. The ceremony commenced at the bride's house,<sup>93</sup>
<div n="lb"/>to which the bridegroom with his friends and relations repaired,
<div n="lb"/>and in which he met the friends and relations of the bride.<sup>94</sup>
<div n="lb"/>A cow or cows were slain for the entertainment of the guests.<sup>95</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The bridegroom having caused the bride to mount a stone,
<div n="lb"/>formally grasped her hand, and led her round the household
[Page1-484+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>fire.<sup>96</sup> This act constituted the marriage, the husband hence
<div n="lb"/>being called ‘he who takes by the hand’ ({%hasta-grābha%}).<sup>97</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>festivities being over,<sup>98</sup> the bridegroom took the bride to his
<div n="lb"/>home on a car in a marriage procession,<sup>99</sup> all to the accom-
<div n="lb"/>paniment of suitable stanzas. Then followed cohabitation.<sup>100</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%Wife's Property and Status.%} — We have very little information
<div n="lb"/>as to the legal relations of wife and husband after marriage.
<div n="lb"/>It may be assumed that the husband appropriated the wife's
<div n="lb"/>dowry, if any, as well as her earnings, if any: even in the
<div n="lb"/>Epic<sup>101</sup> the rise of the recognition of women's property as
<div n="lb"/>their own ({%strī-dhana%}) is only slow. That the husband was
<div n="lb"/>absolute master of a wife as of a slave is not probable, though
<div n="lb"/>he doubtless exercised the same power of correction as was
<div n="lb"/>expressly allowed in the eighteenth century by English law.
<div n="lb"/>The poetical ideal<sup>102</sup> of the family was decidedly high, and we
<div n="lb"/>have no reason to doubt that it was often actually fulfilled.
<div n="lb"/>Moreover, the wife on her marriage was at once given an
<div n="lb"/>honoured position in the house; she is emphatically mistress
<div n="lb"/>in her husband's home, exercising authority over her father-
<div n="lb"/>in-law, her husband's brothers, and her unmarried sisters.<sup>103</sup>
<div n="lb"/>No doubt the case contemplated is one in which the eldest son
[Page1-485+ 59]
<div n="lb"/>of a family has become its head owing to the decrepitude<sup>104</sup> of
<div n="lb"/>the parents, his wife then taking the place of the mistress
<div n="lb"/>of the joint family while the brothers and sisters are still
<div n="lb"/>unmarried. It is not inconsistent with the great stress else-
<div n="lb"/>where<sup>105</sup> laid on the respect due to a father-in-law, who then
<div n="lb"/>is probably regarded as still in full possession of his faculties,
<div n="lb"/>and controls the house while his son continues to live with
<div n="lb"/>him. The respect would no doubt equally apply if the son
<div n="lb"/>had set up a separate family of his own.<sup>106</sup>
<div n="P"/>Moreover, the wife was a regular participator in the offerings
<div n="lb"/>of the husband. In this connexion the term {@Patnī@} regularly
<div n="lb"/>applies to her in the Brāhmaṇas,<sup>107</sup> where {@Jāyā@} designates her
<div n="lb"/>in her conjugal capacity, not in that of sharer in the sacrifice.
<div n="lb"/>In this respect her position gradually deteriorated: thus the
<div n="lb"/>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>108</sup> describes a certain ceremony in which
<div n="lb"/>the wife ({%jāyā%}) alone offered the oblation in former times, while
<div n="lb"/>later a priest might do so instead. The same Brāhmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>shows other traces of a lowering in the position of women,
<div n="lb"/>probably due to the growing sense of the importance of cere-
<div n="lb"/>monial priority.<sup>109</sup> So in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā<sup>110</sup> women
<div n="lb"/>generally are classed with dice and drink as three chief evils,
<div n="lb"/>and woman is declared to be ‘untruth,’<sup>111</sup> and connected with
<div n="lb"/>Nirṛti, ‘calamity.’<sup>112</sup> A woman too, according to the Taittirīya
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitā,<sup>113</sup> is inferior even to a bad man, and a sarcastic
<div n="lb"/>reference is made in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>114</sup> to her power of
[Page1-486+ 58]
<div n="lb"/>getting things from her husband by cajolery at night. On the
<div n="lb"/>other hand must be set the encomia on woman: a woman is
<div n="lb"/>half her husband,<sup>115</sup> and completes him;<sup>116</sup> and in the Rigveda<sup>117</sup>
<div n="lb"/>attacks on women mingle with the general assumption of their
<div n="lb"/>good qualities. None the less, the Brāhmaṇas clearly indicate
<div n="lb"/>a gradual decline in their position, which is evident from the
<div n="lb"/>rule that requires the wife to eat after her husband.<sup>118</sup> Scolds
<div n="lb"/>were also known: the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>119</sup> praises the wife
<div n="lb"/>‘who does not answer back’ ({%aprativādinī%}). Women bore no
<div n="lb"/>part in political life: men go to the assembly, not women, the
<div n="lb"/>Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā<sup>120</sup> expressly says. On the other hand,
<div n="lb"/>with the advance of education, women shared in the intel-
<div n="lb"/>lectual interests of the day, as is exemplified by Yājñavalkya's<sup>121</sup>
<div n="lb"/>two wives, of whom one was interested in his philosophical
<div n="lb"/>discussions, the other not. Other women are also referred to
<div n="lb"/>in the Upaniṣads as teachers, but whether they were married
<div n="lb"/>is not certain.<sup>122</sup>
<div n="P"/>But the main object of a woman's marriage was the pro-
<div n="lb"/>duction of children, this being repeatedly asserted in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda and later.<sup>123</sup> The desire for offspring, as was natural
<div n="lb"/>in a society which mainly counted relationship through the
<div n="lb"/>father, took the form of a wish for a son to perform the
<div n="lb"/>necessary funeral rites for the father, and to continue his line.
<div n="lb"/>It was no doubt possible to adopt a son, but in the Rigveda<sup>124</sup>
<div n="lb"/>this custom is plainly viewed as unsatisfactory. The practice
[Page1-487+ 67]
<div n="lb"/>is recognized,<sup>125</sup> as we have seen above of Niyoga, in the
<div n="lb"/>appointment of a brother to beget children with the wife of
<div n="lb"/>a dead man, or perhaps of a man who is childless. ‘Sonless-
<div n="lb"/>ness’ ({%avīratā%}) is placed on the same level as lack of property
<div n="lb"/>({%amati%}), and Agni is besought to protect from it.<sup>126</sup> The birth
<div n="lb"/>of a daughter was certainly not specially welcome: the Athar-
<div n="lb"/>vaveda<sup>127</sup> in one hymn distinctly invokes the birth of a son,
<div n="lb"/>and deprecates that of a daughter, while the Aitareya Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa<sup>128</sup> contains an old verse which says that a daughter is
<div n="lb"/>a misery ({%kṛpaṇam%}), while a son is a light in the highest heaven
<div n="lb"/>({%jyotir ha putraḥ parame vyoman%}). But there is no proof that
<div n="lb"/>the Vedic Indians practised the exposure of female children.
<div n="lb"/>This conclusion, deduced from certain passages in the later
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitās<sup>129</sup> by Zimmer<sup>130</sup> and Delbrück,<sup>131</sup> has been disproved
<div n="lb"/>by Böhtlingk.
<div n="P"/>{%Child Life.%} — No doubt the care of a child was left to
<div n="lb"/>the mother, but we learn little from the earlier litera-
<div n="lb"/>ture<sup>132</sup> of the life of the young. The length of the period
<div n="lb"/>of pregnancy is frequently placed at ten (doubtless lunar)
<div n="lb"/>months.<sup>133</sup> On birth the child was first fed with milk or ghee,
<div n="lb"/>and then given the breast.<sup>134</sup> On the eighth day after birth
[Page1-488+ 78]
<div n="lb"/>the infant was washed.<sup>135</sup> The cutting of the teeth was also
<div n="lb"/>a solemn occasion,<sup>136</sup> and is the subject of a hymn in the
<div n="lb"/>Atharvaveda. Reference is also made to children's learning
<div n="lb"/>to speak, which the Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>137</sup> ascribes to the end
<div n="lb"/>of the first year of life. The Aitareya Āraṇyaka<sup>138</sup> asserts that
<div n="lb"/>the words {@Tata@} and {@Tāta,@} onomatopoetic words like ‘dada,’<sup>139</sup>
<div n="lb"/>are the first words of a child's speech, giving therein perhaps
<div n="lb"/>an unfair prominence to the father. The Atharvaveda<sup>140</sup>
<div n="lb"/>further contains at least one hymn for the ceremony of the
<div n="lb"/>first shaving of the young man's beard. The giving of a name
<div n="lb"/>was also an occasion of importance, a second one being often
<div n="lb"/>added.<sup>141</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%Satī.%} — On the death of her husband, in some cases the
<div n="lb"/>widow burned herself or was burned by his relations.<sup>142</sup> This
<div n="lb"/>is clearly implied in the reference to this ancient custom in
<div n="lb"/>the Atharvaveda.<sup>143</sup> On the other hand, the Rigveda does not
<div n="lb"/>contemplate the custom anywhere, but on the contrary con-
<div n="lb"/>siders the widow as married apparently to the brother of the
<div n="lb"/>dead man.<sup>144</sup> The custom of Suttee would therefore appear
<div n="lb"/>during the Vedic age to have been in abeyance, at least as
<div n="lb"/>a general rule. At all times the practice seems to have been
<div n="lb"/>mainly usual among families of the warrior class, to judge
<div n="lb"/>from the other Indo-Germanic parallels.<sup>145</sup> In other classes
[Page1-489+ 31]
<div n="lb"/>the survival of wives was more necessary, and the remarriage of
<div n="lb"/>widows, whether prohibited or allowed in the texts, is proof
<div n="lb"/>that there were widows who could be remarried.<sup>146</sup>

<div n="lb"/>(i. 14) also refers to such a case (see
<div n="lb"/>Bloomfield, {%Hymns of the Atharvaveda,%}
<div n="lb"/>253). The ornaments of maidens, espe-

{@Parā-vṛj@}¦ is a term found in four passages of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup>
<div n="lb"/>in all of which it refers to a person in a forlorn condition,
<div n="lb"/>while one<sup>2</sup> of them also speaks of him as going south. Sāyaṇa's<sup>3</sup>
<div n="lb"/>view that the word is a proper name is most unlikely, while
<div n="lb"/>Grassmann's<sup>4</sup> explanation of it as ‘cripple’ is still less probable.
[Page1-493+ 53]
<div n="lb"/>Roth's<sup>5</sup> interpretation of it as ‘exile’ seems clearly right in the
<div n="lb"/>passage which refers to the Parāvṛj as going south. Zimmer<sup>6</sup>
<div n="lb"/>accepts Roth's view for this passage, but in the others sees
<div n="lb"/>a reference to the child of a maiden exposed by her and in
<div n="lb"/>danger of being eaten by insects ({%vamrī%}). This view is sup-
<div n="lb"/>ported by the fact that {%parāvṛkta%} seems to have the same

<div n="lb"/>and the Brāhmaṇas explain that Agni is {%pari-kṣit%} because he

<div n="lb"/>Parikṣit in the Atharvaveda not as a human king at all. This
<div n="lb"/>may be correct, but it is not certain. Both Zimmer<sup>5</sup> and
[Page1-494+ 45]
<div n="lb"/>Oldenberg<sup>6</sup> recognize Parikṣit as a real king, a view supported
<div n="lb"/>by the fact that in the later Vedic literature King {@Janamejaya@}
<div n="lb"/>bears the patronymic {@Pārikṣita.@} If this be so, Parikṣit
<div n="lb"/>belonged to the later period, since the Atharvan passage in
<div n="lb"/>which his name occurs is certainly late, and none of the other
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitās know Parikṣit at all. The Epic<sup>7</sup> makes him grandfather
<div n="lb"/>of Pratiśravas and great-grandfather of Pratīpa, and Zimmer,<sup>5</sup>
<div n="lb"/>probably with justice, compares the Prātisutvana and Pratīpa

{@Paruṣṇī@}¦ is the name of a river which is mentioned in the
<div n="lb"/>Nadī-stuti (‘Praise of Rivers’),<sup>1</sup> and in the song of Sudās’
<div n="lb"/>victory over the ten kings,<sup>2</sup> which seems to have been made
<div n="lb"/>decisive by the rise of the river drowning the fugitives.<sup>3</sup> In
<div n="lb"/>these passages and one of the eighth book of the Rigveda,<sup>4</sup>
<div n="lb"/>where it is called a ‘great stream’ ({%mahenadi%}), the name is
<div n="lb"/>certainly that of the river later called Ravi (Irāvatī), as recog-
<div n="lb"/>nized by Yāska.<sup>5</sup> Pischel<sup>6</sup> sees a reference to it in two other
<div n="lb"/>passages of the Rigveda,<sup>7</sup> where ‘wool’ ({%ūṛṇā%}) is connected
<div n="lb"/>with the word {%paruṣṇī,%} and the allusion to the river is accepted
<div n="lb"/>by Max Müller<sup>8</sup> and Oldenberg,<sup>9</sup> though they are not fully
<div n="lb"/>agreed as to the exact sense of the passages in question.
<div n="lb"/>Pischel suggests that the name is derived from the ‘flocks’
<div n="lb"/>({%parus%}) of wool, not from the bends of the river, as understood
<div n="lb"/>by the Nirukta,<sup>5</sup> or from its reeds, as Roth<sup>10</sup> suggests.
[Page1-500+ 47]
<div n="P"/>The mention of the Paruṣṇī and the Yamunā in the hymn
<div n="lb"/>celebrating the victory of Sudās has given rise to the conjectures
<div n="lb"/>of Hopkins,<sup>11</sup> that the Yamunā in that hymn is merely another
<div n="lb"/>name for the Paruṣṇī, and of Geldner,<sup>12</sup> that the Paruṣṇī there
<div n="lb"/>is merely a tributary of the Yamunā (Jumna). But neither
<div n="lb"/>interpretation is either essential or even probable. The hymn
<div n="lb"/>is a condensed one, and may well be taken as celebrating two
<div n="lb"/>great victories of Sudās. There is a doubtful reference to the
<div n="lb"/>Paruṣṇī in the Atharvaveda.<sup>13</sup>

<F>2) vii. 18, 8. 9.</F>
<F>3) It is impossible to decide precisely
<div n="lb"/>what part the river played in the battle.
<div n="lb"/>It is usually held that the enemies of
<div n="lb"/>Sudās tried to divert the stream, but
<div n="lb"/>failed, and were drowned in its current.
<div n="lb"/>So Zimmer, {%Altindisches Leben,%} 11;
<div n="lb"/>Macdonell, {%Sanskrit Literature,%} 154;
<div n="lb"/>Geldner, {%Rigveda, Kommentar,%} 103, holds
<div n="lb"/>that Sudās was caught between two
<div n="lb"/>opposing armies, and had to escape
<div n="lb"/>over the Paruṣṇī, that his enemies
<div n="lb"/>tried to divert it to render him more
<div n="lb"/>accessible to their attack, but failed,
<div n="lb"/>and were overwhelmed in the river.
<div n="lb"/>Hopkins, {%India, Old and New,%} 52 {%et seq.,%}
<div n="lb"/>may be right in rejecting {%in toto%} the
<div n="lb"/>theory of the attempted diversion of

4. {@Parśu@}¦ occurs in one passage in a Dānastuti (‘praise of
<div n="lb"/>gifts’) in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> as the name of a man. It is not certain
<div n="lb"/>that he is identical with {@Tirindira,@} but the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta
<div n="lb"/>Sūtra<sup>2</sup> mentions Tirindira Pāraśavya as the patron of {@Vatsa@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Kāṇva.@} In another passage occurring in the Vṛṣākapi hymn,<sup>3</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Parśu Mānavī occurs, apparently as a woman, daughter of
<div n="lb"/>Manu, but who is meant it is quite impossible to say. Excepting
<div n="lb"/>these two, there are no other occurrences in which the word has
<div n="lb"/>with any probability the value of a proper name in the Rigveda.
<div n="P"/>Ludwig,<sup>4</sup> however, sees in several other places an allusion to
<div n="lb"/>the Parśus. Thus in one passage of the Rigveda<sup>5</sup> he finds a
<div n="lb"/>reference to the defeat of {@Kuruśravaṇa@} by the Parśus; in
<div n="lb"/>another<sup>6</sup> he finds a reference to the Pṛthus and Parśus — {%i.e.,%} the
<div n="lb"/>Parthians and the Persians. He also sees the Parthians in
<div n="lb"/>{@Pārthava,@} a name found in one hymn.<sup>7</sup> The same view is
<div n="lb"/>taken by Weber,<sup>8</sup> who holds that historical connexions with the
[Page1-505+ 38]
<div n="lb"/>Persians are referred to. But Zimmer<sup>9</sup> points out that this
<div n="lb"/>conclusion is not justified; the Parśus were known to Pāṇini<sup>10</sup>
<div n="lb"/>as a warrior tribe; the Pāraśavas were a tribe in south-west
<div n="lb"/>{@Madhyadeśa;@} and the {%Periplus%}<sup>11</sup> knows a tribe of Parthoi in
<div n="lb"/>north India. At most the only conclusion to be drawn is that
<div n="lb"/>the Indians and Iranians were early connected, as was of
<div n="lb"/>course the case. Actual historical contact cannot be asserted

<div n="lb"/>course, of metal,<sup>5</sup> and being sharp,<sup>6</sup> could serve on occasion as
<div n="lb"/>weapons.<sup>7</sup> The St. Petersburg Dictionary in one passage of
[Page1-508+ 54]
<div n="lb"/>the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>8</sup> takes Pavi to mean a metal rim on the
<div n="lb"/>stone for pounding Soma, but this seems improbable, because
<div n="lb"/>no such metal attachment is elsewhere alluded to. Hille-
<div n="lb"/>brandt<sup>9</sup> seems clearly right in accepting the sense of ‘sharp
<div n="lb"/>edge’ in this passage, especially as the stones in the Rigveda<sup>10</sup>
<div n="lb"/>are, in allusion to their rolling action, styled ‘rims without
<div n="lb"/>horses and without chariots’ ({%anaśvāsaḥ pavayo 'rathāḥ%}).
<div n="P"/>The Nirukta<sup>11</sup> ascribes to Pavi the sense of arrow ({%śalya%}), but
<div n="lb"/>this is very uncertain. The St. Petersburg Dictionary cites for
<div n="lb"/>this use two passages of the Rigveda,<sup>12</sup> but in one the secondary
<div n="lb"/>sense of sharp-edged weapon with reference to the bolt of Indra
<div n="lb"/>is quite likely, and in the other, where the expression {%vāṇasya%}
<div n="lb"/>{%pavi%} occurs, the sharp-edged pounding-stone of the ‘reed,’<sup>13</sup>
<div n="lb"/>meaning the stalk of the Soma plant, may be meant. Hille-
<div n="lb"/>brandt<sup>14</sup> thinks a reference to the shape of the Soma plant is
<div n="lb"/>intended. Pavī-nasa, the name of a demon mentioned in the
<div n="lb"/>Atharvaveda,<sup>15</sup> seems to throw no light on this point, for while
<div n="lb"/>the St. Petersburg Dictionary takes it to mean ‘whose nose is

<div n="lb"/>The horse and the ass are {%eka-śapha;%}<sup>17</sup> the {%kṣudra%} are the sheep,
<div n="lb"/>the goat, and the ox: this distinction being parallel to that of

<div n="lb"/>Atharvaveda<sup>20</sup> a division of wild animals ({%āraṇya%}) into five
<div n="lb"/>classes: (1) those of the jungle described as the ‘dread beasts

<div n="lb"/>creatures, represented by the {@Haṃsa,@} ‘gander,’ {@Suparṇa,@}

{@Pastyā@}¦ (fem. pl.) is a word occurring in several passages of
<div n="lb"/>the Rigveda.<sup>1</sup> Roth<sup>2</sup> ascribes to it the meaning of ‘house’ or
<div n="lb"/>‘dwelling,’ in the wide sense of the term, as well as that of the
<div n="lb"/>‘family’ living in the house; and this view is accepted by
<div n="lb"/>Zimmer.<sup>3</sup> On the other hand, Pischel<sup>4</sup> finds in two of the
<div n="lb"/>passages<sup>5</sup> usually referred to Pastyā the neuter Pastya, which
<div n="lb"/>appears in {@Pastya-sad@} and in {@Pastyā-vant@} (where the length
<div n="lb"/>of the second syllable is not primitive), and which is certainly
<div n="lb"/>found in the Rigveda<sup>6</sup> in the metaphorical sense of ‘dwelling,’
<div n="lb"/>ascribed to it in the Naighaṇṭuka.<sup>7</sup> In the other passages<sup>8</sup> he
<div n="lb"/>thinks the word means ‘rivers’ or ‘waters’; in particular,
<div n="lb"/>where Soma in the middle of the Pastyās<sup>9</sup> is spoken of, the
<div n="lb"/>sees a reference to {@Kurukṣetra,@} with its several rivers,<sup>10</sup> {@Āpayā,@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Dṛṣadvatī,@} and {@Sarasvatī@} ({%cf.%} 2. {@Pastyāvant@}). In some passages<sup>11</sup>
<div n="lb"/>he sees in Pastyā the proper name of a stream, just as Sindhu

{@Pitṛ,@}¦ common from the Rigveda onwards, denotes ‘father,’
<div n="lb"/>not so much as the ‘begetter’ ({%janitṛ%}),<sup>1</sup> but rather as the pro-
<div n="lb"/>tector of the child, this being probably also the etymological
<div n="lb"/>sense of the word.<sup>2</sup> The father in the Rigveda<sup>3</sup> stands for all
<div n="lb"/>that is good and kind. Hence Agni is compared with a father,<sup>4</sup>
<div n="lb"/>while Indra is even dearer than a father.<sup>5</sup> The father carries
<div n="lb"/>his son in his arms,<sup>6</sup> and places him on his lap,<sup>7</sup> while the child
<div n="lb"/>pulls his garment to attract attention.<sup>8</sup> In later years the son
<div n="lb"/>depends on his father for help in trouble,<sup>9</sup> and greets him
<div n="lb"/>with joy.<sup>10</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is difficult to ascertain precisely how far the son was
<div n="lb"/>subject to parental control, and how long such control con-
<div n="lb"/>tinued. Reference is made in the Rigveda<sup>11</sup> to a father's
<div n="lb"/>chastising his son for gambling, and {@Ṛjrāśva@} is said to have
<div n="lb"/>been blinded by his father.<sup>12</sup> From the latter statement
<div n="lb"/>Zimmer<sup>13</sup> infers the existence of a developed {%patria potestas,%} but
<div n="lb"/>to lay stress on this isolated and semi-mythical incident would
<div n="lb"/>be unwise. It is, however, quite likely that the {%patria potestas%}
<div n="lb"/>was originally strong, for we have other support for the thesis
<div n="lb"/>in the Roman {%patria potestas.%} If there is no proof that a father
[Page1-527+ 59]
<div n="lb"/>legally controlled his son's wedding,<sup>14</sup> and not much that he
<div n="lb"/>controlled his daughter's,<sup>15</sup> the fact is in itself not im-
<div n="lb"/>probable.
<div n="P"/>There is again no evidence to show whether a son, when
<div n="lb"/>grown up, normally continued to stay with his father, his wife
<div n="lb"/>becoming a member of the father's household, or whether he
<div n="lb"/>set up a house of his own: probably the custom varied. Nor
<div n="lb"/>do we know whether the son was granted a special plot of land
<div n="lb"/>on marriage or otherwise, or whether he only came into such
<div n="lb"/>property after his father's death. But any excessive estimate
<div n="lb"/>of the father's powers over a son who was no longer a minor
<div n="lb"/>and naturally under his control, must be qualified by the fact
<div n="lb"/>that in his old age the sons might divide their father's property,<sup>16</sup>
<div n="lb"/>or he might divide it amongst them,<sup>17</sup> and that when the
<div n="lb"/>father-in-law became aged he fell under the control of his son's
<div n="lb"/>wife.<sup>18</sup> There are also obscure traces that in old age a father
<div n="lb"/>might be exposed, though there is no reason to suppose that
<div n="lb"/>this was usual in Vedic India.<sup>19</sup>
<div n="P"/>Normally the son was bound to give his father full obedience.<sup>20</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The later Sūtras show in detail the acts of courtesy which he
<div n="lb"/>owed his father, and they allow him to eat the remnants of his
<div n="lb"/>father's food.<sup>21</sup> On the other hand, the father was expected
<div n="lb"/>to be kind. The story of {@Śunaḥśepa@} in the Aitareya Brāh-
[Page1-528+ 58]
<div n="lb"/>maṇa<sup>22</sup> emphasizes the horror with which the father's heartless
<div n="lb"/>treatment of his son was viewed. The Upaniṣads<sup>23</sup> insist on the
<div n="lb"/>spiritual succession from father to son. The kissing of a son<sup>24</sup>
<div n="lb"/>was a frequent and usual token of affection, even in mature
<div n="lb"/>years.
<div n="P"/>On the failure of natural children, adoption was possible.<sup>25</sup>
<div n="lb"/>It was even resorted to when natural children existed, but
<div n="lb"/>when it was desired to secure the presence in the family of a
<div n="lb"/>person of specially high qualifications, as in Viśvāmitra's
<div n="lb"/>adoption of Śunaḥśepa.<sup>26</sup> It is not clear that adoption from
<div n="lb"/>one caste into another was possible, for there is no good
<div n="lb"/>evidence that Viśvāmitra was, as Weber<sup>27</sup> holds, a Kṣatriya
<div n="lb"/>who adopted a Brāhmaṇa. Adoption was also not always in
<div n="lb"/>high favour: it may be accidental or not that a hymn of the
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha book of the Rigveda<sup>28</sup> condemns the usage. It was
<div n="lb"/>also possible for the father who had a daughter, but no sons,
<div n="lb"/>to appoint her to bear a son for him. At any rate the practice
<div n="lb"/>appears to be referred to in an obscure verse of the Rigveda<sup>29</sup>
<div n="lb"/>as interpreted by Yāska.<sup>30</sup> Moreover, it is possible that the
<div n="lb"/>difficulty of a brotherless maiden finding a husband<sup>31</sup> may have
<div n="lb"/>been due in part to the possibility of her father desiring to
<div n="lb"/>make her a Putrikā, the later technical name for a daughter
<div n="lb"/>whose son is to belong to her father's family.
<div n="P"/>There can be no doubt that in a family the father took
<div n="lb"/>precedence of the mother.<sup>32</sup> Delbrück<sup>33</sup> explains away the
<div n="lb"/>apparent cases to the contrary.<sup>34</sup> There is no trace of the
[Page1-529+ 74]
<div n="lb"/>family as a land-owning corporation.<sup>35</sup> The dual form Pitarau
<div n="lb"/>regularly means ‘father and mother,’ ‘parents.’<sup>36</sup>

<div n="lb"/>{%Village Communities in India,%} 1899, etc.)
<div n="lb"/>have done most to combat the view of
<div n="lb"/>the village community in India as a
<div n="lb"/>land-holding institution, is prepared to
<div n="lb"/>recognize the family as a land-owning
<div n="lb"/>unit, considering that the {%patria potestas%}
<div n="lb"/>is a later growth, and not Indian (see,
<div n="lb"/>{%e.g., Village Communities in India,%} 128
<div n="lb"/>{%et seq.%}). Hopkins, {%India, Old and New,%}
<div n="lb"/>218 {%et seq.,%} adopts a theory which allows
<div n="lb"/>of individual and joint family owner-
<div n="lb"/>ship side by side, the latter being
<div n="lb"/>apparently the earlier but the decadent
<div n="lb"/>stage. He expressly considers (p. 222)
<div n="lb"/>that the son had an indefeasible right to
<div n="lb"/>prevent the father from alienating the
<div n="lb"/>hereditary land, which could only be
<div n="lb"/>parted with by the consent of the village
<div n="lb"/>if it were a case of joint ownership
<div n="lb"/>({%cf.%} the verse cited by Jolly, {%Recht und%}
<div n="lb"/>{%Sitte,%} 94). But it must be remembered
<div n="lb"/>that, as is very clearly shown in the
<div n="lb"/>case of English law by Pollock and
<div n="lb"/>Maitland ({%History of English Law,%} 2,
<div n="lb"/>337-352), the recognition of the rights
<div n="lb"/>of sons may well be, not a sign of
<div n="lb"/>original joint or family ownership, but
<div n="lb"/>a development from the existence of
<div n="lb"/>intestate succession, and as in England,
<div n="lb"/>so in India, there is no trace of a
<div n="lb"/>corporate joint family in the early
<div n="lb"/>books. And, as Jolly ({%op. cit.,%} 76, 80)
<div n="lb"/>shows, there are clear traces, both in
<div n="lb"/>old and modern times, of a despotic
<div n="lb"/>control of the family by the father even
<div n="lb"/>after his sons grew up, provided only
<div n="lb"/>that he was physically able to control
<div n="lb"/>them. The same state of affairs seems
<div n="lb"/>proved for early English law, as it is
<div n="lb"/>beyond question for Roman law (see
<div n="lb"/>Smith's {%Dictionary of Antiquities,%} 2, 351
<div n="lb"/>{%et seq.%}). In Greece also, which is some-
<div n="lb"/>times contrasted with Rome, there is
<div n="lb"/>the clearest trace of both a real {%patria%}
<div n="lb"/>{%potestas,%} and of the absolute ownership
<div n="lb"/>of the land by the father as against
<div n="lb"/>the son, especially in the archaic laws

{@Pur@}¦ is a word of frequent occurrence in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and

<div n="lb"/>cations must have been occasionally of considerable size, as

<div n="lb"/>strongholds ‘of iron’ ({%āyasī%}) are referred to,<sup>5</sup> but these are
<div n="lb"/>probably only metaphorical. A fort ‘full of kine’ ({%gomatī%}) is
<div n="lb"/>mentioned,<sup>6</sup> showing that strongholds were used to hold cattle.
<div n="lb"/>‘Autumnal’ ({%śāradī%}) forts are named, apparently as belonging
<div n="lb"/>to the {@Dāsas:@} this may refer to the forts in that season being
[Page1-539+ 89]
<div n="lb"/>occupied against Āryan attacks or against inundations caused
<div n="lb"/>by overflowing rivers. Forts ‘with a hundred walls’ ({%śata-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%bhuji%}) are spoken of.<sup>7</sup>
<div n="P"/>It would probably be a mistake to regard these forts as
<div n="lb"/>permanently occupied fortified places like the fortresses of the
<div n="lb"/>mediæval barony. They were probably merely places of refuge
<div n="lb"/>against attack, ramparts of hardened earth with palisades and
<div n="lb"/>a ditch ({%cf.%} {@Dehī@}). Pischel and Geldner,<sup>8</sup> however, think that
<div n="lb"/>there were towns with wooden walls and ditches (<lang n="greek"></lang> and
<lang n="greek"></lang>) like the Indian town of Pāṭaliputra known to Megas-
<div n="lb"/>thenes<sup>9</sup> and the Pāli texts.<sup>10</sup> This is possible, but hardly
<div n="lb"/>susceptible of proof, and it is not without significance that the

<div n="lb"/>likely that in early Vedic times city life was much developed.
<div n="lb"/>In the Epic, according to Hopkins,<sup>11</sup> there are found the
<div n="lb"/>Nagara, ‘city’; {@Grāma,@} ‘village’; and Ghoṣa, ‘ranch.’ Vedic
<div n="lb"/>literature hardly seems to go beyond the village, no doubt with
<div n="lb"/>modifications in its later period.

<div n="lb"/>the palisade was no more than a hedge

<div n="lb"/>x. 101, 8), as suggested by Zimmer,
<div n="lb"/>{%Altindisches Leben,%} 143, 145; and {%cf.%}
<div n="lb"/>Rv. viii. 53, 5, as corrected by Roth,
<div n="lb"/>{%Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen%}
<div n="lb"/>{%Gesellschaft,%} 48, 109.
<div n="P"/>{%Cf.%} Zimmer, {%Altindisches Leben,%} 142-
<div n="lb"/>148, who compares the fact that neither
<div n="lb"/>the Germans (Tacitus, {%Germania,%} 16)
<div n="lb"/>nor the Slavs (Procopius, {%De bello Gotico,%}
<div n="lb"/>iii. 14) lived in towns, but, like the
<div n="lb"/>ancient Indians, were scattered in
<div n="lb"/>villages, each consisting of the houses
<div n="lb"/>and steadings of the several families
<div n="lb"/>living in the village. The evidence
<div n="lb"/>seems pretty convincing. It is true
<div n="lb"/>that the Greeks, when we first find
<div n="lb"/>them, evidently knew castles and for-
<div n="lb"/>tresses of the mediæval type; but the
<div n="lb"/>Greeks were clearly an invading race,
<div n="lb"/>superimposed on an older and in
<div n="lb"/>civilization more advanced people (see,
<div n="lb"/>{%e.g.,%} Burrows, {%Discoveries in Crete%}). But
<div n="lb"/>the Pur may, as Zimmer allows, have
<div n="lb"/>sometimes been built within the limits
<div n="lb"/>of the village. Whether, as he urges
<div n="lb"/>(144), the {%śāradī pur%} was a protection
<div n="lb"/>against the floods of autumn is un-
<div n="lb"/>certain. {%Cf.%} Rv. i. 131, 4; 174, 2;
<div n="lb"/>vi. 20, 10. In particular, it is not
<div n="lb"/>legitimate to connect the mention of
<div n="lb"/>those forts with the fact that the Pūrus
<div n="lb"/>lived on either side of the Sindhu
<div n="lb"/>(Indus), and to assume that Purukutsa's
<div n="lb"/>attack on the aborigines was directed
<div n="lb"/>against the forts in which they normally
<div n="lb"/>protected themselves on the rising of
<div n="lb"/>the river. No argument for the large
<div n="lb"/>size of cities can be drawn from the
<div n="lb"/>mention in the Kāṭhaka Upaniṣad, v. 1,
<div n="lb"/>of {%ekādaśa-dvāra%} as an epithet of Pura
<div n="lb"/>({%cf.%} Śvetāśvatara Upaniśad, iii. 18;
<div n="lb"/>{%nava-dvāra pura,%} ‘the citadel of nine
<div n="lb"/>doors’), because it is used meta-
<div n="lb"/>phorically of the body, and the number
<div n="lb"/>of doors depends on the nature of the
<div n="lb"/>body (Keith, {%Aitareya Āraṇyaka,%} 185).
<div n="lb"/>The evidence of the Śatapatha Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa, xi. 1, 1, 2, 3, seems rather to
<div n="lb"/>point to only one gate in a city.

{@Puru-kutsa@}¦ is the name of a king who is mentioned several

<div n="lb"/>Ludwig,<sup>2</sup> or merely as a contemporary, according to Hille-
<div n="lb"/>brandt,<sup>3</sup> is uncertain. In two other passages<sup>4</sup> he is mentioned
<div n="lb"/>as victorious by divine favour, and in another<sup>5</sup> he appears as a
<div n="lb"/>king of the {@Pūrus@} and a conqueror of the {@Dāsas.@} His son was
<div n="lb"/>{@Trasadasyu,@}<sup>6</sup> who is accordingly called {@Paurukutsya@}<sup>7</sup> or
<div n="lb"/>{@Paurukutsi.@}<sup>8</sup> Different conclusions have been drawn from one
<div n="lb"/>hymn of the Rigveda<sup>9</sup> in which the birth of Purukutsa's son,
[Page1-542+ 44]
<div n="lb"/>Trasadasyu, is mentioned. The usual interpretation is that
<div n="lb"/>Purukutsa was killed in battle or captured, whereupon his
<div n="lb"/>wife secured a son to restore the fortunes of the Pūrus. But
<div n="lb"/>Sieg<sup>10</sup> offers a completely different interpretation. According
<div n="lb"/>to him the word {@daurgahe,@} which occurs in the hymn, and
<div n="lb"/>which in the ordinary view is rendered ‘descendant of Durgaha,’
<div n="lb"/>an ancestor of Purukutsa, is the name of a horse, the hymn
<div n="lb"/>recording the success of an Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’)
<div n="lb"/>undertaken by Purukutsa for his wife, as by kings in later
<div n="lb"/>times, to secure a son. This interpretation is supported by the
<div n="lb"/>version of {%daurgahe%} given in the Śatapatha,<sup>11</sup> but is by no
<div n="lb"/>means certain. Moreover, if Purukutsa was a contemporary of
<div n="lb"/>Sudās, the defeat of the Pūrus by Sudās in the {@Dāśarājña@}<sup>12</sup>
<div n="lb"/>might well have been the cause of the troubles from which
<div n="lb"/>{@Purukutsānī,@} by the birth of Trasadasyu, rescued the family.

<div n="lb"/>in the Rigveda,<sup>4</sup> where, according to the legends reported in
<div n="lb"/>the Bṛhaddevatā<sup>5</sup> and by Ṣaḍguruśiṣya in his commentary on
<div n="lb"/>the Sarvānukramaṇī,<sup>6</sup> and by Sāyaṇa in his commentary on the

<H>{@FOREWORD@}
<P>Messrs Motilal Banarsidas are to be congratulated on
<>bringing out this edition of Macdonald and Keith's Vedic Index
<>of names and subjects. This is a very useful compilation and
<>every student of Vedic literature finds it invaluable. It is much
<>more than what its name implies. There are illuminating notes
<>on a variety of subjects, Civil Law for instance, which supply
<>the background without which an exegesis of Vedic texts, inclu-
<>ding in the term the compendia of religion, ritual, tradition and
<>philosophy known as Brahamanas would not be possible. It is
<>not necessary to accept all the theses which the learned authors
<>have laid down for themselves. For instance, they are not
<>prepared to believe that Vedic literature is much earlier than
<>1200 B.C. for reasons which are not very difficult to understand.
<>Western scholars find it difficult to accord Indian culture and
<>civilization an antiquity as great as that of the Egyptians. They
<>are not prepared to admit, as Macdonald specifically states in
<>his preface, that the cult of Vedic gods like Indra, Varuna and
<>the Nasatyas could have travelled from India to Middle Asia.
<>For them the researches of Tilak and other Indian scholars who
<>find internal evidence in Vedic literature itself to carry Vedic
<>chronology back by several centuries and of an Aryan culture,
<>though not necessarily an Aryan race, rooted firmly in Indian
<>soil and sending out its off shoots to countries further west, have
<>no meaning. Normally, perhaps, such differences in matters
<>apparently of purely an academic interest should not affect
<>the value of a book like the present Index. But, it can easily be
<>seen that at times the interpretation of particular terms would
<>be affected by such considerations. To take the word ‘Sindhu’
<>by way of example, a person who is wedded to the theory of
<>the Central Asian origin of Aryan culture cannot but translate
<>the word as river. Obviously, there are no oceans in Central
<>Asia. On the other hand, a scholar who is convinced that the
<>original home of the Aryans as we know them in the Rig Veda
[Page1-ii+ 18]
<>was in the Sapta Sindhav region and who, at the same time,
<>take cognisance of recent researches in the geology of ancient
<>India, will probably be forced to the conclusion that several

<H>PREFACE
<P>{@Inception and Progress of the Book.@} — The origination of the
<>present work was due to Professor T. W. Rhys Davids at the
<>time when, several years ago, he was appointed general editor
<>of the Indian Text Series to be published under the auspices
<>of the Secretary of State for India. He then asked me to
<>contribute a work supplying the historical material, as repre-
<>sented by proper names, to be found in the earliest period of
<>Indian literature antecedent to the rise of Buddhism towards
<>the close of the sixth century B.C. Since the subject came
<>within the range of my special studies and moreover appeared
<>to be one of considerable importance, I agreed to the proposal.
<>But I did so with hesitation, because my leisure for a long time
<>to come was already mortgaged by two works which involved
<>much labour and on which I was already engaged. I soon
<>came to the conclusion that till those works — the {%Bṛhaddevatā%}
<>and the {%Vedic Grammar%} — were out of my hands, I could spare
<>no time for the third book, the mere preparation, to say nothing
<>of the publication, of which would thus have to be postponed
<>for several years. Another hindrance would be caused by the
<>tour of study and research in India which I contemplated making
<>at the earliest opportunity. With the prospect of these long
<>delays before me, I was tempted to throw up a task that seemed
<>to have been rashly undertaken. At the same time, I was re-
<>luctant either to abandon or to put off indefinitely what I had
<>once begun. It also seemed a pity to relinquish an enterprise
<>which, if properly carried out, promised to be very useful.
[Page1-vi+ 34]
<NI>Under these circumstances, collaboration appeared the only
<>way out of the difficulty. I bethought myself of Mr. A. B.
<>Keith, who, as Boden Sanskrit scholar, had been my pupil for
<>four years, and who had already assisted me since 1899, not
<>only by reading the proofs of, but by suggesting improvements
<>in, my {%History of Sanskrit Literature%} and my {%Sanskrit Grammar%}
<>{%for Beginners,%} as well as my edition of the {%Bṛhaddevatā,%} then
<>commencing to be printed. I accordingly asked him if he had
<>the time and inclination to collaborate with me in the proposed
<>work by at once beginning to collect material for it. He con-
<>sented without hesitation, and the Secretary of State for India
<>readily sanctioned this modification of the arrangements already
<>made. There was no other man to whom I could have en-
<>trusted with such complete confidence the task of carrying out
<>this preliminary work accurately and rapidly.
<P>In 1909, about a year after my return from India, Mr. Keith
<>supplied me with a considerable part of his collectanea, while
<>my {%Vedic Grammar%} was still passing through the press. The
<>regular printing did not begin till early in 1910, about the time
<>when that work was published. The interval was taken up
<>with preparing a sufficient amount of ‘copy’ for the printer,
<>as well as with settling various questions of arrangement and
<>typography.
<P>{@Mode of Collaboration.@} — Our respective shares in the pro-
<>duction of the book are, generally stated, as follows: Dr. Keith
<>has collected the material, while I have acted chiefly as an
<>editor, planning the scope of the work, arranging the distribu-
<>tion of text and notes, selecting the type to be used, cutting
<>out, adding to or modifying the matter, weighing the evidence
<>for different interpretations and conclusions, and deciding as to
<>which view, in case of possible alternatives, should be preferred.
<>Having written up in its final form every article contained in
<>the book, I accept the responsibility for every statement and
<>opinion expressed in it. I do not think that Dr. Keith and I
<>have disagreed upon any material point. When we have differed
[Page1-vii+ 35]
<>on minor questions, he has deferred to my judgment, though
<>his view may have been right just as often as mine. Where
<>erroneous conclusions have been drawn, the reader will be
<>helped to correct them by the method I have pursued of
<>supplying from the original texts the evidence on which such
<>conclusions are based.
<P>{@Scope of the Work.@} — At the outset it was proposed, as I
<>have already stated, that the book should furnish the historical
<>material in Vedic literature as represented by proper names.
<>As soon, however, as I began to examine more carefully the
<>historical material thus available, I became convinced that
<>restriction to proper names would result in a harvest too
<>meagre to deserve being gathered in the form of a book. It
<>seemed essential to collect all the historical matter accessible
<>to us in the earliest literary documents of India, and thus to
<>furnish a conspectus of the most ancient phase of Aryan
<>civilization that can be realized by direct evidence. If properly
<>and thoroughly treated this matter would, I felt sure, yield a
<>book of genuine value, a comprehensive work on Vedic antiqui-
<>ties; for it would include all the information that can be
<>extracted from Vedic literature on such topics as agriculture,
<>astronomy, burial, caste, clothing, crime, diseases, economic
<>conditions, food and drink, gambling, kingship, law and justice,
<>marriage, morality, occupations, polyandry and polygamy, the
<>position of women, usury, village communities, war, wedding
<>ceremonies, widow burning, witchcraft, and many others. The
<>proper names would embrace not only persons, tribes, and
<>peoples, but also mountains, rivers, and countries. The geo-
<>graphical distribution of the Vedic population would thus also
<>be presented.
<P>From the historical data amplified in this way I proposed,
<>however, to exclude matter belonging to the domain of religion,
<>which it seemed better to relegate to a separate work. At the
<>same time it soon became clear that certain aspects of religious
<>activity inseparably connected with the social and political life
[Page1-viii+ 35]
<>of the age would have to be admitted, such as the functions of
<>the main priests and some festivals or ritual practices. Again,
<>certain names of perhaps purely mythological figures might
<>have to be mentioned. The evidence is occasionally insufficient
<>to show whether a name represents an actual historical person-
<>age: a demon or a mythical hero or priest may be meant. An
<>undoubted demon may even have to be included, such as the
<>one that is supposed to cause eclipses, because he belongs to
<>the domain of primitive astronomy.
<P>{@Chronological Limits.@} — The period which the book was
<>intended to embrace had been decided at the outset as that
<>of the Vedas and Brāhmaṇas. The upper limit here is the date
<>of the oldest hymns of the Rigveda. That date is uncertain, but
<>my conviction (set forth in my {%History of Sanskrit Literature,%}
<>pp. 11-12) that it is not much earlier than 1200 B.C. still remains
<>unshaken. It does not appear to me to be in the slightest degree
<>invalidated by Professor Hugo Winckler's discoveries at Bo-
<>ghaz-köi, in Asia Minor, in the year 1907. That scholar has
<>deciphered, in an inscription of about 1400 B.C. found there, the
<>names of certain deities as {%mi-it-ra, uru-w-na, in-da-ra,%} and {%na-%}
<>{%ša-at-ti-ia,%} which correspond to those of the important Vedic
<>gods Mitra, Varuṇa, Indra, and Nāsatya. Three inferences may
<>be drawn from the occurrence of these names. They may have
<>been derived from Vedic India; in that case the Vedic religion
<>must have flourished in India considerably before 1400 B.C.,
<>even though the hymns that have come down to us may not
<>have been composed before that date. But that these names
<>should have travelled all the way from India to Asia Minor
<>is a hypothesis so highly improbable that it may be dismissed.
<>Secondly, the names may belong to the early Iranian period
<>after the Iranians had separated from the Indians, but before
<>their language had reached the phonetic stage of the Avesta.
<>This seems the most probable theory, both chronologically and
<>geographically. It implies only that the Indian branch had
<>separated from the Iranian, not that it had already entered
[Page1-ix+ 35]
<>India. Lastly, the names, being common to the Iranian and
<>Indian languages, might be assigned to the Indo-Iranian period
<>when the two branches were still one people living in Iran.
<>This theory would still allow two centuries for separation,
<>migration to India, and the commencement of Vedic literature
<>in the north-west of India.
<P>The lower limit of the Vedic period is the epoch of the rise
<>and spread of Buddhism, or, roughly, 500 B.C. The Brāhmaṇa
<>literature to be exploited was assumed to be undoubtedly
<>anterior to that date. The boundary line would, however, to
<>some extent have to be overstepped by drawing on the Sūtras
<>for evidence where the Vedas and Brāhmaṇas fail. But though
<>the Sūtras are roughly contemporaneous with the first three
<>centuries of Buddhism, they are practically an epitome of the
<>practices of the Brāhmaṇa period, and are thus often of great
<>value in illustration or corroboration of the facts of that period.
<>They are also important as representing the Brahminical
<>evidence for those three centuries, especially as it is somewhat
<>uncertain how far even the earliest Buddhist literary sources
<>go back in an authentic form to the three centuries following the
<>death of Buddha. Names and practices not referred to before
<>the Sūtras were, however, to be mentioned only incidentally
<>if at all: the few cases to the contrary that actually occur are
<>not real exceptions, because they are derived from Vedic verses
<>quoted in Sūtras, or from Brāhmaṇa parts of Sūtras such as
<>Baudhāyana.
<P>{@Method Pursued.@} — Such was the scope of the work on which
<>I finally decided before it was begun, and the plan has been
<>adhered to in its execution as regards the contents. The
<>manner in which those contents were to be presented was
<>the next question to be settled and acted upon. Though both
<>Dr. Keith and myself are familiar with the literature of the
<>Vedic period from which the facts collected in these two
<>volumes are drawn, and the mutual check exercised by two
<>workers sifting the same material acts as a safeguard, it is
[Page1-x+ 35]
<>nevertheless not always possible to exclude the risk of error
<>or unconscious bias in estimating evidence often obscure and
<>doubtful. I have, therefore, throughout attached great im-
<>portance to stating not only the evidence of the texts them-
<>selves from a first-hand knowledge, but also to setting forth
<>fully the opinions of other authorities when the interpretation
<>is uncertain. The Sanskrit scholar will thus be enabled to
<>test without difficulty the correctness of the conclusions drawn
<>directly from the original sources, while others will be protected
<>from having to rely exclusively on what may possibly be one-
<>sided views. Articles have often been illustrated by adducing
<>parallels from the institutions of cognate Āryan nations, as that
<>on ‘Caste’ (treated under {@Varṇa,@} ii. 427-471). I have further
<>endeavoured to utilize, chiefly in the notes, knowledge gained
<>from a first-hand study of the archæological remains and of
<>the modern conditions of India. Such knowledge, acquired
<>during my tour in 1907-08, I have found to be of great value
<>to me both as a student and as a teacher.
<P>{@Arrangement.@} — The matter contained in these volumes is
<>treated not in chapters, but in articles disposed in alphabetical
<>order. That order was practically necessary when proper
<>names only were to be included; when subjects were sub-
<>sequently added to the plan, it still remained the most con-
<>venient method of arrangement. As all articles appear under
<>Sanskrit words, the order which the latter follow is naturally
<>that of the Sanskrit alphabet. This arrangement need, how-
<>ever, occasion no inconvenience to those users of the book who
<>are unfamiliar with Sanskrit, because all the information they
<>want can be found by reference to the full English Index at the
<>end of Vol. ii. The Sanskrit Index, which contains, in addition
<>to the terms representing the subjects treated, all incidental
<>Sanskrit words occurring in the articles, is of course arranged
<>in the Sanskrit order. For the purpose of obviating any possible
<>inconvenience, the sequence of the Sanskrit alphabet is given
<>on the last page of this preface. With the same end in view I
[Page1-xi+ 35]
<>have given translations or explanations of all Sanskrit words
<>and expressions, because the latter, though generally clear to
<>Sanskrit scholars, would be unintelligible to others. Compound
<>Sanskrit words have been divided into their component parts by
<>the use of hyphens. In the case of obscure or irregularly formed
<>Sanskrit words, I have sometimes added etymological explana-
<>tions, which may be useful even to the Sanskrit scholar.
<P>I have long had a rooted objection to crowding the letter-
<>press of a book with parentheses containing a string of references
<>or incidental explanations, because these distract the attention
<>of the reader and interfere with his grasping the argument
<>rapidly. I have accordingly in the present work (as in several
<>previous ones) cleared the text of such obstructive matter,
<>relegating references and minor explanations, illustrations, or
<>discussions, to the notes. The sole exceptions are short
<>references consisting of figures only, and occurring in articles
<>of two or three lines in length. Thus, in the article ‘Kauṣārava’
<>(i. 194), the figures (viii. 28) are added in parentheses at the
<>end of the line. To have made a footnote out of these figures
<>alone would have been a pedantic and an absurd application
<>of the general principle.
<P>The {@notes@} are placed in two columns, because this arrange-
<>ment enables the reader to find them more rapidly than any
<>other. They come at the end of, and immediately below, each
<>article. It is only when the article is a long one extending
<>beyond the first page that the notes do not all occupy this
<>position. Those referring to each page are then placed at the
<>foot of that page, and only those referring to the last page come
<>at the end of the article ({%cf., e.g.,%} 1. {@Akṣa@}).
<P>The {@headlines@} are so arranged as to help the reader in finding
<>what he wants quickly, as well as to convey the maximum of
<>information. A glance at the inner corners at the top will
<>show the alphabetical range of the articles occurring in any
<>two pages, the one indicating the first word on the left page,
<>the other the last word on the right page. The rest of the
[Page1-xii+ 35]
<>neadline of each page supplies a summary of the contents of
<>that page. I have never been able to find any rational ex-
<>planation why the title of the book held in one's hand should
<>be printed at the top of at least half, sometimes of all, the
<>pages it contains. How this practice can possibly assist the
<>reader is hard to understand.
<P>{@Typographical Details.@} — Every Sanskrit word used as the
<>title of an article is printed in thick type for the purpose of
<>catching the eye of the reader more readily. Every such word
<>mentioned in another article is on its first occurrence there
<>similarly printed. This is both a simpler and a clearer way of
<>referring to a word used in another place than the employ-
<>ment of parentheses and additional words or abbreviations, like
<>‘see’ or {%‘cf.,’%} which tend to distract the attention of the reader
<>(see, {%e.g.,%} {@Agastya@}). Both Sanskrit names (including titles of
<>books) and ordinary Sanskrit terms used as English words are
<>printed in Roman type, but then always with a capital ({%e.g.,%}
<>Purohita). Italic type is employed for Sanskrit words quoted
<>as such, for expressions from other languages such as Latin or
<>French, for the titles of all except Sanskrit books ({%e.g.,%} Olden-
<>berg, {%Buddha%}), and even of Sanskrit books when a particulal
<>edition is intended (thus Roth, {%Nirukta,%} but Yāska, Nirukta).
<>English words are italicized only when in long articles the
<>titles of subdivisions are given. All these uses of italics will
<>be found exemplified in the articles 2. {@Akṣa@} and 3. {@Akṣa.@}
<P>As regards numerals, Roman figures are employed to indicate
<>the main divisions of a work, the subordinate parts being
<>expressed by Arabic figures. Thus ‘Rigveda, ii. 3, 5,’ means
<>‘book 2, hymn 3, verse 5.’ The volume, on the other hand,
<>is referred to by an Arabic numeral, the following figure
<>indicating the page. Thus ‘Max Müller, {%Ṛgveda,%} 2, 135’
<>means ‘volume 2 of Max Müller's edition of the Rigveda,
<>page 135.’
<P>I have avoided abbreviating the titles of books or journals
<>even when they occur often, or are mentioned in the notes
[Page1-xiii+ 35]
<>only. Contracted titles are as a rule intelligible to the general
<>reader only by reference to an explanatory list appearing at
<>the beginning or the end of a book. When a work is written
<>consecutively, such an abbreviation can be looked up on its
<>first occurrence, and as it is usually met with again at short
<>intervals its explanation will be remembered. But in a book
<>arranged in dictionary form, the occurrence of abridged titles
<>becomes irksome to the reader because he meets them at any
<>part of the book he opens, and often many at the same time;
<>he will probably therefore be continually consulting the ex-
<>planatory list. Hence I have only admitted the contractions
<>‘Rv.’ for Rigveda and ‘Av.’ for Atharvaveda, as these texts are
<>constantly referred to, often several times in the same article.
<>In some works, such as the {%Encyclopœdia of Indo-Āryan Research,%}
<>excessively contracted titles, frequently assuming the appear-
<>ance of algebraic symbols, become necessary owing to the great
<>mass of bibliographical references required. In the present
<>work such economy of space was in no way called for. If,
<>however, the book had been intended for the use of Sanskrit
<>scholars only, I should certainly have shortened many titles
<>here given in full, for there are numerous formulaic abbrevia-
<>tions that are familiar to all specialists.
<P>{@Transliteration.@} — The system here followed is that which
<>has been adopted by the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain
<>and Ireland, and is generally employed elsewhere also. The
<>chief difficulties caused to the non-scholar by this method of
<>reproducing Sanskrit words are due, on the one hand, to the
<>inadequacy of the Roman alphabet, which necessitates the use
<>of diacritical marks, and, on the other, to the conventional use
<>of two consonants in English, in certain cases, to represent a
<>single sound, as {%ch, sh, ph,%} and {%th.%} The letter {%ṣ%} here is the
<>equivalent of {%sh%} in ‘shun’; {%ś%} is somewhat thinner in pro-
<>nunciation, like the {%ss%} in ‘session’; {%ṃ%} resembles the {%n%} in the
<>French ‘bon’; and {%ḥ%} the German {%ch%} in ‘ach.’ The palatal {%c%}
<>is to be sounded like the initial {%ch%} in Churchill; {%ch%} has an
[Page1-xiv+ 35]
<>aspirate sound like that of the {%ch%} in the middle of the same
<>word; {%ph%} and {%th%} are also aspirates, as in the English ‘up-hill’
<>and ‘ant-hill’ respectively. The vowels must all be pro-
<>nounced as in Italian: short when unmarked (except {%e%} and {%o,%}
<>which are always long), long when they have a horizontal
<>stroke above; thus {%i%} is sounded as in ‘pin,’ {%ī%} like {%ee%} in ‘seen.’
<>The vowel {%ṛ%} may be pronounced like {%ri%} in ‘risk.’
<P>{@The Map.@} — In order that the reader may be enabled to
<>visualize in a general way the territory known to and occupied
<>by the Vedic tribes, I have prefixed to the first volume a map
<>of Vedic India. Here the home of the Indo-Aryans of the
<>earliest period — that of the Rigveda — is the territory drained
<>by the Indus river system, lying between the 35th and 28th
<>parallel of northern latitude and between 70º and 78º eastern
<>longitude, and corresponding roughly to the North-West
<>Frontier Province and the Panjab of the present day. The
<>eastern limit was probably the Yamunā, though the Ganges
<>was already known. In the subsequent Vedic period — that
<>of the later Vedas and of the Brāhmaṇas — the Indo-Āryan
<>settlers gradually occupied the whole of the Ganges Valley
<>down to the delta of that river. But the home of the fully
<>developed culture of the Brāhmaṇas lay in the territory ex-
<>tending in a south-easterly direction from longitude 74º to
<>85º, between the confluence of the Sarasvatī and Dṛṣadvatī
<>in the west and that of the Sadānīrā and Ganges on the east,
<>and embracing roughly the south-eastern portion of the Panjab
<>and the United Provinces of to-day. East of longitude 85º
<>lay, to the north and south of the Ganges, the imperfectly
<>Brahminized country corresponding to the modern Tirhut and
<>Bihār, where Buddhism arose at the end of the Vedic period.
<P>I ought to warn readers against placing too much reliance
<>on the details of this map, because it is largely conjectural
<>owing to the lack of precise geographical statement in the
<>texts. The student, when using it, should always refer to the
<>evidence furnished by the articles under each name that appears
[Page1-xv+ 35]
<>on the map. The identification of many of the Vedic rivers
<>with those of modern India is certain; but even here the exact
<>channels in which they flowed in ancient times is doubtful.
<>Thus the Indus, some of the Panjab rivers, and the old
<>Sarasvatī have been shown by Raverty, in an article in the
<>{%Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal%} for 1892, to have changed
<>their courses considerably, even within historical times. It
<>must be remembered that all the rivers of Vedic India traversed
<>the alluvial plains of the north, and were, therefore, unlike the
<>rivers of the Deccan, which flow in rocky beds, liable to constant
<>fluctuations in their channels. Again, the Vedic tribes are
<>nearly always mentioned so vaguely in the texts that they can
<>only be approximately located by the rivers with which they
<>are connected, or by the way in which their names are asso-
<>ciated or grouped. Many such names had to be omitted
<>altogether in the map because of the total lack of evidence
<>for their localization. Some help may be obtained from the
<>geographical position in the post-Vedic period of tribes men-
<>tioned in Vedic literature. But this evidence is apt to be
<>doubtful, because the Vedic period was largely one of migra-
<>tion, and various tribes may then have occupied localities
<>much farther north or west than those in which they were
<>later permanently settled. The general evidence of the map,
<>however uncertain many of the details may be, leaves no room
<>for doubt as to the route by which the Āryans entered India,
<>or as to the direction of the successive stages of the migration
<>by which they eventually spread their civilization over the
<>whole of the peninsula.
<P>{@Conclusion.@} — The first volume was ready for issue more than
<>a year ago, but to publish it without the indexes, which would
<>necessarily have to appear at the end of the second volume,
<>seemed to me to be perfectly useless. I therefore preferred
<>to wait till the whole book could be brought out in a complete
<>form. As both Dr. Keith and myself have each read one proof
<>and nearly always two revises of every sheet before it went to
[Page1-xvi+ 12]
<>press, all but trivial errors and misprints ought to have been
<>eliminated. I hope, however, that these two volumes will
<>prove to be not only correct in form, but also valuable in
<>matter, after our joint efforts to bring together and present
<>their contents in a convenient and trustworthy manner.

{@Puro-hita@}¦ (‘placed in front,’ ‘appointed’) is the name of a
<div n="lb"/>priest in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later.<sup>2</sup> The office of Purohita is
<div n="lb"/>called Purohiti<sup>3</sup> and {@Purodhā.@} It is clear that the primary
<div n="lb"/>function of the Purohita was that of ‘domestic priest’ of a
<div n="lb"/>king, or perhaps a great noble; his quite exceptional position
<div n="lb"/>is shown by the fact that only one Purohita seems ever to be
<div n="lb"/>mentioned in Vedic literature.<sup>4</sup> Examples of Purohitas in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda are {@Viśvāmitra@}<sup>5</sup> or {@Vasiṣṭha@}<sup>6</sup> in the service of the
<div n="lb"/>{@Bharata@} king; {@Sudās,@} of the {@Tṛtsu@} family; the Purohita of
<div n="lb"/>{@Kuruśravaṇa;@}<sup>7</sup> and {@Devāpi,@} the Purohita of {@Śantanu.@}<sup>8</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>Purohita was in all religious matters the {%alter ego%} of the king.
<div n="lb"/>In the ritual<sup>9</sup> it is laid down that a king must have a Purohita,
<div n="lb"/>else the gods will not accept his offerings. He ensures the
<div n="lb"/>king's safety and victory in battle by his prayers;<sup>10</sup> he procures
[Page2-006+ 56]
<div n="lb"/>the fall of rain for the crops;<sup>11</sup> he is the flaming fire that
<div n="lb"/>guards the kingdom.<sup>12</sup> Divodāsa in trouble is rescued by
<div n="lb"/>Bharadvāja;<sup>13</sup> and King {@Tryaruṇa Traidhātva Aikṣvāka@}
<div n="lb"/>reproaches his Purohita, {@Vṛśa Jāna,@} when his car runs over
<div n="lb"/>a Brahmin boy and kills him.<sup>14</sup> The close relation of king and
<div n="lb"/>Purohita is illustrated by the case of {@Kutsa Aurava,@} who slew
<div n="lb"/>his Purohita, {@Upagu Sauśravasa,@} for disloyalty in serving
<div n="lb"/>Indra, to whom Kutsa was hostile.<sup>15</sup> Other disputes between
<div n="lb"/>kings and priests who officiated for them are those of {@Janam-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@ejaya@} and the {@Kaśyapas,@} and of {@Viśvantara@} and the {@Śyā-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@parṇas;@}<sup>16</sup> and between {@Asamāti@} and the {@Gaupāyanas.@}<sup>17</sup> In
<div n="lb"/>some cases one Purohita served more than one king; for
<div n="lb"/>example, {@Devabhāga Śrautarṣa@} was the Purohita of the
<div n="lb"/>{@Kurus@} and the {@Sṛṅjayas@} at the same time,<sup>18</sup> and {@Jala Jātū-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@karṇya@} was the Purohita of the kings of {@Kāśi, Videha,@} and
<div n="lb"/>{@Kosala.@}<sup>19</sup>
<div n="P"/>There is no certain proof that the office of Purohita was
<div n="lb"/>hereditary in a family, though it probably was so.<sup>20</sup> At any
<div n="lb"/>rate, it seems clear from the relations of the Purohita with
<div n="lb"/>King {@Kuruśravaṇa,@} and with his son {@Upamaśravas,@}<sup>21</sup> that a
<div n="lb"/>king would keep on the Purohita of his father.
<div n="P"/>Zimmer<sup>22</sup> thinks that the king might act as his own Purohita,
<div n="lb"/>as shown by the case of King Viśvantara, who sacrificed with-
<div n="lb"/>out the help of the Śyāparṇas,<sup>23</sup> and that a Purohita need not
<div n="lb"/>be a priest, as shown by the case of Devāpi and Śantanu.<sup>24</sup>
<div n="lb"/>But neither opinion seems to be justified. It is not said that
[Page2-007+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>Viśvantara sacrificed without priests, while Devāpi is not
<div n="lb"/>regarded as a king until the Nirukta,<sup>25</sup> and there is no
<div n="lb"/>reason to suppose that Yāska's view expressed in that work
<div n="lb"/>is correct.
<div n="P"/>According to Geldner,<sup>26</sup> the Purohita from the beginning
<div n="lb"/>acted as the Brahman priest in the sacrificial ritual, being
<div n="lb"/>there the general superintendent of the sacrifice. In favour of
<div n="lb"/>this view, he cites the fact that Vasiṣṭha is mentioned both as
<div n="lb"/>Purohita<sup>27</sup> and as Brahman:<sup>28</sup> at the sacrifice of {@Śunaḥśepa@} he
<div n="lb"/>served as Brahman,<sup>29</sup> but he was the Purohita of Sudās;<sup>30</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaspati is called the Purohita<sup>31</sup> and the Brahman<sup>32</sup> of the
<div n="lb"/>gods; and the Vasiṣṭhas who are Purohitas are also the Brah-
<div n="lb"/>mans at the sacrifice.<sup>33</sup> It is thus clear that the Brahman was
<div n="lb"/>often the Purohita; and it was natural that this should be the
<div n="lb"/>case when once the Brahman's place became, as it did in the
<div n="lb"/>later ritual, the most important position at the sacrifice.<sup>34</sup> But
<div n="lb"/>the Brahman can hardly be said to have held this place in the
<div n="lb"/>earlier ritual; Oldenberg<sup>35</sup> seems to be right in holding that
<div n="lb"/>the Purohita was originally the Hotṛ priest, the singer {%par%}
<div n="lb"/>{%excellence,%} when he took any part at all in the ritual of the great
<div n="lb"/>sacrifices with the {@Ṛtvijs.@} So Devāpi seems clearly to have
[Page2-008+ 54]
<div n="lb"/>been a Hotṛ;<sup>36</sup> Agni is at once Purohita<sup>37</sup> and Hotṛ;<sup>38</sup> and the
<div n="lb"/>‘two divine Hotṛs’ referred to in the Āprī litanies are also
<div n="lb"/>called the ‘two Purohitas.’<sup>39</sup> Later, no doubt, when the
<div n="lb"/>priestly activity ceased to centre in the song, the Purohita, with
<div n="lb"/>his skill in magic, became the Brahman, who also required
<div n="lb"/>magic to undo the errors of the sacrifice.<sup>40</sup>
<div n="P"/>There is little doubt that in the original growth of the priest-
<div n="lb"/>hood the Purohita played a considerable part. In historical
<div n="lb"/>times he represented the real power of the kingship, and may
<div n="lb"/>safely be deemed to have exercised great influence in all public
<div n="lb"/>affairs, such as the administration of justice and the king's
<div n="lb"/>conduct of business. But it is not at all probable that the
<div n="lb"/>Purohita represents, as Roth<sup>41</sup> and Zimmer<sup>42</sup> thought, the
<div n="lb"/>source which gave rise to caste. The priestly class is already
<div n="lb"/>in existence in the Rigveda (see {@Varṇa@}).

<div n="lb"/>who gives the tale of the Gaupāyanas
<div n="lb"/>and King Asamāti from the Śāṭyāya-
<div n="lb"/>naka, and comparing the case of
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra as Purohitas,
<div n="lb"/>probably contemporaneously, of Sudās.
<div n="lb"/>But that the two were contemporaneous
<div n="lb"/>is most unlikely, especially if we adopt
<div n="lb"/>the very probable view of Hopkins
<div n="lb"/>({%Journal of the American Oriental Society,%}
<div n="lb"/>15, 260 {%et seq.%}) that Viśvāmitra was
<div n="lb"/>with the ten kings (Rv. vii. 18) when

<div n="lb"/>a markedly fictitious character; while

<div n="lb"/>and {@Yadus@} in one passage.<sup>1</sup> They also occur as enemies of

[Page2-012+ 48]
<div n="lb"/>hymn<sup>3</sup> Agni of the {@Bharatas@} is celebrated as victorious over the
<div n="lb"/>Pūrus, probably a reference to the same decisive overthrow.
<div n="lb"/>On the other hand, victories of the Pūrus over the aborigines
<div n="lb"/>seem to be referred to in several passages.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>The great kings of the Pūrus were {@Purukutsa@} and his son
<div n="lb"/>{@Trasadasyu,@} whose name bears testimony to his prowess
<div n="lb"/>against aboriginal foes, while a later prince was {@Tṛkṣi Trāsa-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@dasyava.@}
<div n="P"/>In the Rigveda the Pūrus are expressly<sup>5</sup> mentioned as on
<div n="lb"/>the {@Sarasvatī.@} Zimmer<sup>6</sup> thinks that the {@Sindhu@} (Indus) is
<div n="lb"/>meant in this passage. But Ludwig<sup>7</sup> and Hillebrandt<sup>8</sup> with
<div n="lb"/>much greater probability think that the eastern Sarasvatī in
<div n="lb"/>Kurukṣetra is meant. This view accords well with the sudden
<div n="lb"/>disappearance of the name of the Pūrus from Vedic tradition,
<div n="lb"/>a disappearance accounted for by Oldenberg's<sup>9</sup> conjecture that
<div n="lb"/>the Pūrus became part of the great Kuru people, just as
<div n="lb"/>{@Turvaśa@} and {@Krivi@} disappear from the tradition on their being
<div n="lb"/>merged in the {@Pañcāla@} nation. Trāsadasyava, the patronymic
<div n="lb"/>of {@Kuruśravaṇa@} in the Rigveda,<sup>10</sup> shows that the royal
<div n="lb"/>families of the Kurus and the Pūrus were allied by inter-
<div n="lb"/>marriage.
<div n="P"/>Hillebrandt,<sup>11</sup> admitting that the Pūrus in later times lived
<div n="lb"/>in the eastern country round the Sarasvatī, thinks that in
<div n="lb"/>earlier days they were to be found to the west of the Indus
<div n="lb"/>with {@Divodāsa.@} This theory must fall with the theory that
<div n="lb"/>Divodāsa was in the far west. It might, however, be held to
<div n="lb"/>be supported by the fact that Alexander found a <lang n="greek"></lang> — that
<div n="lb"/>is, a Paurava prince on the Hydaspes,<sup>12</sup> a sort of half-way
<div n="lb"/>locality between the Sarasvatī and the West. But it is quite
<div n="lb"/>simple to suppose either that the Hydaspes was the earlier
<div n="lb"/>home of the Pūrus, where some remained after the others had
[Page2-013+ 52]
<div n="lb"/>wandered east, or that the later Paurava represents a success-
<div n="lb"/>ful onslaught upon the west from the east.
<div n="P"/>In several other passages of the Rigveda<sup>13</sup> the Pūrus as a
<div n="lb"/>people seem to be meant. The Nirukta<sup>14</sup> recognizes the general
<div n="lb"/>sense of ‘man,’ but in no passage is this really necessary or
<div n="lb"/>even probable. So utterly, however, is the tradition lost that
<div n="lb"/>the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>15</sup> explains Pūru in the Rigveda<sup>16</sup> as
<div n="lb"/>an Asura Rakṣas; it is only in the Epic that Pūru revives as

<div n="lb"/>The term is, however, generally<sup>2</sup> applied to the team of the

<L>2144<pc>2-062<k1>bali<k2>bali
{@Bali@}¦ occurs several times in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and often later<sup>2</sup>
<div n="lb"/>in the sense of tribute to a king or offering to a god. Zimmer<sup>3</sup>
<div n="lb"/>thinks that the offerings were in both cases voluntary. He
<div n="lb"/>compares the notices of the Germans in Tacitus,<sup>4</sup> where the
<div n="lb"/>kings of the tribes are said to receive gifts in kind as presents,
<div n="lb"/>but not a regular tribute. There seems to be no ground what-
<div n="lb"/>ever for this view. No doubt in origin the prerogatives of
<div n="lb"/>monarchy were due to voluntary action on the part of the
<div n="lb"/>tribesmen,<sup>5</sup> but that the Vedic peoples, who were essentially
<div n="lb"/>a body of conquering invaders, were in this state is most
<div n="lb"/>improbable, and the attitude of the Vedic Indian to his gods
<div n="lb"/>was at least as compatible with tribute as with voluntary gifts.

[Page2-064+ 49]
<div n="lb"/>the restoration being carried out by {@Revottaras Pāṭava Cākra@}

<div n="lb"/>remarkable, Zimmer<sup>2</sup> indeed tacitly altering it to Prātīpīya.
<div n="lb"/>In the Epic and the Purāṇas<sup>3</sup> he is in the form of Vāhlīka
<div n="lb"/>made a brother of {@Devāpi@} and {@Śantanu,@} and a son of Pratīpa.
<div n="lb"/>To base chronological conclusions on this<sup>4</sup> would be utterly
<div n="lb"/>misleading, for the facts are that Devāpi was son of Ṛṣṭiṣeṇa
<div n="lb"/>and a priest, while Śantanu was a Kuru prince of unknown
<div n="lb"/>parentage, but not probably a son of Pratīpa, who seems to be
<div n="lb"/>a late figure in the Vedic age, later than {@Parikṣit,@} being his
<div n="lb"/>great-grandson in the Epic. Very possibly Balhika was a

<L>2204<pc>2-074<k1>brahmacarya<k2>brahmacarya
{@Brahma-carya@}¦ denotes the condition of life of the {@Brahma-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@cārin@}<sup>1</sup> or religious student. The technical sense is first found in
[Page2-075+ 70]
<div n="lb"/>the last Maṇḍala of the Rigveda.<sup>2</sup> The practice of studentship
<div n="lb"/>doubtless developed, and was more strictly regulated by custom
<div n="lb"/>as time went on, but it is regularly assumed and discussed in
<div n="lb"/>the later Vedic literature, being obviously a necessary part of
<div n="lb"/>Vedic society
<div n="P"/>The Atharvaveda<sup>3</sup> has in honour of the Brahmacārin a hymn
<div n="lb"/>which already gives all the characteristic features of religious
<div n="lb"/>studentship. The youth is initiated ({%upa-nī%}) by the teacher<sup>4</sup>
<div n="lb"/>into a new life; he wears an antelope skin, and lets his hair
<div n="lb"/>grow long;<sup>5</sup> he collects fuel,<sup>6</sup> and begs,<sup>7</sup> learns, and practises
<div n="lb"/>penance. All these characteristics appear in the later literature.
<div n="lb"/>The student lives in the house of his teacher ({%ācārya-kula-vāsin;%}<sup>8</sup>
<div n="lb"/>{%ante-vāsin%});<sup>9</sup> he begs,<sup>10</sup> looks after the sacrificial fires,<sup>11</sup> and
<div n="lb"/>tends the house.<sup>12</sup> His term of studentship might be long
<div n="lb"/>extended: it was normally fixed at twelve years,<sup>13</sup> but much
<div n="lb"/>longer periods, such as thirty-two years, are mentioned.<sup>14</sup> The
[Page2-076+ 56]
<div n="lb"/>age at which studentship began varied.<sup>15</sup> {@Śvetaketu@} com-
<div n="lb"/>menced at twelve and studied for twelve years.<sup>16</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is assumed in the Gṛhya Sūtras that the three Āryan castes
<div n="lb"/>were all required to pass through a period of studentship. But
<div n="lb"/>that this is much more than priestly schematism is uncertain.
<div n="lb"/>No doubt individuals of the {@Kṣatriya@} or {@Vaiśya@} caste might go
<div n="lb"/>through part of the period of studentship, just as Burmese boys
<div n="lb"/>of all classes now pass some time in a monastery as students.
<div n="lb"/>This is borne out by the reference in the Atharvaveda<sup>17</sup> to the
<div n="lb"/>king guarding his country by Brahmacarya — though that is
<div n="lb"/>susceptible of a different interpretation — and more clearly by
<div n="lb"/>the reference in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>18</sup> to a rite intended to
<div n="lb"/>benefit one who, although not a Brahmin, had studied ({%vidyām%}
<div n="lb"/>{%anūcya%}), but had not gained renown, and by references in the
<div n="lb"/>Upaniṣads to kings who like {@Janaka@} studied the Vedas and the
<div n="lb"/>Upaniṣads.<sup>19</sup> Normally, however, the Kṣatriya studied the art
<div n="lb"/>of war.<sup>20</sup>
<div n="P"/>One of the duties of the Brahmacārin was chastity. But
<div n="lb"/>reference is in several places<sup>21</sup> made to the possibility of mis-
<div n="lb"/>conduct between a student and the wife of his preceptor, nor is
<div n="lb"/>any very severe penance imposed in early times — later it is
<div n="lb"/>different — for such a sin. In certain cases the ritual required
<div n="lb"/>a breach of chastity, no doubt as a magic spell to secure
<div n="lb"/>fertility.<sup>22</sup>
<div n="P"/>Even an old man might on occasion become a pupil, as the
<div n="lb"/>story of {@Āruṇi@} shows.<sup>23</sup>

2. {@Brahman@}¦ is found in many passages of the Rigveda and
<div n="lb"/>later in the sense of ‘priest.’ In many passages of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup>
<div n="lb"/>he is referred to as praising the gods; in others<sup>2</sup> the sense of
<div n="lb"/>‘priest’ is adequate. In not a few cases<sup>3</sup> the priesthood as a
<div n="lb"/>profession is clearly alluded to, nor is there any reason to doubt<sup>4</sup>
<div n="lb"/>that in all cases the word has the technical sense of a member
<div n="lb"/>of the priesthood. There is, however, considerable doubt as to
<div n="lb"/>the number of cases in the Rigveda, where it has the technical
[Page2-078+ 60]
<div n="lb"/>sense of the priest who guides the sacrifice generally. It is
<div n="lb"/>undoubtedly found in that sense, both Muir<sup>5</sup> and Roth<sup>6</sup>
<div n="lb"/>recognizing instances of its being used thus. Geldner,<sup>7</sup> how-
<div n="lb"/>ever, is anxious to find that sense in a large number of passages,
<div n="lb"/>and insists that the {@Purohita@} was normally a Brahman in the
<div n="lb"/>narrower sense. Oldenberg,<sup>8</sup> on the other hand, holds with
<div n="lb"/>greater probability that in most of the passages adduced
<div n="lb"/>Brahman means simply ‘priest,’ and that the Purohita, who
<div n="lb"/>was essentially not a member of the ordinary body of sacri-
<div n="lb"/>ficing priests ({@Ṛtvij@}), was, when he officiated at the sacrifice,
<div n="lb"/>more usually the Hotṛ priest, and only later became the
<div n="lb"/>Brahman. This change he regards as having taken place when
<div n="lb"/>the importance of the hymns declined, and most weight was
<div n="lb"/>laid on the functions of the priest who superintended the sacrifice
<div n="lb"/>as a whole, and by his magic repaired the flaws in the sacrifice.<sup>9</sup>

1. {@Brāhmaṇa,@}¦ ‘descendant of a Brahman’ ({%i.e.,%} of a priest), is
<div n="lb"/>found only a few times in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> and mostly in its latest
[Page2-081+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>parts. In the Atharvaveda<sup>2</sup> and later<sup>3</sup> it is a very common
<div n="lb"/>word denoting ‘priest,’ and it appears in the quadruple division
<div n="lb"/>of the castes in the Puruṣa-sūkta (‘hymn of man’) of the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>It seems certain that in the Rigveda this Brāhmaṇa, or
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin, is already a separate caste, differing from the warrior
<div n="lb"/>and agricultural castes.<sup>5</sup> The texts regularly claim for them a
<div n="lb"/>superiority to the {@Kṣatriya@} caste,<sup>6</sup> and the Brahmin is able by
<div n="lb"/>his spells or manipulation of the rite to embroil the people and
<div n="lb"/>the warriors<sup>7</sup> or the different sections of the warriors.<sup>8</sup> If it
<div n="lb"/>is necessary to recognize, as is sometimes done, that the
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin does pay homage to the king at the {@Rājasūya,@}<sup>9</sup>
<div n="lb"/>nevertheless the unusual fact is carefully explained away so
<div n="lb"/>as to leave the priority of the Brahmin unaffected. But it
<div n="lb"/>is expressly recognized that the union of the Kṣatriya and
<div n="lb"/>the Brāhmaṇa is essential for complete prosperity.<sup>10</sup> It is
<div n="lb"/>admitted<sup>11</sup> that the king or the nobles might at times oppress
<div n="lb"/>the Brahmins, but it is indicated that ruin is then certain
<div n="lb"/>swiftly to follow.
[Page2-082+ 55]
<div n="P"/>The Brahmins are gods on earth,<sup>12</sup> like the gods in heaven,
<div n="lb"/>but this claim is hardly found in the Rigveda.<sup>13</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>14</sup> the Brahmin is said to be the
<div n="lb"/>‘recipient of gifts’ ({%ādāyī%}) and the ‘drinker of the offering’
<div n="lb"/>({%āpāyī%}). The other two epithets applied, {%āvasāyī%} and {%yathā-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%kāma-prayāpya,%} are more obscure; the former denotes either
<div n="lb"/>‘dwelling everywhere’<sup>15</sup> or ‘seeking food’;<sup>16</sup> the latter is usually
<div n="lb"/>taken as ‘moving at pleasure,’ but it must rather allude to the
<div n="lb"/>power of the king to assign a place of residence to the Brahmin.
<div n="P"/>In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>17</sup> the prerogatives of the Brah-
<div n="lb"/>min are summed up as (1) Arcā, ‘honour’; (2) Dāna, ‘gifts’;
<div n="lb"/>(3) Ajyeyatā, ‘freedom from oppression’; and (4) Avadhyatā,
<div n="lb"/>‘freedom from being killed.’ On the other hand, his duties
<div n="lb"/>are summed up as (5) Brāhmaṇya, ‘purity of descent’;
<div n="lb"/>(6) Pratirūpa-caryā, ‘devotion of the duties of his caste’; and
<div n="lb"/>(7) Loka-pakti, ‘the perfecting of people’ (by teaching).
<div n="P"/>1. {%Respect paid to Brahmins.%} — The texts are full<sup>18</sup> of references
<div n="lb"/>to the civilities to be paid to the Brahmin. He is styled
<div n="lb"/>{%bhagavant,%}<sup>19</sup> and is provided with good food<sup>20</sup> and entertain-
<div n="lb"/>ment wherever he goes. Indeed, his sanctity exempts him
<div n="lb"/>from any close inquiry into his real claim to Brahminhood
<div n="lb"/>according to the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.<sup>21</sup>
<div n="P"/>2. {%Gifts to Brahmins.%} — The Dānastuti (‘Praise of gifts’) is a
<div n="lb"/>recognized feature of the Rigveda, and the greed of the poets
<div n="lb"/>for {@Dakṣiṇās,@} or sacrificial fees, is notorious. Vedic texts<sup>22</sup>
<div n="lb"/>themselves recognize that the literature thence resulting ({@Nārā-@}
[Page2-083+ 56]
<div n="lb"/>{@śaṃsī@}) was often false to please the donors. It was, however,
<div n="lb"/>a rule<sup>23</sup> that Brahmins should not accept what had been
<div n="lb"/>refused by others; this indicates a keen sense of the danger of
<div n="lb"/>cheapening their wares. So exclusively theirs was the right to
<div n="lb"/>receive gifts that the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>24</sup> has to explain
<div n="lb"/>how {@Taranta@} and {@Purumīḷha@} became able to accept gifts by
<div n="lb"/>composing a Rigvedic hymn.<sup>25</sup> The exaggerations in the
<div n="lb"/>celebration of the gifts bestowed on the priests has the curious
<div n="lb"/>result of giving us a series of numerals of some interest ({@Daśan@}).
<div n="lb"/>In some passages<sup>26</sup> certain gifts — those of a horse or sheep — are
<div n="lb"/>forbidden, but this rule was not, it is clear, generally observed.
<div n="P"/>3. {%Immunities of Brahmins.%} — The Brahmin claimed to be
<div n="lb"/>exempt from the ordinary exercise of the royal power. When
<div n="lb"/>a king gives all his land and what is on it to the priests, the gift
<div n="lb"/>does not cover the property of the Brahmin according to the
<div n="lb"/>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>27</sup> The king censures all, but not the
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin,<sup>28</sup> nor can he safely oppress any Brahmin other than
<div n="lb"/>an ignorant priest.<sup>29</sup> An arbitrator (or a witness) must decide
<div n="lb"/>(or speak) for a Brahmin against a non-Brahmin in a legal
<div n="lb"/>dispute.<sup>30</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Brahmin's proper food is the {@Soma,@}<sup>31</sup> not {@Surā@}<sup>32</sup> or
<div n="lb"/>{@Parisrut,@}<sup>33</sup> and he is forbidden to eat certain forms of flesh.<sup>34</sup>
<div n="lb"/>On the other hand, he alone is allowed to eat the remains of
<div n="lb"/>the sacrifice,<sup>35</sup> for no one else is sufficiently holy to consume
<div n="lb"/>food which the gods have eaten. Moreover, though he cannot
<div n="lb"/>be a physician,<sup>36</sup> he helps the physician by being beside him
[Page2-084+ 56]
<div n="lb"/>while he exercises his art.<sup>37</sup> His wife<sup>38</sup> and his cow<sup>39</sup> are both
<div n="lb"/>sacred.
<div n="P"/>4. {%Legal Position of Brahmins.%} — The Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>40</sup>
<div n="lb"/>lays down a penalty of a hundred (the unit meant is unknown)
<div n="lb"/>for an insult to a Brahmin, and of a thousand for a blow; but
<div n="lb"/>if his blood is drawn, the penalty is a spiritual one. The only
<div n="lb"/>real murder is the slaying of a Brahmin according to the
<div n="lb"/>Satapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>41</sup> The crime of slaying a Brahmin ranks
<div n="lb"/>above the sin of killing any other man, but below that of killing
<div n="lb"/>an embryo ({%bhrūṇa%}) in the Yajurveda;<sup>42</sup> the crime of slaying an
<div n="lb"/>embryo whose sex is uncertain is on a level with that of slaying
<div n="lb"/>a Brahmin.<sup>43</sup> The murder of a Brahmin can be expiated only
<div n="lb"/>by the horse sacrifice,<sup>44</sup> or by a lesser rite in the late Taittirīya
<div n="lb"/>Āraṇyaka.<sup>45</sup> The ritual slaying of a Brahmin is allowed in the
<div n="lb"/>later ceremonial,<sup>46</sup> and hinted at in the curious legend of
<div n="lb"/>{@Śunaḥśepa;@}<sup>47</sup> and a Purohita might be punished with death for
<div n="lb"/>treachery to his master.<sup>48</sup>
<div n="P"/>5. {%Purity of Birth.%} — The importance of pure descent is seen
<div n="lb"/>in the stress laid on being a descendant of a Ṛṣi ({%ārṣeya%}).<sup>49</sup> But,
<div n="lb"/>on the other hand, there are clear traces of another doctrine,
<div n="lb"/>which requires learning, and not physical descent, as the true
<div n="lb"/>criterion of Ṛṣihood.<sup>50</sup> In agreement with this is the fact
<div n="lb"/>that {@Satyakāma Jābāla@} was received as a pupil, though his
<div n="lb"/>parentage was unknown, his mother being a slave girl who had
<div n="lb"/>been connected with several men,<sup>51</sup> and that in the Śatapatha
[Page2-085+ 59]
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa<sup>52</sup> the ceremony on acceptance as a pupil required
<div n="lb"/>merely the name of the pupil. So {@Kavaṣa@} is taunted in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda Brāhmaṇas<sup>53</sup> as being the son of a female slave ({@Dāsī@}),
<div n="lb"/>and {@Vatsa@} cleared himself of a similar imputation by a fire
<div n="lb"/>ordeal.<sup>54</sup> Moreover, a very simple rite was adequate to remove
<div n="lb"/>doubts as to origin.<sup>55</sup> In these circumstances it is doubtful
<div n="lb"/>whether much value attaches to the {@Pravara@} lists in which the
<div n="lb"/>ancestors of the priest were invoked at the beginning of the
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice by the Hotṛ and the Adhvaryu priests.<sup>56</sup> Still, in
<div n="lb"/>many parts of the ritual the knowledge of two or more genera-
<div n="lb"/>tions was needed,<sup>57</sup> and in one ceremony<sup>58</sup> ten ancestors who
<div n="lb"/>have drunk the Soma are required, but a literal performance of
<div n="lb"/>the rite is excused. Moreover, there are clear traces of ritual
<div n="lb"/>variations in schools, like those of the {@Vasiṣṭhas@} and the
<div n="lb"/>{@Viśvāmitras.@}
<div n="P"/>6. {%The Conduct of the Brahmin.%} — The Brahmin was required
<div n="lb"/>to maintain a fair standard of excellence.<sup>59</sup> He was to be kind
<div n="lb"/>to all<sup>60</sup> and gentle,<sup>61</sup> offering sacrifice and receiving gifts.<sup>62</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Especial stress was laid on purity of speech;<sup>63</sup> thus {@Viśvan-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@tara's@} excuse for excluding the {@Śyāparṇas@} from his retinue was
<div n="lb"/>their impure ({%apūtā%}) speech.<sup>64</sup> Theirs was the craving for
<div n="lb"/>knowledge<sup>65</sup> and the life of begging.<sup>66</sup> False Brahmins are
<div n="lb"/>those who do not fulfil their duties<sup>67</sup> ({%cf.%} {@Brahmabandhu@}) .
[Page2-086+ 58]
<div n="lb"/>But the penances for breach of duty are, in the Sūtras, of a
<div n="lb"/>very light and unimportant character.<sup>68</sup>
<div n="P"/>7. {%Brahminical Studies.%} — The aim of the priest is to obtain
<div n="lb"/>pre-eminence in sacred knowledge ({%brahma-varcasam%}), as is
<div n="lb"/>stated in numerous passages of Vedic literature.<sup>69</sup> Such
<div n="lb"/>distinction is not indeed confined to the Brahmin: the king
<div n="lb"/>has it also, but it is not really in a special manner appropriate
<div n="lb"/>to the Kṣatriya.<sup>70</sup> Many ritual acts are specified as leading to
<div n="lb"/>Brahmavarcasa,<sup>71</sup> but more stress is laid on the study of the
<div n="lb"/>sacred texts: the importance of such study is repeatedly
<div n="lb"/>insisted upon.<sup>72</sup>
<div n="P"/>The technical name for study is Svādhyāya: the Satapatha
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa is eloquent upon its advantages,<sup>73</sup> and it is asserted
<div n="lb"/>that the joy of the learned Śrotriya, or ‘student,’ is equal to
<div n="lb"/>the highest joy possible.<sup>74</sup> {@Nāka Maudgalya@} held that study
<div n="lb"/>and the teaching of others were the true penance ({%tapas%}).<sup>75</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>object was the ‘threefold knowledge’ ({%trayī vidyā%}), that of the
<div n="lb"/>Ṛc, Yajus, and Sāman,<sup>76</sup> a student of all three Vedas being
<div n="lb"/>called {%tri-śukriya%}<sup>77</sup> or {%tri-śukra,%}<sup>78</sup> ‘thrice pure.’ Other objects
<div n="lb"/>of study are enumerated in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>79</sup> in the
<div n="lb"/>Taittirīya Āraṇyaka,<sup>80</sup> the Chāndogya Upaniṣad,<sup>81</sup> etc. (See
<div n="lb"/>{@Itihāsa, Purāṇa; Gāthā, Nārāśaṃsī; Brahmodya; Anuśās-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@ana, Anuvyākhyāna, Anvākhyāna, Kalpa,@} 2. {@Brāhmaṇa;@}

<div n="lb"/>{@vidyā, Sarpavidyā; Atharvāṅgirasaḥ, Daiva, Nidhi, Pitrya,@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Rāśi; Sūtra,@} etc.)
[Page2-087+ 55]
<div n="P"/>Directions as to the exact place and time of study are given
<div n="lb"/>in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka<sup>82</sup> and in the Sūtras. If study is
<div n="lb"/>carried on in the village, it is to be done silently ({%manasā%}); if
<div n="lb"/>outside, aloud ({%vācā%}).
<div n="P"/>Learning is expected even from persons not normally com-
<div n="lb"/>petent as teachers, such as the {@Carakas,@} who are recognized in
<div n="lb"/>the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>83</sup> as possible sources of information.
<div n="lb"/>Here, too, may be mentioned the cases of Brahmins learning
<div n="lb"/>from princes, though their absolute value is doubtful, for the
<div n="lb"/>priests would naturally represent their patrons as interested in
<div n="lb"/>their sacred science: it is thus not necessary to see in these
<div n="lb"/>notices any real and independent study on the part of the
<div n="lb"/>Kṣatriyas.<sup>84</sup> {@Yājñavalkya@} learnt from {@Janaka,@}<sup>85</sup> {@Uddālaka@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Āruṇi@} and two other Brahmins from {@Pravāhaṇa Jaivali,@}<sup>86</sup>
<div n="lb"/>{@Dṛptabālāki Gārgya@} from {@Ajātaśatru,@}<sup>87</sup> and five Brahmins
<div n="lb"/>under the lead of Aruṇa from {@Aśvapati Kaikeya.@}<sup>88</sup> A few
<div n="lb"/>notices show the real educators of thought: wandering scholars
<div n="lb"/>went through the country<sup>89</sup> and engaged in disputes and
<div n="lb"/>discussions in which a prize was staked by the disputants.<sup>90</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Moreover, kings like Janaka offered rewards to the most learned
<div n="lb"/>of the Brahmins;<sup>91</sup> Ajātaśatru was jealous of his renown, and
<div n="lb"/>imitated his generosity. Again, learned women are several
<div n="lb"/>times mentioned in the Brāhmaṇas.<sup>92</sup>
<div n="P"/>A special form of disputation was the {@Brahmodya,@} for which
<div n="lb"/>there was a regular place at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’)<sup>93</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and at the Daśarātra (‘ten-day festival’).<sup>94</sup> The reward of
<div n="lb"/>learning was the gaining of the title of Kavi or Vipra, ‘sage.’<sup>95</sup>
[Page2-088+ 56]
<div n="P"/>8. {%The Functions of the Brahmin.%} — The Brahmin was required
<div n="lb"/>not merely to practise individual culture, but also to give
<div n="lb"/>others the advantage of his skill, either as a teacher or as a
<div n="lb"/>sacrificial priest, or as a Purohita.
<div n="P"/>As a teacher the Brahmin has, of course, the special duty of
<div n="lb"/>instructing his own son in both study and sacrificial ritual.<sup>96</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The texts give examples of this, such as Āruṇi and {@Śvetaketu,@}<sup>97</sup>
<div n="lb"/>or mythically Varuṇa and Bhṛgu.<sup>98</sup> This fact also appears
<div n="lb"/>from some of the names in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>99</sup> of the
<div n="lb"/>Sāmaveda and the Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Śāṅkhāyana
<div n="lb"/>Āraṇyaka.<sup>100</sup> On the other hand, these Vaṃśas and the
<div n="lb"/>Vaṃśas of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa show that a father often
<div n="lb"/>preferred to let his son study under a famous teacher. The
<div n="lb"/>relation of pupil and teacher is described under {@Brahmacarya.@}
<div n="lb"/>A teacher might take several pupils,<sup>101</sup> and he was bound to
<div n="lb"/>teach them with all his heart and soul.<sup>102</sup> He was bound to
<div n="lb"/>reveal everything to his pupil, at any rate to one who was
<div n="lb"/>staying with him for a year ({%saṃvatsara-vāsin%}),<sup>103</sup> an expression
<div n="lb"/>which shows, as was natural, that a pupil might easily
<div n="lb"/>change teachers. But, nevertheless, certain cases of learning
<div n="lb"/>kept secret and only revealed to special persons are enumer-
<div n="lb"/>ated.<sup>104</sup> The exact times and modes of teaching are elaborately
<div n="lb"/>laid down in the Sūtras,<sup>105</sup> but not in the earlier texts.
<div n="P"/>As priest the Brahmin operated in all the greater sacrifices;
<div n="lb"/>the simple domestic ({%gṛhya%}) rites could normally be performed
<div n="lb"/>without his help, but not the more important rites ({%śrauta%}).
[Page2-089+ 66]
<div n="lb"/>The number varied: the ritual literature requires sixteen priests
<div n="lb"/>to be employed at the greatest sacrifices (see {@Ṛtvij@}), but other
<div n="lb"/>rites could be accomplished with four,<sup>106</sup> five,<sup>107</sup> six,<sup>108</sup> seven,<sup>109</sup>
<div n="lb"/>or ten<sup>110</sup> priests. Again, the Kauṣītakins<sup>111</sup> had a seventeenth
<div n="lb"/>priest beside the usual sixteen, the Sadasya, so called because
<div n="lb"/>he watched the performance from the Sadas, ‘seat.’ In one
<div n="lb"/>rite, the Sattra (‘sacrificial session’) of the serpents, the
<div n="lb"/>Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>112</sup> adds three more to the sixteen, a
<div n="lb"/>second Unnetṛ, an Abhigara, and an Apagara. The later ritual
<div n="lb"/>places the Brahman at the head of all the priests, but this is
<div n="lb"/>probably not the early view (see {@Brahman@}).
<div n="P"/>The sacrifice ensured, if properly performed, primarily the
<div n="lb"/>advantages of the sacrificer ({%yajamāna%}),<sup>113</sup> but the priest shared
<div n="lb"/>in the profit, besides securing the {@Dakṣiṇās.@} Disputes between
<div n="lb"/>sacrificers and the priests were not rare, as in the case of
<div n="lb"/>{@Viśvantara@} and the {@Śyāparṇas,@}<sup>114</sup> or {@Janamejaya@} and the
<div n="lb"/>{@Asitamṛgas;@}<sup>115</sup> and the {@Aiṣāvīras@} are referred to as undesirable
<div n="lb"/>priests.<sup>116</sup> Moreover, {@Viśvāmitra@} once held the post of Puro-
<div n="lb"/>hita to {@Sudās,@} but gave place to {@Vasiṣṭha.@}
[Page2-090+ 53]
<div n="P"/>The position of {@Purohita@} differed considerably from that of
<div n="lb"/>the ordinary priest, for the Purohita not merely might officiate
<div n="lb"/>at the sacrifice, but was the officiator in all the private sacrifices
<div n="lb"/>of his king. Hence he could, and undoubtedly sometimes did,
<div n="lb"/>obtain great influence over his master in matters of secular
<div n="lb"/>importance; and the power of the priesthood in political as
<div n="lb"/>opposed to domestic and religious matters, no doubt rested on
<div n="lb"/>the Purohita.
<div n="P"/>There is no recognition in Vedic literature of the rule later
<div n="lb"/>prevailing by which, after spending part of his life as a Brahma-
<div n="lb"/>cārin, and part as a householder, the Brahmin became an
<div n="lb"/>ascetic<sup>117</sup> (later divided into the two stages of Vānaprastha,
<div n="lb"/>‘forest-dweller,’ and Saṃnyāsin, ‘mystic’). Yājñavalkya's
<div n="lb"/>case<sup>118</sup> shows that study of the Absolute might empty life of all
<div n="lb"/>its content for the sage, and drive him to abandon wife and
<div n="lb"/>family. In Buddhist times the same phenomenon is seen<sup>119</sup>
<div n="lb"/>applying to other than Brahmins. The Buddhist texts are
<div n="lb"/>here confirmed in some degree by the Greek authorities.<sup>120</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The practice bears a certain resemblance to the habit of kings,
<div n="lb"/>in the Epic tradition,<sup>121</sup> of retiring to the forest when active life
<div n="lb"/>is over.
<div n="P"/>From the Greek authorities<sup>122</sup> it also appears — what is
<div n="lb"/>certainly the case in the Buddhist literature<sup>123</sup> — that Brahmins
<div n="lb"/>practised the most diverse occupations. It is difficult to say
<div n="lb"/>how far this was true for the Vedic period. The analogy of the
<div n="lb"/>Druids<sup>124</sup> — in some respects very close — suggests that the
<div n="lb"/>Brahmins may have been mainly confined to their professional
<div n="lb"/>tasks, including all the learned professions such as astronomy<sup>125</sup>
[Page2-091+ 54]
<div n="lb"/>and so forth. This is not contradicted by any Vedic evidence,
<div n="lb"/>for instance, the poet of a hymn of the Rigveda<sup>126</sup> says he is a
<div n="lb"/>poet, his father a physician ({@Bhiṣaj@}), and his mother a grinder
<div n="lb"/>of corn ({@Upala-prakṣiṇī@}). This would seem to show that a
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin could be a doctor, while his wife would perform the
<div n="lb"/>ordinary household duties. So a Purohita could perhaps take
<div n="lb"/>the field to assist the king by prayer, as Viśvāmitra,<sup>127</sup> and
<div n="lb"/>later on Vasiṣṭha<sup>128</sup> do, but this does not show that priests
<div n="lb"/>normally fought. Nor do they seem normally to have been
<div n="lb"/>agriculturists or merchants. On the other hand, they kept
<div n="lb"/>cattle: a Brahmacārin's duty was to watch his master's
<div n="lb"/>cattle.<sup>129</sup> It is therefore needless to suppose that they could
<div n="lb"/>not, and did not, on occasion turn to agricultural or mercan-
<div n="lb"/>tile pursuits, as they certainly did later. But it must be
<div n="lb"/>remembered that in all probability there was more purity of
<div n="lb"/>blood, and less pressure of life, among the Brahmins of the
<div n="lb"/>Vedic age than later in Buddhist times, when the Vedic
<div n="lb"/>sacrificial apparatus was falling into grave disrepute.
<div n="P"/>It is clear that the Brahmins, whatever their defects, repre-
<div n="lb"/>sented the intellectual side of Vedic life, and that the Kṣatriyas,
<div n="lb"/>if they played a part in that life, did so only in a secondary
<div n="lb"/>degree, and to a minor extent. It is natural to suppose that
<div n="lb"/>the Brahmins also composed ballads, the precursors of the
<div n="lb"/>epic; for though none such have survived, a few stanzas of this
<div n="lb"/>character, celebrating the generosity of patrons, have been
<div n="lb"/>preserved by being embedded in priestly compositions. A
<div n="lb"/>legend in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>130</sup> shows clearly that the
<div n="lb"/>Brahmins regarded civilization as being spread by them only:
[Page2-092+ 48]
<div n="lb"/>{@Kosala@} and {@Videha,@} no doubt settled by Āryan tribes, are only
<div n="lb"/>rendered civilized and habitable by the influence of pious
<div n="lb"/>Brahmins. We need not doubt that the non-Brahminical
<div n="lb"/>tribes (see {@Vrātya@}) had attained intellectual as well as material
<div n="lb"/>civilization, but it is reasonable to assume that their civilization
<div n="lb"/>was inferior to that of the Brahmins, for the history of
<div n="lb"/>Hinduism is the conquest by the Brahmins — not by arms, but
<div n="lb"/>by mind — of the tribes Āryan and non-Āryan originally beyond
<div n="lb"/>the pale.

{@Bharata@}¦ is the name of a people of great importance in the

[Page2-095+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>with {@Sudās@} and the {@Tṛtsus,@}<sup>1</sup> while in the sixth Maṇḍala they
<div n="lb"/>are associated with {@Divodāsa.@}<sup>2</sup> In one passage<sup>3</sup> the Bharatas
<div n="lb"/>are, like the Tṛtsus, enemies of the {@Pūrus:@} there can be little
<div n="lb"/>doubt that Ludwig's view of the identity of the Bharatas and
<div n="lb"/>and Tṛtsus is practically correct. More precisely Oldenberg<sup>5</sup>
<div n="lb"/>considers that the Tṛtsus are the {@Vasiṣṭhas,@} the family singers
<div n="lb"/>of the Bharatas; while Geldner<sup>6</sup> recognizes, with perhaps more
<div n="lb"/>probability, in the Tṛtsus the royal family of the Bharatas.
<div n="lb"/>That the Tṛtsus and Bharatas were enemies, as Zimmer<sup>7</sup>
<div n="lb"/>holds, is most improbable even on geographical grounds, for the
<div n="lb"/>Tṛtsus in Zimmer's view<sup>8</sup> occupied the country to the east of
<div n="lb"/>the {@Paruṣṇī@} (Ravi), and the Bharatas must therefore be
<div n="lb"/>regarded as coming against the Tṛtsus from the west, whereas
<div n="lb"/>the Rigveda<sup>9</sup> recognizes two Bharata chiefs on the {@Sarasvatī,@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Āpayā,@} and {@Dṛṣadvatī@} — that is, in the holy land of India, the
<div n="lb"/>{@Madhyadeśa.@} Hillebrandt<sup>10</sup> sees in the connexion of the
<div n="lb"/>Tṛtsus and the Bharatas a fusion of two tribes; but this is not
<div n="lb"/>supported by any evidence beyond the fact that in his opinion
<div n="lb"/>some such theory is needed to explain Divodāsa's appearing in
<div n="lb"/>connexion with the {@Bharadvāja@} family, while Sudās, his son,
<div n="P"/>^4 Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 172
<div n="lb"/>{%et seq.%}
[Page2-096+ 65]
<div n="lb"/>or perhaps grandson ({%cf.%} {@Pijavana@}), is connected with the
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭhas and the {@Viśvāmitras.@}
<div n="P"/>In the later literature the Bharatas appear as especially
<div n="lb"/>famous. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>11</sup> mentions Bharata Dauḥ-
<div n="lb"/>ṣanti as a king, sacrificer of the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’)
<div n="lb"/>and {@Śatānīka Sātrājita,@} as another Bharata who offered that
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice. The Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>12</sup> mentions Bharata Dauḥ-
<div n="lb"/>ṣanti as receiving the kingly coronation from {@Dīrghatamas@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Māmateya,@} and Śatānīka as being consecrated by {@Somaśuṣman@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Vājaratnāyana,@} a priest whose name is of quite late origin.
<div n="lb"/>The geographical position of the Bharata people is clearly
<div n="lb"/>shown by the fact that the Bharata kings win victories over the
<div n="lb"/>{@Kāśis,@} and make offerings on the {@Yamunā@} (Jumna) and {@Gaṅgā@}
<div n="lb"/>(Ganges).<sup>13</sup> Moreover, in the formula of the king's proclama-
<div n="lb"/>tion for the people, the variants recorded<sup>14</sup> include {%Kuravaḥ,%}
<div n="lb"/>{%Pañcālāḥ, Kuru-Pañcālāḥ,%} and {%Bharatāḥ;%} and the Mahābhārata
<div n="lb"/>consistently recognizes the royal family of the {@Kurus@} as a
<div n="lb"/>Bharata family.<sup>15</sup> It is therefore extremely probable that
<div n="lb"/>Oldenberg<sup>16</sup> is right in holding that the Bharatas in the times
<div n="lb"/>of the Brāhmaṇas were merging in the Kuru-Pañcāla people.
<div n="P"/>The ritual practices of the Bharatas are repeatedly mentioned
<div n="lb"/>in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>17</sup> the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>18</sup> the
[Page2-097+ 67]
<div n="lb"/>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>19</sup> and the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka.<sup>20</sup> Already
<div n="lb"/>in the Rigveda<sup>21</sup> there is mention made of Agni Bhārata (‘of
<div n="lb"/>the Bharatas’). In the Āprī hymns<sup>22</sup> occurs a goddess
<div n="lb"/>Bhāratī, the personified divine protective power of the
<div n="lb"/>Bharatas: her association in the hymns with Sarasvatī reflects
<div n="lb"/>the connexion of the Bharatas with the Sarasvatī in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda.<sup>9</sup> Again, in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>23</sup> Agni is
<div n="lb"/>referred to as {%brāhmaṇa Bhārata,%} ‘priest of the Bharatas,’ and
<div n="lb"/>is invited to dispose of the offering {%Manuṣvat Bharatavat,%} ‘like
<div n="lb"/>Manu,’ ‘like Bharata.’<sup>24</sup>
<div n="P"/>In one or two passages<sup>25</sup> Sudās or Divodāsa and, on the
<div n="lb"/>other hand, Purukutsa or Trasadasyu appear in a friendly
<div n="lb"/>relation. Possibly this points, as Oldenberg<sup>26</sup> suggests, to the
<div n="lb"/>union of Bharatas and Pūrus with the Kurus.

{@Bharad-vāja@}¦ is the name of the reputed<sup>1</sup> author of the sixth
<div n="lb"/>Maṇḍala of the Rigveda. The attribution is so far correct that
<div n="lb"/>Bharadvāja<sup>2</sup> and the Bharadvājas<sup>3</sup> are repeatedly mentioned as
<div n="lb"/>singers in that Maṇḍala. Judging by the tone of the references
<div n="lb"/>to Bharadvāja, he can hardly be deemed to have been a con-
<div n="lb"/>temporary of any of the hymns.<sup>4</sup> According to the Pañcaviṃśa
[Page2-098+ 52]
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa,<sup>5</sup> he was the Purohita of {@Divodāsa.@} This interpreta-
<div n="lb"/>tion is to be preferred to that of Roth,<sup>6</sup> who suggests that he
<div n="lb"/>and Divodāsa were identical. His connexion with the house of
<div n="lb"/>Divodāsa also appears from the statement of the Kāṭhaka
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitā<sup>7</sup> that Bharadvāja gave {@Pratardana@} the kingdom. It
<div n="lb"/>is unnecessary to suppose that the same Bharadvāja was meant
<div n="lb"/>in both cases, and that Pratardana was a son of Divodāsa: the
<div n="lb"/>later Saṃhitās refer to Bharadvāja, like the other great sages,
<div n="lb"/>irrespective of chronology.
<div n="P"/>The Bharadvājas in their poems mention {@Bṛbu, Bṛsaya,@} and
<div n="lb"/>the {@Pārāvatas.@}<sup>8</sup> Hillebrandt<sup>9</sup> has pointed out that they are also
<div n="lb"/>connected with the {@Sṛñjayas.@} In particular, the Śāṅkhāyana
<div n="lb"/>Śrauta Sūtra<sup>10</sup> mentions that Bharadvāja gained largesse from
<div n="lb"/>{@Prastoka Sārñjaya@} and Bṛbu. But it is very doubtful if it is
<div n="lb"/>correct to place all these people and Divodāsa in Arachosia
<div n="lb"/>and Drangiana.

{@Bhiṣaj,@}¦ ‘physician,’ is a word of common occurrence in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later.<sup>2</sup> There is no trace whatever in the former
<div n="lb"/>text of the profession being held in disrepute: the Aśvins,<sup>3</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇa,<sup>4</sup> and Rudra<sup>5</sup> are all called physicians. On the other
<div n="lb"/>hand, in the Dharma literature<sup>6</sup> this profession is utterly
[Page2-105+ 54]
<div n="lb"/>despised. This dislike is found as early as the Yajurveda
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitās,<sup>7</sup> where the Aśvins are condemned because of their
<div n="lb"/>having to do with the practice of medicine ({%bheṣaja%}), on the
<div n="lb"/>ground that it brings them too much among men, an allusion
<div n="lb"/>to the caste dislike of promiscuous contact.
<div n="P"/>The Rigveda<sup>8</sup> contains a hymn in which a physician cele-
<div n="lb"/>brates his plants and their healing powers. Moreover, wonder-
<div n="lb"/>ful cures are referred to as performed by the Aśvins: the
<div n="lb"/>healing of the lame<sup>9</sup> and of the blind;<sup>10</sup> the rejuvenation of the
<div n="lb"/>aged {@Cyavana@}<sup>11</sup> and of {@Puraṃdhi's@} husband;<sup>12</sup> the giving of an
<div n="lb"/>iron leg ({%jaṅghā āyasī%}) to {@Viśpalā,@}<sup>13</sup> a deed only more wonderful
<div n="lb"/>if we assume that Viśpalā was a mare, as has been suggested by
<div n="lb"/>Pischel.<sup>14</sup> It would in all probability be a mistake to assume<sup>15</sup>
<div n="lb"/>that the Vedic Indians had any surgical skill: they no doubt
<div n="lb"/>applied simples to wounds,<sup>16</sup> but both their medicine and their
<div n="lb"/>surgery must have been most primitive. All that the Atharva-
<div n="lb"/>veda shows in regard to medicine is the use of herbs combined
<div n="lb"/>with spells,<sup>17</sup> and of water ({%cf.%} {@Jalāṣa@}), remedies Indo-European
<div n="lb"/>in character, but not of much scientific value. On the other
<div n="lb"/>hand, the knowledge of anatomy shown (see {@Śarīra@}), though
<div n="lb"/>betraying grave inaccuracies, is not altogether insignificant;
<div n="lb"/>but that was due no doubt mainly to the practice of dissecting
<div n="lb"/>animals at the sacrifice.
<div n="P"/>There is some evidence in the Rigveda<sup>18</sup> that the practice of
<div n="lb"/>medicine was already a profession; this is supported by the
<div n="lb"/>inclusion of a physician in the list of victims at the Puruṣa-
<div n="lb"/>medha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda.<sup>19</sup> According to
[Page2-106+ 48]
<div n="lb"/>Bloomfield,<sup>20</sup> a hymn of the Atharvaveda<sup>21</sup> contains a physician's
<div n="lb"/>deprecation of the use of home-made remedies instead of
<div n="lb"/>reliance on his professional training.

{@Bhṛgu@}¦ is a sage of almost entirely mythical character in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda and later. He counts as a son of Varuṇa,<sup>1</sup> bearing
<div n="lb"/>the patronymic Vāruṇi.<sup>2</sup> In the plural the Bhṛgus are
<div n="lb"/>repeatedly<sup>3</sup> alluded to as devoted to the fire cult. They are
<div n="lb"/>clearly<sup>4</sup> no more than a group of ancient priests and ancestors
<div n="lb"/>with an eponymous Bhṛgu<sup>5</sup> in the Rigveda, except in three
<div n="lb"/>passages,<sup>6</sup> where they are evidently regarded as an historic
<div n="lb"/>family. It is not clear, however, whether they were priests or
<div n="lb"/>warriors: in the battle of the ten kings the Bhṛgus appear with
<div n="lb"/>the {@Druhyus,@} perhaps as their priests, but this is not certain.<sup>7</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the later literature the Bhṛgus are a real family, with sub-
<div n="lb"/>divisions like the {@Aitaśāyana,@} according to the Kauṣītaki
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa.<sup>8</sup> The Bhṛgus are mentioned as priests in connexion
<div n="lb"/>with various rites, such as the Agnisthāpana<sup>9</sup> and the Daśa-
<div n="lb"/>peyakratu.<sup>10</sup> In many passages they are conjoined with the
<div n="lb"/>{@Aṅgirases.@}<sup>11</sup> the close association of the two families is shown
[Page2-110+ 43]
<div n="lb"/>by the fact that Cyavana is called either a Bhārgava or an
<div n="lb"/>Āṅgirasa in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>12</sup> In the Atharvaveda<sup>13</sup>
<div n="lb"/>the name of Bhṛgu is selected to exemplify the dangers incurred
<div n="lb"/>by the oppressors of Brahmans: the {@Sṛñjaya Vaitahavyas@}
<div n="lb"/>perish in consequence of an attack on Bhṛgu. In the Aitareya

<F>7) In viii. 3, 9; 6, 18; 102, 4, the

<div n="lb"/>where, being named with brother and sister, it must be an
<div n="lb"/>expression of relationship. The sense appears to be ‘(father's)
<div n="lb"/>brother's son,’ ‘cousin,’<sup>2</sup> this meaning alone accounting for the
<div n="lb"/>sense of ‘rival,’ ‘enemy,’ found elsewhere in the Atharvaveda,<sup>3</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and repeatedly in the other Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas.<sup>4</sup> In

<div n="lb"/>develop into rivalry and enmity. The original meaning may,
<div n="lb"/>however, have been ‘nephew,’<sup>5</sup> as the simple etymological
<div n="lb"/>sense would be ‘brother's son’; but this seems not to account
<div n="lb"/>for the later meaning so well. The Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>6</sup> pre-
<div n="lb"/>scribes the telling of a falsehood to a Bhrātṛvya, who, further,
<div n="lb"/>is often given the epithets ‘hating’ ({%dviṣan%}) and ‘evil’ ({%apriya,%}
<div n="lb"/>{%pāpman%}) in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas.<sup>7</sup> The Athar-

{@Magadha@}¦ is the name of a people who appear throughout
<div n="lb"/>Vedic literature as of little repute. Though the name is not
<div n="lb"/>actually found in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> it occurs in the Atharvaveda,<sup>2</sup>
<div n="lb"/>where fever is wished away to the {@Gandhāṛis@} and {@Mūjavants,@}
<div n="lb"/>northern peoples, and to the {@Aṅgas@} and Magadhas, peoples of
<div n="lb"/>the east. Again, in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha
<div n="lb"/>(‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda,<sup>3</sup> the Māgadha, or man of
<div n="lb"/>Magadha, is included as dedicated to {%ati-kruṣṭa,%} ‘loud noise’(?),
<div n="lb"/>while in the {@Vrātya@} hymn of the Atharvaveda<sup>4</sup> the Māgadha is
<div n="lb"/>said to be connected with the Vrātya as his Mitra, his Mantra,
<div n="lb"/>his laughter, and his thunder in the four quarters. In the
<div n="lb"/>Śrauta Sūtras<sup>5</sup> the equipment characteristic of the Vrātya is
<div n="lb"/>said to be given, when the latter is admitted into the Āryan
<div n="lb"/>Brahminical community, to a bad Brahmin living in Magadha
<div n="lb"/>({%brahma-bandhu Māgadha-deśīya%}), but this point does not occur
<div n="lb"/>in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.<sup>6</sup> On the other hand, respectable
<div n="lb"/>Brahmins sometimes lived there, for the Kauṣītaki Āraṇyaka<sup>7</sup>
<div n="lb"/>mentions {@Madhyama, Prātībodhī-putra,@} as {%Magadha-vāsin,%}
<div n="lb"/>‘living in Magadha.’ Oldenberg,<sup>8</sup> however, seems clearly right
<div n="lb"/>in regarding this as unusual.
[Page2-117+ 58]
<div n="P"/>The Magadhas are evidently a people in the Baudhāyana and
<div n="lb"/>other Sūtras,<sup>9</sup> possibly also in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka.<sup>10</sup> It is
<div n="lb"/>therefore most improbable that Zimmer<sup>11</sup> can be right in
<div n="lb"/>thinking that in the Yajurveda<sup>3</sup> and the Atharvaveda<sup>4</sup> the
<div n="lb"/>Māgadha is not a man of Magadha, but a member of the mixed
<div n="lb"/>caste produced by a {@Vaiśya@} marrying a {@Kṣatriya@} woman.<sup>12</sup>
<div n="lb"/>But the theory of mixed castes, in any case open to some
<div n="lb"/>doubt, cannot be accepted when used to explain such obviously
<div n="lb"/>tribal names as Māgadha. The fact that the Māgadha is
<div n="lb"/>often in later times a minstrel is easily accounted for by the
<div n="lb"/>assumption that the country was the home of minstrelsy and
<div n="lb"/>that wandering bards from Magadha were apt to visit the more
<div n="lb"/>western lands. This class the later texts recognize as a caste,
<div n="lb"/>inventing an origin by intermarriage of the old-established
<div n="lb"/>castes.
<div n="P"/>The dislike of the Magadhas, which may be Rigvedic, since
<div n="lb"/>the {@Kīkaṭas@} were perhaps the prototype of the Magadhas, was
<div n="lb"/>in all probability due, as Oldenberg<sup>13</sup> thinks, to the fact that
<div n="lb"/>the Magadhas were not really Brahminized. This is entirely in
<div n="lb"/>accord with the evidence of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>14</sup> that
<div n="lb"/>neither {@Kosala@} nor {@Videha@} were fully Brahminized at an early
<div n="lb"/>date, much less Magadha. Weber<sup>15</sup> suggests two other grounds
<div n="lb"/>that may have influenced the position — the persistence of
<div n="lb"/>aboriginal blood and the growth of Buddhism. The latter
<div n="lb"/>consideration is hardly applicable to the Yajurveda or the
<div n="lb"/>Atharvaveda; but the imperfect Brahminization of the land, if
<div n="lb"/>substituted for it in accordance with Oldenberg's suggestion,
[Page2-118+ 51]
<div n="lb"/>would have some force. The former motive, despite Olden-
<div n="lb"/>berg's doubt, seems fully justified. Pargiter<sup>16</sup> has gone so
<div n="lb"/>far as to suggest that in Magadha the Āryans met and mingled
<div n="lb"/>with a body of invaders from the east by sea. Though there
<div n="lb"/>is no evidence for this view in the Vedic texts, it is reason-
<div n="lb"/>able to suppose that the farther east the Āryans penetrated,
<div n="lb"/>the less did they impress themselves upon the aborigines.
<div n="lb"/>Modern ethnology confirms this {%a priori%} supposition in so far as
<div n="lb"/>it shows Āryan types growing less and less marked as the
<div n="lb"/>eastern part of India is reached, although such evidence is not
<div n="lb"/>decisive in view of the great intermixture of peoples in India.

<div n="lb"/>{@Śūrasenakas,@} and Brahmāvarta<sup>3</sup> as meaning the particularly
<div n="lb"/>holy land between the Sarasvatī and the {@Dṛṣadvatī.@} The
<div n="lb"/>Baudhāyana Dharma Sūtra<sup>4</sup> defines Āryāvarta as the land east
<div n="lb"/>of Vinaśana; west of the Kālaka-vana, ‘Black Forest,’ or rather
<div n="lb"/>Kanakhala, near Hardvār; south of the Himālaya; and north
<div n="lb"/>of the Pāriyātra or the Pāripātra Mountains; adding that, in
<div n="lb"/>the opinion of others,<sup>5</sup> it was confined to the country between
<div n="lb"/>the Yamunā and the Gaṅgā, while the {@Bhāllavins@}<sup>6</sup> took it as
<div n="lb"/>the country between the boundary-river (or perhaps the Saras-
[Page2-126+ 84]

<div n="lb"/>Dharma Śāstra,<sup>8</sup> in accord with the Vasiṣṭha Dharma Sūtra,<sup>9</sup>
<div n="lb"/>defines Āryāvarta as the region between the Vindhya and the

{@Māṃsa,@}¦ ‘flesh.’ The eating of flesh appears as something
<div n="lb"/>quite regular in the Vedic texts, which show no trace of the
<div n="lb"/>doctrine of Ahiṃsā, or abstaining from injury to animals. For
<div n="lb"/>example, the ritual offerings of flesh contemplate that the gods
<div n="lb"/>will eat it, and again the Brahmins ate the offerings.<sup>1</sup> Again,
<div n="lb"/>the slaying of a ‘great ox’ ({%mahokṣa%}) or a ‘great goat’ ({%mahāja%})
<div n="lb"/>for a guest was regularly prescribed;<sup>2</sup> and the name {@Atithigva@}
<div n="lb"/>probably means ‘slaying cows for guests.’<sup>3</sup> The great sage
<div n="lb"/>{@Yājñavalkya@} was wont to eat the meat of milch cows and
<div n="lb"/>bullocks ({%dhenv-anaḍuha%}) if only it was {%aṃsala%} (‘firm’ or
<div n="lb"/>‘tender’).<sup>4</sup> The slaughter of a hundred bulls ({%ukṣan%}) was
<div n="lb"/>credited to one sacrificer, {@Agastya.@}<sup>5</sup> The marriage ceremony
<div n="lb"/>was accompanied by the slaying of oxen, clearly for food.<sup>6</sup>
[Page2-146+ 62]
<div n="P"/>That there was any general objection to the eating of flesh
<div n="lb"/>is most improbable. Sometimes it is forbidden, as when a
<div n="lb"/>man is performing a vow,<sup>7</sup> or its use is disapproved, as in
<div n="lb"/>a passage of the Atharvaveda,<sup>8</sup> where meat is classed with
<div n="lb"/>{@Surā,@} or intoxicating liquor, as a bad thing. Again, in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda<sup>9</sup> the slaying of the cows is said to take place in the
<div n="lb"/>{@Aghās,@} a deliberate variation for {@Maghās;@} but this may be
<div n="lb"/>the outcome merely of a natural association of death with
<div n="lb"/>gloom, even when cows alone are the victims in question.
<div n="lb"/>The Brāhmaṇas also contain the doctrine of the eater in this
<div n="lb"/>world being eaten in the next,<sup>10</sup> but this is not to be regarded
<div n="lb"/>as a moral or religious disapproval of eating flesh, though it
<div n="lb"/>no doubt contains the germ of such a view, which is also in
<div n="lb"/>harmony with the persuasion of the unity of existence, which
<div n="lb"/>becomes marked in the Brāhmaṇas. But Ahiṃsā as a deve-
<div n="lb"/>loped and articulate doctrine would seem to have arisen from
<div n="lb"/>the acceptance of the doctrine of transmigration, which in its
<div n="lb"/>fundamentals is later than the Brāhmaṇa period.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="P"/>On the other hand, it is to be noted that the cow was on the
<div n="lb"/>road to acquire special sanctity in the Rigveda,<sup>12</sup> as is shown
<div n="lb"/>by the name {%aghnyā,%}<sup>13</sup> ‘not to be slain,’ applied to it in several
<div n="lb"/>passages. But this fact cannot be regarded as showing that
[Page2-147+ 50]
<div n="lb"/>meat eating generally was condemned. Apart from mythical
<div n="lb"/>considerations, such as the identification of the cow with earth
<div n="lb"/>or Aditi (which are, of course, much more than an effort of
<div n="lb"/>priestly ingenuity), the value of the cow for other purposes
<div n="lb"/>than eating was so great as to account adequately for its
<div n="lb"/>sanctity, the beginnings of which can in fact be traced back to
<div n="lb"/>Indo-Iranian times.<sup>14</sup> Moreover, the ritual of the cremation
<div n="lb"/>of the dead required the slaughter of a cow as an essential
<div n="lb"/>part, the flesh being used to envelope the dead body.<sup>15</sup>
<div n="P"/>The usual food of the Vedic Indian, as far as flesh was
<div n="lb"/>concerned, can be gathered from the list of sacrificial victims:
<div n="lb"/>what man ate he presented to the gods — that is, the sheep, the
<div n="lb"/>goat, and the ox. The horse sacrifice was an infrequent
<div n="lb"/>exception: it is probably not to be regarded as a trace of the
<div n="lb"/>use of horseflesh as food, though the possibility of such being
<div n="lb"/>the case cannot be overlooked in view of the widespread use
<div n="lb"/>of horseflesh as food in different countries and times. It is,
<div n="lb"/>however, more likely that the aim of this sacrifice was to
<div n="lb"/>impart magic strength, the speed and vigour of the horse, to
<div n="lb"/>the god and his worshippers, as Oldenberg<sup>16</sup> argues.

{@Māsa@}¦ denotes a ‘month,’ a period of time repeatedly men-
<div n="lb"/>tioned in the Rigveda and later.
<div n="P"/>The characteristic days (or rather nights) of the month were
<div n="lb"/>those of the new moon, Amā-vasyā, ‘home-staying (night),’ and
<div n="lb"/>‘of the full moon,’ Paurṇa-māsī. Two hymns of the Atharva-
<div n="lb"/>veda<sup>1</sup> celebrate these days respectively. A personification of
<div n="lb"/>the phases of the moon is seen in the four names Sinīvālī,<sup>2</sup>
[Page2-157+ 72]
<div n="lb"/>the day before new moon; Kuhū,<sup>3</sup> also called Guṅgū,<sup>4</sup> the
<div n="lb"/>new moon day; Anumati,<sup>5</sup> the day before full moon; and
<div n="lb"/>Rākā,<sup>6</sup> the day of new moon. The importance of the new and
<div n="lb"/>full moon days is seen in the Darśa-pūrṇamāsau, or festivals
<div n="lb"/>of the new and full moon days respectively.
<div n="P"/>One special day in the month, the {@Ekāṣṭakā,@} or eighth day
<div n="lb"/>after full moon, was important. In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>7</sup>
<div n="lb"/>there are stated to be in the year twelve such, mentioned
<div n="lb"/>between the twelve days of full moon and the twelve days of
<div n="lb"/>new moon. But one Ekāṣṭakā is referred to in the Yajurveda
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitās and elsewhere<sup>8</sup> as of quite special importance. This
<div n="lb"/>was, in the accordant opinion of most commentators, the
<div n="lb"/>eighth day after the full moon of {@Māgha.@} It marked the end
<div n="lb"/>of the year, or the beginning of the new year. Though the
<div n="lb"/>Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa<sup>9</sup> places the winter solstice in the new
<div n="lb"/>moon of Māgha, the latter date probably means the new moon
<div n="lb"/>preceding full moon in Māgha,<sup>10</sup> not the new moon following
[Page2-158+ 74]
<div n="lb"/>full moon; but it is perhaps possible to account adequately for
<div n="lb"/>the importance of the Ekāṣṭakā as being the first Aṣṭakā
<div n="lb"/>after the beginning of the new year.
<div n="P"/>It is not certain exactly how the month was reckoned, whether
<div n="lb"/>from the day after new moon to new moon — the system known
<div n="lb"/>as {%amānta,%} or from the day after full moon to full moon — the {%pūr-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%ṇimānta%} system, which later, at any rate, was followed in North
<div n="lb"/>India, while the other system prevailed in the south. Jacobi<sup>11</sup>
<div n="lb"/>argues that the year began in the full moon of Phālguna, and
<div n="lb"/>that only by the full moon's conjunction with the Nakṣatra could
<div n="lb"/>the month be known. Oldenberg<sup>12</sup> points to the fact that the
<div n="lb"/>new moon is far more distinctively an epoch than the full
<div n="lb"/>moon; that the Greek, Roman, and Jewish years began with
<div n="lb"/>the new moon; and that the Vedic evidence is the division of
<div n="lb"/>the month into the former ({%pūrva%}) and latter ({%apara%}) halves,
<div n="lb"/>the first being the bright ({%śukla%}), the second the dark ({%kṛṣṇa%})
<div n="lb"/>period. Thibaut<sup>13</sup> considers that to assume the existence of
<div n="lb"/>the {%pūrṇimānta%} system for the Veda is unnecessary, though
<div n="lb"/>possible. Weber<sup>10</sup> assumes that it occurs in the Kauṣītaki
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa as held by the scholiasts. But it would probably
<div n="lb"/>be a mistake to press that passage, or to assume that the
<div n="lb"/>{%amānta%} system was rigidly accepted in the Veda: it seems at
<div n="lb"/>least as probable that the month was vaguely regarded as
<div n="lb"/>beginning with the new moon day, so that new moon preceded
<div n="lb"/>full moon, which was in the middle, not the end or the
<div n="lb"/>beginning of the month.
<div n="P"/>That a month regularly had 30 days is established by the
<div n="lb"/>conclusive evidence of numerous passages in which the year is
<div n="lb"/>given 12 months and 360 days. This month is known from the
<div n="lb"/>earliest records, being both referred to directly and alluded to.<sup>14</sup>
[Page2-159+ 55]
<div n="lb"/>It is the regular month of the Brāhmaṇas,<sup>15</sup> and must be
<div n="lb"/>regarded as the month which the Vedic Indian recognized.
<div n="lb"/>No other month is mentioned as such in the Brāhmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>literature; it is only in the Sūtras that months of different
<div n="lb"/>length occur. The Sāmaveda Sūtras<sup>16</sup> refer to (1) years with
<div n="lb"/>324 days — {%i.e.,%} periodic years with 12 months of 27 days each;
<div n="lb"/>(2) years with 351 days — {%i.e.,%} periodic years with 12 months of
<div n="lb"/>27 days each, plus another month of 27 days; (3) years with
<div n="lb"/>354 days — {%i.e.,%} 6 months of 30 days, and 6 with 29 days, in
<div n="lb"/>other words, lunar synodic years; (4) years with 360 days, or
<div n="lb"/>ordinary civil ({%sāvana%}) years; (5) years with 378 days, which,
<div n="lb"/>as Thibaut<sup>17</sup> clearly shows, are third years, in which, after
<div n="lb"/>two years of 360 days each, 18 days were added to bring about
<div n="lb"/>correspondence between the civil year and the solar year of
<div n="lb"/>366 days. But even the Sāmasūtras do not mention the year
<div n="lb"/>of 366 days, which is first known to the Jyotiṣa<sup>18</sup> and to
<div n="lb"/>Garga.<sup>19</sup>
<div n="P"/>That the Vedic period was acquainted with the year of
<div n="lb"/>354 days cannot be affirmed with certainty. Zimmer,<sup>20</sup> indeed,
<div n="lb"/>thinks that it is proved by the fact that pregnancy is estimated
<div n="lb"/>at ten months, or sometimes a year.<sup>21</sup> But Weber<sup>22</sup> may be
<div n="lb"/>right in holding that the month is the periodic month of
<div n="lb"/>27 days, for the period is otherwise too long if a year is taken.
<div n="lb"/>On the other hand, the period of ten months quite well suits
<div n="lb"/>the period of gestation, if birth takes place in the tenth month,
<div n="lb"/>so that in this sense the month of 30 days may well be meant.
[Page2-160+ 57]
<div n="P"/>The year of 12 months of 30 days each being admittedly
<div n="lb"/>quite unscientific, Zimmer<sup>23</sup> is strongly of opinion that it was
<div n="lb"/>only used with a recognition of the fact that intercalation took
<div n="lb"/>place, and that the year formed part of a greater complex,
<div n="lb"/>normally the five your Yuga or cycle. This system is well
<div n="lb"/>known from the Jyotṣa: it consists of 62 months of 29(16/31) days
<div n="lb"/>each = 1, 830 days (two of these months being intercalary, one
<div n="lb"/>in the middle and one at the end), or 61 months of 30 days,
<div n="lb"/>or 60 months of 30(1/2) days, the unit being clearly a solar year
<div n="lb"/>of 366 days. It is not an ideal system, since the year is too
<div n="lb"/>long;<sup>24</sup> but it is one which cannot be claimed even for the
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa period, during which no decision as to the true
<div n="lb"/>length of the year seems to have been arrived at. The
<div n="lb"/>references to it seen by Zimmer in the Rigveda<sup>25</sup> are not even
<div n="lb"/>reasonably plausible, while the {%pañcaka yuga,%} cited by him from
<div n="lb"/>the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>26</sup> occurs only in a quotation in
<div n="lb"/>a commentary, and had no authority for the text itself.
<div n="P"/>On the other hand, there was undoubtedly some attempt to
<div n="lb"/>bring the year of 360 days — a synodic lunar year — roughly
<div n="lb"/>into connexion with reality. A Sāmasūtra<sup>27</sup> treats it as a
<div n="lb"/>solar year, stating that he sun perambulates each Naxatra in
<div n="lb"/>13(1/3) days, while others again evidently interpolated 18 days
<div n="lb"/>every third year, in order to arrive at some equality. But
<div n="lb"/>Vedic literature, from the Rigveda<sup>28</sup> downwards,<sup>29</sup> teems with
<div n="lb"/>the assertion of the difficulty of ascertaining the month.
<div n="lb"/>The length is variously given as 30 days,<sup>30</sup> 35 days,<sup>31</sup> or
[Page2-161+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>36 days.<sup>32</sup> The last number possibly indicates an intercalation
<div n="lb"/>after six years (6×6 = 36, or for ritual purposes 35), but for
<div n="lb"/>this we have no special evidence. There are many references<sup>33</sup>
<div n="lb"/>to the year having 12 or 13 months.
<div n="P"/>The names of the months are, curiously enough, not at all
<div n="lb"/>ancient. The sacrificial texts of the Yajurveda give them in
<div n="lb"/>their clearest form where the Agnicayana, ‘building of the
<div n="lb"/>fire-altar,’ is described.<sup>34</sup> These names are the following:
<div n="lb"/>(1) Madhu, (2) Mādhava (spring months, {%vāsantikāv ṛtū%});
<div n="lb"/>(3) Śukra, (4) Śuci (summer months, {%graiṣmāv ṛtū%}); (5) Nabha
<div n="lb"/>(or Nabhas),<sup>35</sup> (6) Nabhasya (rainy months, {%vārṣikāv ṛtū%});
<div n="lb"/>(7) Iṣa, (8) Ūrja (autumn months, {%śāradāv ṛtū%}); (9) Saha (or
<div n="lb"/>Sahas),<sup>35</sup> (10) Sahasya (winter months, {%haimantikāv ṛtū%});
<div n="lb"/>(11) Tapa (or Tapas),<sup>35</sup> (12) Tapasya (cool months, {%śaiśirāv%}
<div n="lb"/>{%ṛtū%}).
<div n="P"/>There are similar lists in the descriptions of the Soma
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice<sup>36</sup> and of the horse sacrifice,<sup>37</sup> all of them agreeing in
<div n="lb"/>essentials. There are other lists of still more fanciful names,<sup>38</sup>
<div n="lb"/>but these have no claim at all to represent actual divisions in
<div n="lb"/>popular use. It is doubtful if the list given above is more than
<div n="lb"/>a matter of priestly invention. Weber points out that Madhu
<div n="lb"/>and Mādhava later appear as names of spring, and that these
<div n="lb"/>two are mentioned in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka<sup>39</sup> as if actually
[Page2-162+ 59]
<div n="lb"/>employed; but the evidence is very inadequate to show that
<div n="lb"/>the other names of the months given in the list were in ordinary
<div n="lb"/>use.<sup>40</sup>
<div n="P"/>In some of these lists the intercalary month is mentioned.
<div n="lb"/>The name given to it in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>41</sup> is Aṃhasas-
<div n="lb"/>pati, while that given in the Taittirīya<sup>42</sup> and Maitrāyaṇī
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitās<sup>43</sup> is Saṃsarpa. The Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>44</sup> gives it the
<div n="lb"/>name of Malimluca, which also occurs elsewhere, along with
<div n="lb"/>Saṃsarpa, in one of the lists of fanciful names.<sup>45</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>Atharvaveda<sup>46</sup> describes it as {%sanisrasa,%} ‘slipping,’ owing no
<div n="lb"/>doubt to its unstable condition.
<div n="P"/>The other method of naming the months is from the
<div n="lb"/>{@Nakṣatras.@} It is only beginning to be used in the Brāhmaṇas,
<div n="lb"/>but is found regularly in the Epic and later. The Jyotiṣa<sup>47</sup>
<div n="lb"/>mentions that Māgha and Tapa were identical: this is the fair
<div n="lb"/>interpretation of the passage, which also involves the identifica-
<div n="lb"/>tion of Madhu with Caitra, a result corresponding with the
<div n="lb"/>view frequently found in the Brāhmaṇas, that the full moon in
<div n="lb"/>Citrā, and not that in Phalgunī, is the beginning of the year.<sup>48</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>49</sup> are found two curious ex-
<div n="lb"/>pressions, {%yava%} and {%ayava,%} for the light and dark halves of the
<div n="lb"/>month, which is clearly considered to begin with the light half.
<div n="lb"/>Possibly the words are derived, as Eggling<sup>50</sup> thinks, from {%yu,%}
<div n="lb"/>‘ward off,’ with reference to evil spirits. The word {@Parvan@}
[Page2-163+ 54]
<div n="lb"/>(‘joint’ = division of time) probably<sup>51</sup> denotes a half of the
<div n="lb"/>month, perhaps already in the Rigveda.<sup>52</sup> More precisely the
<div n="lb"/>first half, the time of the waxing light, is called {%pūrva-pakṣa,%}<sup>53</sup>
<div n="lb"/>the second, that of the waning light, {%apara-pakṣa,%}<sup>54</sup> Either of
<div n="lb"/>these might be called a half-month ({%ardha-māsa%}).<sup>55</sup>

{@Mudgala@}¦ and {@Mudgalanī,@} ‘Mudgala's wife,’ both figure in
<div n="lb"/>a hopelessly obscure hymn of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> variously inter-
<div n="lb"/>preted by Pischel<sup>2</sup> and Geldner<sup>3</sup> and von Bradke<sup>4</sup> as telling
<div n="lb"/>of a real chariot race in which, despite difficulties, Mudgala
<div n="lb"/>won by his wife's aid. The Indian tradition is as variant as
<div n="lb"/>the interpretations of modern authorities. Ṣaḍguruśiṣya<sup>5</sup>
<div n="lb"/>explains that Mudgala's oxen were stolen, that he pursued the
<div n="lb"/>thieves with the one old ox he had left, and that hurling his
<div n="lb"/>hammer ({%dru-ghaṇa%}) he caught the marauders. Yāska,<sup>6</sup> on the
<div n="lb"/>other hand, says that Mudgala won a race with a {%drughaṇa%}
<div n="lb"/>and an ox instead of with two oxen. It is pretty clear that,
<div n="lb"/>as Roth<sup>7</sup> observed, the tradition is merely a guess, and a bad
<div n="lb"/>one, at the meaning of an obscure hymn, and this view is
[Page2-167+ 55]
<div n="lb"/>accepted by Oldenberg.<sup>8</sup> Bloomfield<sup>9</sup> has interpreted the
<div n="lb"/>legend as one of heavenly, not of human, events. Mudgala,
<div n="lb"/>probably a variant form of Mudgara,<sup>10</sup> which in the later
<div n="lb"/>language means a hammer or a similar weapon, may be meant
<div n="lb"/>as a personification of the thunderbolt of Indra, rather than

<L>2496<pc>2-167<k1>muni<k2>muni
{@Muni@}¦ occurs in one hymn of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> where it seems to
<div n="lb"/>denote an ascetic of magic powers with divine afflatus ({%deveṣita%}),
<div n="lb"/>the precursor of the strange ascetics of later India. This
<div n="lb"/>agrees with the fact that {@Aitaśa,@} the Muni, is in the Aitareya
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> regarded by his son as deranged, a view not
<div n="lb"/>unjustified if the nonsense which passes as the Aitaśapralāpa.<sup>3</sup>
<div n="lb"/>‘Chatter of Aitaśa,’ was really his. The Rigveda<sup>4</sup> calls Indra
<div n="lb"/>the ‘friend of Munis,’ and the Atharvaveda<sup>5</sup> refers to a ‘divine
<div n="lb"/>Muni’ ({%deva muni%}), by whom a similar ascetic may be meant.
<div n="P"/>In the Upaniṣads<sup>6</sup> the Muni is of a more restrained type:
<div n="lb"/>he is one who learns the nature of the Brahman, the Absolute,
<div n="lb"/>by study, or sacrifice, or penance, or fasting, or faith ({%śraddhā%}).
<div n="lb"/>It must not of course be thought that there is any absolute
<div n="lb"/>distinction between the older Muni and the later: in both
<div n="lb"/>cases the man is in a peculiar ecstatic condition, but the ideal
<div n="lb"/>of the Upaniṣads is less material than the earlier picture of the
<div n="lb"/>Muni, who is more of a ‘medicine man’ than a sage. Nor
<div n="lb"/>would it be wise to conclude from the comparative rareness
[Page2-168+ 39]
<div n="lb"/>of the mention of the Muni in the Vedic texts that he was
<div n="lb"/>an infrequent figure in Vedic times: he was probably not
<div n="lb"/>approved by the priests who followed the ritual, and whose

<div n="lb"/>is a proof of the newness of the elephant to the Vedic Indians.<sup>3</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Later the adjective Hastin alone became the regular name of
<div n="lb"/>the animal (like {@Mahiṣa@} of the ‘buffalo’). The elephant is
<div n="lb"/>also denoted in the Rigveda by the descriptive term Mṛga
<div n="lb"/>Vāraṇa,<sup>4</sup> the ‘wild or dangerous animal,’ the adjective {%vāraṇa%}
<div n="lb"/>similarly becoming one of the names for ‘elephant’ in the later
<div n="lb"/>language. Pischel's view<sup>5</sup> that the catching of elephants by
<div n="lb"/>the use of tame female elephants is already alluded to in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda<sup>6</sup> seems very doubtful. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>7</sup>

{@Mṛgayu,@}¦ ‘hunter,’ occurs in the later Saṃhitās<sup>1</sup> and the
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇas,<sup>2</sup> but not very often. The Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>3</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>4</sup> however, in the list of victims
<div n="lb"/>at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) include a number of
<div n="lb"/>names which seem to be those of persons who make a liveli-
<div n="lb"/>hood by fishing or by hunting, such as the {@Mārgāra,@} ‘hunter,’
[Page2-173+ 47]
<div n="lb"/>the {@Kaivarta@} or {@Kevarta, Pauñjiṣṭha, Daśa, Maināla,@} ‘fisher
<div n="lb"/>man,’ and perhaps the {@Bainda@} and the Ānda,<sup>5</sup> who seem to
<div n="lb"/>have been some sort of fishermen.
<div n="P"/>It is not probable that even in the earliest Vedic period
<div n="lb"/>hunting formed the main source of livelihood for any of the
<div n="lb"/>Vedic tribes: pastoral pursuits and agriculture ({@Kṛṣi@}) were, no
<div n="lb"/>doubt, the mainstay of their existence. But it would be
<div n="lb"/>unreasonable to suppose that not much hunting was done,
<div n="lb"/>both for recreation and for purposes of food, as well as for
<div n="lb"/>protection of flocks from wild beasts. The Rigveda is naturally
<div n="lb"/>our chief source of information in regard to hunting. The
<div n="lb"/>arrow was sometimes employed,<sup>6</sup> but, as is usual with primitive
<div n="lb"/>man, the normal instruments of capture were nets and pitfalls.
<div n="lb"/>Birds were regularly caught in nets ({@Pāśa,@}<sup>7</sup> {@Nidhā,@}<sup>8</sup> {@Jāla@}),<sup>9</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>bird-catcher being called {%nidhā-pati,%}<sup>10</sup> ‘master of snares.’ The
<div n="lb"/>net was fastened on pegs<sup>11</sup> (as is done with modern nets for
<div n="lb"/>catching birds). Another name of net is apparently {@Mukṣījā.@}
<div n="P"/>Pits were used for catching antelopes ({@Ṛśya@}), and so were
<div n="lb"/>called {%ṛśya-da,%}<sup>12</sup> ‘antelope-catching.’ Elephants were captured
<div n="lb"/>as in Greek times, perhaps through the instrumentality of tame
<div n="lb"/>females (see {@Mṛga Hastin@}). Apparently the boar was captured
<div n="lb"/>in the chase, dogs being used,<sup>13</sup> but the passage from which
<div n="lb"/>this view is deduced is of uncertain mythological content.
<div n="lb"/>There is also an obscure reference<sup>14</sup> to the capture of the
<div n="lb"/>buffalo ({@Gaura@}), but it is not clear whether the reference is to
<div n="lb"/>shooting with an arrow or capturing by means of ropes,
<div n="lb"/>perhaps a lasso, or a net. The lion was captured in pitfalls,<sup>15</sup>
<div n="lb"/>or was surrounded by the hunters and slain;<sup>16</sup> one very obscure
<div n="lb"/>passage refers to the lion being caught by ambuscade, which
<div n="lb"/>perhaps merely alludes to the use of the hidden pit.<sup>17</sup>
<div n="P"/>The modes of catching fish are little known, for the only
<div n="lb"/>evidence available are the explanations of the various names
[Page2-174+ 45]
<div n="lb"/>mentioned in the Yajurveda. Sāyaṇa<sup>18</sup> says that {@Dhaivara@} is
<div n="lb"/>one who takes fish by netting a tank on either side; Dāśa and
<div n="lb"/>{@Śauṣkala@} do so by means of a fish-hook ({%baḍiśa%}); Bainda,
<div n="lb"/>Kaivarta, and Maināla by means of a net ({%jāla%}); Mārgāra
<div n="lb"/>catches fish in the water with his hands; Ānda by putting in
<div n="lb"/>pegs at a ford (apparently by building a sort of dam); {@Parṇaka@}
<div n="lb"/>by putting a poisoned leaf on the water. But none of these
<div n="lb"/>explanations can claim much authority.

{@Mṛtyu,@}¦ ‘death,’ is repeatedly mentioned in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and later<sup>2</sup> as a thing of terror. There are a hundred and one
<div n="lb"/>forms of death, the natural one by old age<sup>3</sup> ({%jarā%}), and a
<div n="lb"/>hundred others, all to be avoided.<sup>4</sup> To die before old age
<div n="lb"/>({%purā jarasaḥ%})<sup>5</sup> is to die before the allotted span ({%purā āyuṣaḥ%}),<sup>6</sup>
<div n="lb"/>the normal length of life being throughout Vedic literature
<div n="lb"/>spoken of as a hundred years.<sup>7</sup> On the other hand, the evils
<div n="lb"/>of old age in the loss of physical strength were clearly realized.<sup>8</sup>
<div n="lb"/>one of the feats of the Aśvins was to restore old {@Cyavāna@} to
<div n="lb"/>his former youth and powers, and another was the rejuvenation
<div n="lb"/>of {@Kali.@}<sup>9</sup> The Atharvaveda<sup>10</sup> is full of charms of all sorts to
<div n="lb"/>avert death and secure length of years ({%āyuṣya%}).
<div n="P"/>The modes of disposing of the dead were burial and cremation
<div n="lb"/>(see {@Agnidagdha@}). Both existed in the early Vedic period,<sup>11</sup>
<div n="lb"/>as in Greece;<sup>12</sup> but the former method was on the whole less
<div n="lb"/>favoured, and tended to be regarded with disapproval. The
<div n="lb"/>bones of the dead, whether burned or not, were marked by the
<div n="lb"/>erection of a tumulus ({@Śmaśāna@}): the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>13</sup>
<div n="lb"/>preserves traces of strong differences of opinion as to the mode
<div n="lb"/>in which these tumuli should be constructed. There is little
<div n="lb"/>or no trace<sup>14</sup> of the custom common in northern lands of
<div n="lb"/>sending the dead man to sea in a burning ship: the reference
[Page2-176+ 60]
<div n="lb"/>to a ship<sup>15</sup> seems to point to mythical perils after death, not to
<div n="lb"/>the mode of burial.
<div n="P"/>The life after death was to the Vedic Indian a repetition of
<div n="lb"/>the life in this world. He passed into the next world {%sarva-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%tanuḥ sāṅgaḥ,%} ‘with whole body and all his members,’<sup>16</sup> enjoying
<div n="lb"/>there the same pleasures as he had enjoyed on earth. Even
<div n="lb"/>in the Rigveda<sup>17</sup> there are hints of evil awaiting evil-doers, but
<div n="lb"/>it is not until the Atharvaveda<sup>18</sup> and the Brāhmaṇas<sup>19</sup> that
<div n="lb"/>a hell of punishment is set out, and it is in the Brāhmaṇas<sup>20</sup>
<div n="lb"/>that good and evil deeds are said to produce happiness or hell
<div n="lb"/>hereafter. But there is no hint of extinction<sup>21</sup> in the Rigveda
<div n="lb"/>as the fate of the wicked, as Roth<sup>22</sup> inclined to think. The
<div n="lb"/>Vedic poet not being deeply moral, his verses do not convey,
<div n="lb"/>as would those of a man convinced of sin, warnings of future
<div n="lb"/>judgment.

<div n="lb"/>the Purohita), the Rājanya, the Mahiṣī (the first wife of the

<div n="lb"/>of food’; and the Akṣāvāpa, ‘superintender of dicing’ or
<div n="lb"/>‘thrower of dice.’ In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup> the order is
<div n="lb"/>Senānī; Purohita; Mahisī; Sūta; Grāmaṇī; Kṣattṛ; Saṃ-
<div n="lb"/>grahitṛ; Bhāgadugha; Akṣāvāpa; Go-nikartana, ‘slayer of

{@Ratha@}¦ in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later<sup>2</sup> denotes ‘chariot’ as
<div n="lb"/>opposed to {@Anas,@} ‘cart,’ though the distinction is not absolute.
<div n="lb"/>Of differences in the structure of the two we have no informa-
<div n="lb"/>tion, except that the {@Kha,@} or nave hole, in the wheel of the
<div n="lb"/>chariot was greater than in that of the cart.<sup>3</sup>
<div n="P"/>The chariot has, as a rule, two wheels ({@Cakra@}), to which
<div n="lb"/>reference is frequently made.<sup>4</sup> The wheel consisted of a rim
<div n="lb"/>({@Pavi@}), a felly ({@Pradhi@}), spokes ({@Ara@}),<sup>5</sup> and a nave ({@Nabhya@}).
<div n="lb"/>The rim and the felly together constitute the {@Nemi.@} The hole
<div n="lb"/>in the nave is called {@Kha:@} into it the end of the axle was
<div n="lb"/>inserted; but there is some uncertainty whether {@Āṇi@} denotes
<div n="lb"/>the extremity of the axle that was inserted in the nave, or the
<div n="lb"/>lynch-pin used to keep that extremity in the wheel. Sometimes
<div n="lb"/>a solid wheel was used.<sup>6</sup>
<div n="P"/>The axle ({@Akṣa@}) was, in some cases, made of {@Araṭu@} wood;<sup>7</sup>
<div n="lb"/>round its ends the wheels revolved. To the axle was attached
<div n="lb"/>the body of the chariot ({@Kośa@}). This part is also denoted by
<div n="lb"/>the word {@Vandhura,@} which more precisely means the ‘seat’
<div n="lb"/>of the chariot. The epithet {%tri-vandhura%} is used of the chariot
<div n="lb"/>of the Aśvins, seemingly to correspond with another of its
<div n="lb"/>epithets, {%tri-cakra:%} perhaps, as Weber<sup>8</sup> thinks, a chariot with
<div n="lb"/>three seats and three wheels was a real form of vehicle; but
<div n="lb"/>Zimmer<sup>9</sup> considers that the vehicle was purely mythical. {@Garta@}
<div n="lb"/>also denotes the seat of the warrior.
[Page2-202+ 61]
<div n="P"/>At right angles to the axle was the pole of the chariot ({@Īṣā,@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Praüga@}). Normally there was, it seems, one pole, on either
<div n="lb"/>side of which the horses were harnessed, a yoke ({@Yuga@}) being
<div n="lb"/>laid across their necks; the pole was passed through the hole
<div n="lb"/>in the yoke (called Kha<sup>10</sup> or Tardman),<sup>11</sup> the yoke and the pole
<div n="lb"/>then being tied together.<sup>12</sup>
<div n="P"/>The horses were tied by the neck ({%grīvā%}), where the yoke was
<div n="lb"/>placed, and also at the shoulder, presumably by traces fastened
<div n="lb"/>to a bar of wood at right angles to the pole, or fastened to the
<div n="lb"/>ends of the pole, if that is to be regarded, as it probably
<div n="lb"/>should, as of triangular shape, wide at the foot and coming to
<div n="lb"/>a point at the tip.<sup>13</sup> The traces seem to be denoted by {@Raśmi@}
<div n="lb"/>and {@Raśanā.@} These words also denote the ‘reins,’ which were
<div n="lb"/>fastened to the bit (perhaps {%śiprā%}) in the horse's mouth. The
<div n="lb"/>driver controlled the horses by reins, and urged them on with
<div n="lb"/>a whip ({%Kaśā%}).<sup>14</sup> The girths of the horse were called Kakṣyā.<sup>15</sup>
<div n="P"/>The normal number of horses seems to have been two, but
<div n="lb"/>three or four<sup>16</sup> were often used. It is uncertain whether, in
<div n="lb"/>these cases, the extra horse was attached in front or at the
<div n="lb"/>side; possibly both modes were in use. Even five steeds could
<div n="lb"/>be employed.<sup>17</sup> Horses were normally used for chariots, but
<div n="lb"/>the ass ({%gardabha%})<sup>18</sup> or mule ({%aśvatarī%})<sup>19</sup> are also mentioned.
<div n="lb"/>The ox was employed for drawing carts, and in fact derived its
[Page2-203+ 57]
<div n="lb"/>name, {@Anaḍvāh,@} from this use. Sometimes a poor man had to
<div n="lb"/>be content with a single steed, which then ran between two
<div n="lb"/>shafts.<sup>20</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the chariot the driver stood on the right, while the
<div n="lb"/>warrior was on the left, as indicated by his name, {@Savyeṣṭha@} or
<div n="lb"/>{@Savyaṣṭhā,@}<sup>21</sup> He could also sit when he wanted, for the
<div n="lb"/>chariot had seats, and an archer would naturally prefer to sit
<div n="lb"/>while shooting his arrows.
<div n="P"/>The dimensions of the chariot are given in the Śulba Sūtra<sup>22</sup>
<div n="lb"/>of Āpastamba at 188 Aṅgulis (finger-breadths) for the pole,
<div n="lb"/>104 for the axle, and 86 for the yoke. The material used in
<div n="lb"/>its construction was wood, except for the rim of the wheel.<sup>23</sup>
<div n="P"/>Many other parts of the chariot are mentioned, their names
<div n="lb"/>being often obscure in meaning: see {@Aṅka, Nyaṅka, Uddhi,@}

{@Ratha-kāra,@}¦ ‘chariot-maker,’ is mentioned in the Atharva-
<div n="lb"/>veda<sup>1</sup> as one of those who are to be subject to the king, seeming
<div n="lb"/>to stand generally as an example of the industrial population.
<div n="lb"/>He is also referred to in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās<sup>2</sup> and in the
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇas:<sup>3</sup> in all these passages, as well a probably in the
<div n="lb"/>Atharvaveda also, the Rathakāra already forms a caste. The

<div n="lb"/>but it is unreasonable to suppose that such an origin is

<div n="lb"/>to have been a functional caste. Hillebrandt<sup>5</sup> suggests that

<div n="lb"/>family is ranked after, not before, a Brāhmaṇa Kula, a ‘Brah-
<div n="lb"/>min family.’

1. {@Rājan,@}¦ ‘king,’ is a term repeatedly occurring in the Rig-
<div n="lb"/>veda<sup>1</sup> and the later literature.<sup>2</sup> It is quite clear that the
<div n="lb"/>normal, though not universal form of government, in early
<div n="lb"/>India was that by kings, as might be expected in view of the
<div n="lb"/>fact that the Āryan Indians were invaders in a hostile territory:
<div n="lb"/>a situation which, as in the case of the Āryan invaders of
<div n="lb"/>Greece and of the German invaders of England, resulted almost
<div n="lb"/>necessarily in strengthening the monarchic element of the
<div n="lb"/>constitution.<sup>3</sup> The mere patriarchal organization of society
<div n="lb"/>is not sufficient, as Zimmer<sup>4</sup> assumes, to explain the Vedic
<div n="lb"/>kingship.
[Page2-211+ 53]
<div n="P"/>{%Tenure of Monarchy.%} — Zimmer<sup>5</sup> is of opinion that while the
<div n="lb"/>Vedic monarchy was sometimes hereditary, as is indeed shown
<div n="lb"/>by several cases where the descent can be traced,<sup>6</sup> yet in others
<div n="lb"/>the monarchy was elective, though it is not clear whether the
<div n="lb"/>selection by the people was between the members of the royal
<div n="lb"/>family only or extended to members of all the noble clans. It
<div n="lb"/>must, however, be admitted that the evidence for the elective
<div n="lb"/>monarchy is not strong. As Geldner<sup>7</sup> argues, all the passages
<div n="lb"/>cited<sup>8</sup> can be regarded not as choice by the cantons ({@Viś@}), but
<div n="lb"/>as acceptance by the subjects ({%viś%}): this seems the more prob-
<div n="lb"/>able sense. Of course this is no proof that the monarchy was
<div n="lb"/>not sometimes elective: the practice of selecting one member
<div n="lb"/>of the family to the exclusion of another less well qualified is
<div n="lb"/>exemplified by the legend in Yāska<sup>9</sup> of the Kuru brothers,
<div n="lb"/>{@Devāpi@} and {@Śantanu,@} the value of which, as evidence of
<div n="lb"/>contemporary views, is not seriously affected by the legend
<div n="lb"/>itself being of dubious character and validity.
<div n="P"/>Royal power was clearly insecure: there are several references
<div n="lb"/>to kings being expelled from their realms, and their efforts to
<div n="lb"/>recover their sovereignty,<sup>10</sup> and the Atharvaveda contains spells
<div n="lb"/>in the interest of royalty.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%The King in War.%} — Naturally the Vedic texts, after the Rig-
<div n="lb"/>veda, contain few notices of the warlike adventures that no
<div n="lb"/>doubt formed a very considerable proportion of the royal
<div n="lb"/>functions. But the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>12</sup> contains the state-
<div n="lb"/>ment that the {@Kuru-Pañcāla@} kings, who, like the Brahmins of
[Page2-212+ 71]
<div n="lb"/>those tribes, stand as representatives of good form, used to
<div n="lb"/>make their raids in the dewy season. The word {@Udāja,@} too,
<div n="lb"/>with its variant Nirāja, records that kings took a share of the
<div n="lb"/>booty of war. The Rigveda<sup>13</sup> has many references to Vedic
<div n="lb"/>wars: it is clear that the Kṣatriyas were at least as intent on
<div n="lb"/>fulfilling their duty of war as the Brahmins on sacrificing and
<div n="lb"/>their other functions. Moreover, beside offensive war, defence
<div n="lb"/>was a chief duty of the king: he is emphatically the ‘protector
<div n="lb"/>of the tribe’ ({%gopā janasya%}), or, as is said in the {@Rājasūya@}
<div n="lb"/>(‘royal consecration’), ‘protector of the Brahmin.’<sup>14</sup> His
<div n="lb"/>{@Purohita@} was expected to use his spells and charms to secure
<div n="lb"/>the success of his king's arms. The king no doubt fought in
<div n="lb"/>person: so {@Pratardana@} met death in war according to the
<div n="lb"/>Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad;<sup>15</sup> and in the Rājasūya the king is invoked
<div n="lb"/>as ‘sacker of cities’ ({%purāṃ bhettā%}).
<div n="P"/>{%The King in Peace.%} — In return for his warlike services the
<div n="lb"/>king received the obedience<sup>16</sup> — sometimes forced<sup>17</sup> — of the
<div n="lb"/>people, and in particular their contributions for the mainten-
<div n="lb"/>ance of royalty. The king is regularly<sup>18</sup> regarded as ‘devouring
[Page2-213+ 50]
<div n="lb"/>the people,’ but this phrase must not be explained as meaning that
<div n="lb"/>he necessarily oppressed them. It obviously has its origin in a
<div n="lb"/>custom by which the king and his retinue were fed by the
<div n="lb"/>people's contributions, a plan with many parallels. It is also
<div n="lb"/>probable that the king could assign the royal right of mainten-
<div n="lb"/>ance to a Kṣatriya, thus developing a nobility supported by the
<div n="lb"/>people. Taxation would not normally fall on Kṣatriya or
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin; the texts contain emphatic assertions of the exemp-
<div n="lb"/>tion of the goods of the latter from the royal bounty.<sup>19</sup>In
<div n="lb"/>the people, however, lay the strength of the king.<sup>20</sup> See also
<div n="lb"/>{@Bali.@}
<div n="P"/>In return the king performed the duties of judge. Himself
<div n="lb"/>immune from punishment ({%a-daṇḍya%}), he wields the rod of
<div n="lb"/>punishment ({@Daṇḍa@}).<sup>21</sup> It is probable that criminal justice
<div n="lb"/>remained largely in his actual administration, for the Sūtras<sup>22</sup>
<div n="lb"/>preserve clear traces of the personal exercise of royal criminal
<div n="lb"/>jurisdiction. Possibly the jurisdiction could be exercised by a
<div n="lb"/>royal officer, or even by a delegate, for a Rājanya is mentioned
<div n="lb"/>as an overseer ({%adhyakṣa%}) of the punishment of a Śūdra in the
<div n="lb"/>Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā.<sup>23</sup> In civil justice it may be that the king
<div n="lb"/>played a much less prominent part, save as a court of final
<div n="lb"/>appeal, but evidence is lacking on this head. The {@Madhyamaśī@}
<div n="lb"/>of the Rigveda was probably not a royal, but a private
<div n="lb"/>judge or arbitrator. A wide criminal jurisdiction is, how-
<div n="lb"/>ever, to some extent supported<sup>24</sup> by the frequent mention of
<div n="lb"/>Varuṇa's spies, for Varuṇa is the divine counterpart of the
<div n="lb"/>human king.<sup>25</sup> Possibly such spies could be used in war
<div n="lb"/>also.<sup>26</sup>
<div n="P"/>There is no reference in early Vedic literature to the exercise
<div n="lb"/>of legislative activity by the king, though later it is an essential
[Page2-214+ 52]
<div n="lb"/>part of his duties.<sup>27</sup> Nor can we say exactly what executive
<div n="lb"/>functions devolved on the king.
<div n="P"/>In all his acts the king was regularly advised by his {@Puro-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@hita;@} he also had the advantage of the advice of the royal
<div n="lb"/>ministers and attendants (see {@Ratnin@}). The local administra-
<div n="lb"/>tion was entrusted to the {@Grāmaṇī,@} or village chief, who may
<div n="lb"/>have been selected or appointed by the king. The outward signs
<div n="lb"/>of the king's rank were his palace<sup>28</sup> and his brilliant dress.<sup>29</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%The King as Landowner.%} — The position of the king with
<div n="lb"/>regard to the land is somewhat obscure. The Greek notices,<sup>30</sup>
<div n="lb"/>in which, unhappily, it would be dangerous to put much trust,
<div n="lb"/>since they were collected by observers who were probably little
<div n="lb"/>used to accurate investigations of such matters, and whose
<div n="lb"/>statements were based on inadequate information, vary in their
<div n="lb"/>statements. In part they speak of rent being paid, and declare
<div n="lb"/>that only the king and no private person could own land, while
<div n="lb"/>in part they refer to the taxation of land. Hopkins<sup>31</sup> is strongly
<div n="lb"/>of opinion that the payments made were paid for protection
<div n="lb"/>-{%i.e.,%} in modern terminology as a tax, but that the king was
<div n="lb"/>recognized as the owner of all the land, while yet the individual
<div n="lb"/>or the joint family also owned the land. As against Baden-
<div n="lb"/>Powell,<sup>32</sup> who asserted that the idea of the king as a landowner
<div n="lb"/>was later, he urges for the Vedic period that the king, as we
<div n="lb"/>have seen, is described as devouring the people, and that,
<div n="lb"/>according to the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>33</sup> the {@Vaiśya@} can be
<div n="lb"/>devoured at will and maltreated (but, unlike the {@Śūdra,@} not
<div n="lb"/>killed); and for the period of the legal Sūtras and Śāstras he
<div n="lb"/>cites Bṛhaspati and Nārada as clearly recognizing the king's
<div n="lb"/>overlordship, besides a passage of the Mānava Dharma Śāstra<sup>34</sup>
<div n="lb"/>which describes the king as ‘lord of all,’ a phrase which
[Page2-215+ 59]
<div n="lb"/>Bühler<sup>35</sup> was inclined to interpret as a proof of landowning.
<div n="lb"/>The evidence is, however, inadequate to prove what is sought.
<div n="lb"/>It is not denied that gradually the king came to be vaguely con-
<div n="lb"/>ceived — as the English king still is — as lord of all the land in a
<div n="lb"/>proprietorial sense, but it is far more probable that such an idea
<div n="lb"/>was only a gradual development than that it was primitive.
<div n="lb"/>The power of devouring the people is a political power, not a
<div n="lb"/>right of ownership; precisely the same feature can be traced in
<div n="lb"/>South Africa,<sup>36</sup> where the chief can deprive a man arbitrarily of
<div n="lb"/>his land, though the land is really owned by the native. The
<div n="lb"/>matter is ultimately to some extent one of terminology, but the
<div n="lb"/>parallel cases are in favour of distinguishing between the
<div n="lb"/>political rights of the crown, which can be transferred by way
<div n="lb"/>of a grant, and the rights of ownership. Hopkins<sup>37</sup> thinks
<div n="lb"/>that the gifts of land to priests, which seems to be the first
<div n="lb"/>sign of land transactions in the Brāhmaṇas, was an actual gift
<div n="lb"/>of land; it may have been so in many cases, but it may easily
<div n="lb"/>also have been the grant of a superiority: the Epic grants are
<div n="lb"/>hardly decisive one way or the other.

<div n="lb"/>for his consecration, see {@Rājasūya.@} A-rāja-tā, ‘lack of a king,’

<div n="lb"/>passage; the term may originally have applied to all the nobles
<div n="lb"/>irrespective of kingly power. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup>
<div n="lb"/>the Rājanya is different from the Rājaputra, who is literally a
<div n="lb"/>son of the king. The functions and place of the Rājanya are
<div n="lb"/>described under {@Kṣatriya,@} which expression later normally
<div n="lb"/>takes the place of Rājanya as a designation for the ruling class.
<div n="lb"/>His high place is shown by the fact that in the Taittirīya
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitā<sup>3</sup> he is ranked with the learned Brahmin and the
[Page2-217+ 37]
<div n="lb"/>{@Grāmaṇī@} (who was a {@Vaiśya@}) as having reached the height of

<div n="lb"/>either meaning is abnormal, for if Vadhū never elsewhere
[Page2-240+ 44]
<div n="lb"/>means a female animal (from {%vah,%} to ‘draw’ a cart), neither does
<div n="lb"/>it denote a slave: as the passage refers to a gift of fifty Vadhūs

<div n="lb"/>Zimmer sees in all cases a reference to slaves in the chariots or

<div n="lb"/>literature, but it is not possible to deduce any clear information

<div n="lb"/>colours, or as to the principle on which his distinctions were based.
<div n="lb"/>The Rigveda seems to show that red or yellow colours were

<div n="lb"/>‘dark’ is denoted by {%kṛṣṇa,%} ‘white’ or ‘light-coloured’ by {%śukla%}
<div n="lb"/>or {%śveta.%} ‘Black’ seems to be meant in one passage of the

<div n="lb"/>by {%śyāma.%}<sup>5</sup> The sense of {%nīla%}<sup>6</sup> is doubtful, perhaps ‘dark-blue,’
<div n="lb"/>‘bluish-black.’ The series of words {%hari, hariṇa, harit, harita,%}
<div n="lb"/>seems, on the whole, to denote ‘yellow,’ but ‘green’ is also a
<div n="lb"/>possible rendering, since the epithet is used of the frog.<sup>7</sup>
<div n="lb"/>‘Brown’ is certainly the meaning of {%babhru,%} which is used of
<div n="lb"/>the {@Vibhītaka@} nut (see {@Akṣa@}). ‘Reddish-brown’ seems to be
<div n="lb"/>the tinge implied by {%kapila%}<sup>8</sup> (‘monkey-coloured’), while {%piṅgala%}
<div n="lb"/>appears to denote a shade of brown in which yellow pre-

2. {@Varṇa@}¦ (lit. ‘colour’) in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> is applied to denote
<div n="lb"/>classes of men, the {@Dāsa@} and the Āryan Varṇa being contrasted,
<div n="lb"/>as other passages<sup>2</sup> show, on account of colour. But this use is
<div n="lb"/>confined to distinguishing two colours: in this respect the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda differs fundamentally from the later Saṃhitās and
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇas,<sup>3</sup> where the four castes ({%varṇāḥ%}) are already fully
<div n="lb"/>recognized.
<div n="P"/>{%(a) Caste in the Rigveda.%} — The use of the term Varṇa is not,
<div n="lb"/>of course, conclusive for the question whether caste existed
<div n="lb"/>in the Rigveda. In one sense it must be admitted to have
<div n="lb"/>existed: the Puruṣa-sūkta, ‘hymn of man,’ in the tenth
[Page2-248+ 49]
<div n="lb"/>Maṇḍala<sup>4</sup> clearly contemplates the division of mankind into
<div n="lb"/>four classes — the Brāhmaṇa, Rājanya, Vaiśya, and Śūdra. But
<div n="lb"/>the hymn being admittedly late,<sup>5</sup> its evidence is not cogent for
<div n="lb"/>the bulk of the Rigveda. Zimmer<sup>6</sup> has with great force com-
<div n="lb"/>batted the view that the Rigveda was produced in a society
<div n="lb"/>that knew the caste system. He points out that the Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇas<sup>7</sup> show us the Vedic Indians on the Indus as unbrah-
<div n="lb"/>minized, and not under the caste system; he argues that the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda was the product of tribes living in the Indus region
<div n="lb"/>and the Panjab; later on a part of this people, who had
<div n="lb"/>wandered farther east, developed the peculiar civilization of the
<div n="lb"/>caste system. He adopts the arguments of Muir,<sup>8</sup> derived
<div n="lb"/>from the study of the data of the Rigveda, viz.: that ({%a%}) the
<div n="lb"/>four castes appear only in the late Puruṣasūkta; ({%b%}) the term
<div n="lb"/>Varṇa, as shown above, covers the three highest castes of later
<div n="lb"/>times, and is only contrasted with Dāsa; ({%c%}) that Brāhmaṇa is
<div n="lb"/>rare in the Rigveda, Kṣatriya occurs seldom,<sup>9</sup> Rājanya only in
<div n="lb"/>the Puruṣasūkta, where too, alone, Vaiśya and Śūdra are
<div n="lb"/>found; ({%d%}) that Brahman denotes at first ‘poet,’ ‘sage,’ and
<div n="lb"/>then ‘officiating priest,’ or still later a special class of priest;
<div n="lb"/>({%e%}) that in some only of the passages<sup>10</sup> where it occurs does
<div n="lb"/>Brahman denote a ‘priest by profession,’ while in others it
<div n="lb"/>denotes something peculiar to the individual, designating a
<div n="lb"/>person distinguished for genius or virtue, or specially chosen to
<div n="lb"/>receive divine inspiration.<sup>11</sup> Brāhmaṇa, on the other hand, as
<div n="lb"/>Muir admits,<sup>12</sup> already denotes a hereditary professional priest-
<div n="lb"/>hood.
<div n="P"/>Zimmer connects the change from the casteless system of the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda to the elaborate system of the Yajurveda with the
[Page2-249+ 46]
<div n="lb"/>advance of the Vedic Indians to the east, comparing the Ger-
<div n="lb"/>manic invasions that transformed the German tribes into
<div n="lb"/>monarchies closely allied with the church. The needs of a
<div n="lb"/>conquering people evoke the monarch; the lesser princes sink
<div n="lb"/>to the position of nobles; for repelling the attacks of aborigines
<div n="lb"/>or of other Āryan tribes, and for quelling the revolts of the
<div n="lb"/>subdued population, the state requires a standing army in the
<div n="lb"/>shape of the armed retainers of the king, and beside the nobility
<div n="lb"/>of the lesser princes arises that of the king's chief retainers,
<div n="lb"/>as the Thegns supplemented the Gesiths of the Anglo-Saxon
<div n="lb"/>monarchies.<sup>13</sup> At the same time the people ceased to take
<div n="lb"/>part in military matters, and under climatic influences
<div n="lb"/>left the conduct of war to the nobility and their retainers,
<div n="lb"/>devoting themselves to agriculture, pastoral pursuits, and
<div n="lb"/>trade. But the advantage won by the nobles over the
<div n="lb"/>people was shared by them with the priesthood, the
<div n="lb"/>origin of whose power lies in the Purohitaship, as Roth
<div n="lb"/>first saw.<sup>14</sup>
<div n="P"/>Originally the prince could sacrifice for himself and the
<div n="lb"/>people, but the Rigveda<sup>15</sup> itself shows cases, like those of
<div n="lb"/>{@Viśvāmitra@} and {@Vasiṣṭha@} illustrating forcibly the power of the
<div n="lb"/>Purohita, though at the same time the right of the noble to act
<div n="lb"/>as Purohita is seen in the case of {@Devāpi Ārṣṭiṣeṇa.@}<sup>16</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>Brahmins saw their opportunity, through the Purohitaship, of
<div n="lb"/>gaining practical power during the confusion and difficulties of
<div n="lb"/>the wars of invasion, and secured it, though only after many
<div n="lb"/>struggles, the traces of which are seen in the Epic tradition.<sup>17</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The Atharvaveda<sup>18</sup> also preserves relics of these conflicts in its
<div n="lb"/>narration of the ruin of the {@Sṛñjayas@} because of oppressing
<div n="lb"/>Brahmins, and besides other hymns of the Atharvaveda (viii-
<div n="lb"/>xii), the Śatarudriya litany of the Yajurveda<sup>19</sup> reflects the
<div n="lb"/>period of storm and stress when the aboriginal population was
[Page2-250+ 56]
<div n="lb"/>still seething with discontent, and Rudra was worshipped as
<div n="lb"/>the patron god of all sorts of evil doers.<sup>20</sup>
<div n="P"/>This version of the development of caste has received a good
<div n="lb"/>deal of acceptance in its main outlines, and it may almost be
<div n="lb"/>regarded as the recognized version.<sup>21</sup> It has, however, always
<div n="lb"/>been opposed by some scholars, such as Haug,<sup>22</sup> Kern,<sup>23</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Ludwig,<sup>24</sup> and more recently by Oldenberg<sup>25</sup> and by Geldner.<sup>26</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The matter may be to some extent simplified by recognizing
<div n="lb"/>at once that the caste system is one that has progressively
<div n="lb"/>developed, and that it is not legitimate to see in the Rigveda
<div n="lb"/>the full caste system even of the Yajurveda; but at the same
<div n="lb"/>time it is difficult to doubt that the system was already well on
<div n="lb"/>its way to general acceptance. The argument from the non-
<div n="lb"/>brahminical character of the {@Vrātyas@} of the Indus and Panjab
<div n="lb"/>loses its force when it is remembered that there is much
<div n="lb"/>evidence in favour of placing the composition of the bulk of the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda, especially the books<sup>27</sup> in which {@Sudās@} appears with
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra, in the east, the later {@Madhyadeśa,@} a
<div n="lb"/>view supported by Pischel,<sup>28</sup> Geldner,<sup>29</sup> Hopkins,<sup>30</sup> and Mac-
<div n="lb"/>donell.<sup>31</sup> Nor is it possible to maintain that Brahman in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda merely means a ‘poet’ or ‘sage.’ It is admitted by
<div n="lb"/>Muir that in some passages it must mean a hereditary pro-
<div n="lb"/>fession; in fact, there is not a single passage in which it occurs
<div n="lb"/>where the sense of ‘priest’ is not allowable, since the priest
<div n="lb"/>was of course the singer. Moreover, there are traces in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda of the threefold<sup>32</sup> or fourfold<sup>33</sup> division of the people
[Page2-251+ 41]
<div n="lb"/>into {%brahma, kṣatram,%} and {%viśaḥ,%} or into the three classes and
<div n="lb"/>the servile population. Nor even in respect to the later period,
<div n="lb"/>any more than to the Rigveda, is the view correct that regards
<div n="lb"/>the Vaiśyas as not taking part in war. The Rigveda evidently<sup>34</sup>
<div n="lb"/>knows of no restriction of war to a nobility and its retainers,
<div n="lb"/>but the late Atharvaveda<sup>35</sup> equally classes the folk with the
<div n="lb"/>{%bala,%} ‘power,’ representing the Viś as associated with the {@Sabhā,@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Samiti,@} and {@Senā,@} the assemblies of the people and the armed
<div n="lb"/>host. Zimmer<sup>36</sup> explains these references as due to tradition
<div n="lb"/>only; but this is hardly a legitimate argument, resting, as it
<div n="lb"/>does, on the false assumption that only a Kṣatriya can fight.
<div n="lb"/>But it is (see {@Kṣatriya@}) very doubtful whether Kṣatriya means
<div n="lb"/>anything more than a member of the nobility, though later, in
<div n="lb"/>the Epic, it included the retainers of the nobility, who increased
<div n="lb"/>in numbers with the growth of military monarchies, and though
<div n="lb"/>later the ordinary people did not necessarily take part in wars,
<div n="lb"/>an abstention that is, however, much exaggerated if it is treated
<div n="lb"/>as an absolute one. The Kṣatriyas were no doubt a hereditary
<div n="lb"/>body; monarchy was already hereditary (see {@Rājan@}), and it is
<div n="lb"/>admitted that the Śūdras were a separate body: thus all the
<div n="lb"/>elements of the caste system were already in existence. The
<div n="lb"/>Purohita, indeed, was a person of great importance, but it is
<div n="lb"/>clear, as Oldenberg<sup>37</sup> urges, that he was not the creator of the
<div n="lb"/>power of the priesthood, but owed his position, and the influence
<div n="lb"/>he could in consequence exert, to the fact that the sacrifice
<div n="lb"/>required for its proper performance the aid of a hereditary
<div n="lb"/>priest in whose possession was the traditional sacred know-
<div n="lb"/>ledge.
<div n="P"/>Nor can any argument for the non-existence of the caste
<div n="lb"/>system be derived from cases like that of {@Devāpi.@} For, in the
<div n="lb"/>first place, the Upaniṣads show kings in the exercise of the
<div n="lb"/>priestly functions of learning and teaching, and the Upaniṣads
<div n="lb"/>are certainly contemporaneous with an elaborated caste system.
<div n="lb"/>In the second place the Rigvedic evidence is very weak, for
<div n="lb"/>Devāpi, who certainly acts as Purohita, is not stated in the
[Page2-252+ 61]
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda to be a prince at all, though Yāska<sup>38</sup> calls him a
<div n="lb"/>Kauravya; the hymns attributed to kings and others cannot be
<div n="lb"/>vindicated for them by certain evidence, though here, again,
<div n="lb"/>the Brāhmaṇas do not scruple to recognize Rājanyarṣis, or
<div n="lb"/>‘royal sages’; and the famous Viśvāmitra shows in the Rigveda
<div n="lb"/>no sign of the royal character which the Brāhmaṇas insist
<div n="lb"/>on fastening on him in the shape of royal descent in the line of
<div n="lb"/>{@Jahnu.@}<sup>39</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%(b) Caste in the later Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas.%} — The relation
<div n="lb"/>between the later and the earlier periods of the Vedic history
<div n="lb"/>of caste must probably be regarded in the main as the
<div n="lb"/>hardening of a system already formed by the time of the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda.
<div n="P"/>1. {%The Names of the Castes.%} — The most regular names are
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa, Rājanya, Vaiśya, and Śūdra,<sup>40</sup> or later Brāhmaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>Kṣatriya, Vaiśya, and Śūdra.<sup>41</sup> There are many other variants:
<div n="lb"/>Brahman, Kṣatra, Śūdrāryau;<sup>42</sup> Brahman, Rājanya, Śūdra,
<div n="lb"/>Ārya;<sup>43</sup> Brahman, Rājanya, Vaiśya, Śūdra;<sup>44</sup> Brāhmaṇa, Rājan,
<div n="lb"/>Viśya, Śūdra;<sup>45</sup> Deva, Rājan, Śūdra, Ārya;<sup>46</sup> and Brahman,
<div n="lb"/>Kṣatra, Viś, and Śūdra.<sup>47</sup> In other cases the fourth class is repre-
<div n="lb"/>sented by a special member: Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya, Vaiśya, and
<div n="lb"/>Cāṇḍāla.<sup>48</sup> Often only the three upper classes are mentioned,
<div n="lb"/>as Brāhmaṇa, Rājanya, Vaiśya;<sup>49</sup> Brahman, Kṣatram, Viś,<sup>50</sup>
[Page2-253+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>etc.<sup>51</sup> Three castes — Brāhmaṇa, Rājan, Śūdra — are mentioned
<div n="lb"/>in the Atharvaveda,<sup>52</sup> and two castes are repeatedly men-
<div n="lb"/>tioned together, either Brahman and Kṣatra, or Kṣatra and
<div n="lb"/>Viś.<sup>53</sup>
<div n="P"/>2. {%The Relation of the Castes.%} — The ritual literature is full of
<div n="lb"/>minute differences respecting the castes. Thus, for example,
<div n="lb"/>the Śatapatha prescribes different sizes of funeral mounds for
<div n="lb"/>the four castes,<sup>54</sup> Different modes of address are laid down for
<div n="lb"/>the four castes,<sup>55</sup> as {%ehi,%} ‘approach’; {%āgaccha,%} ‘come’; {%ādrava,%}
<div n="lb"/>‘run up’; {%ādhāva,%} ‘hasten up,’ which differ in degrees of
<div n="lb"/>politeness. The representatives of the four castes are dedicated
<div n="lb"/>at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) to different deities.<sup>56</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The Sūtras have many similar rules.<sup>57</sup>
<div n="P"/>But the three upper castes in some respects differ markedly
<div n="lb"/>from the fourth, the Śūdras. The latter are in the Śatapatha
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa<sup>58</sup> declared not fit to be addressed by a Dīkṣita,
<div n="lb"/>‘consecrated person,’ and no Śūdra is to milk the cow whose
<div n="lb"/>milk is to be used for the Agnihotra<sup>59</sup> (‘fire-oblation’). On the
<div n="lb"/>other hand, in certain passages, the Śūdra is given a place in
<div n="lb"/>the Soma sacrifice,<sup>60</sup> and in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>61</sup> there
<div n="lb"/>are given formulæ for the placing of the sacrificial fire not only
<div n="lb"/>for the three upper castes, but also for the {@Rathakāra,@}
[Page2-254+ 57]
<div n="lb"/>‘chariot-maker.’ Again, in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>62</sup> the Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa is opposed as ‘eater of the oblation’ to the members of
<div n="lb"/>the other three castes.
<div n="P"/>The characteristics of the several castes are given under
<div n="lb"/>{@Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya@} and {@Rājan, Vaiśya, Śūdra:@} they may be
<div n="lb"/>briefly summed up as follows: The Viś forms the basis of the
<div n="lb"/>state on which the Brahman and Kṣatra rest;<sup>63</sup> the Brahman
<div n="lb"/>and Kṣatra are superior to the Viś;<sup>64</sup> while all three classes are
<div n="lb"/>superior to the Śūdras. The real power of the state rested with
<div n="lb"/>the king and his nobles, with their retainers, who may be
<div n="lb"/>deemed the Kṣatriya element. Engaged in the business of the
<div n="lb"/>protection of the country, its administration, the decision of
<div n="lb"/>legal cases, and in war, the nobles subsisted, no doubt, on the
<div n="lb"/>revenues in kind levied from the people, the king granting to
<div n="lb"/>them villages (see {@Grāma@}) for their maintenance, while some of
<div n="lb"/>them, no doubt, had lands of their own cultivated for them by
<div n="lb"/>slaves or by tenants. The states were seemingly small:<sup>65</sup> there
<div n="lb"/>are no clear signs of any really large kingdoms, despite the
<div n="lb"/>mention of {@Mahārājas.@} The people, engaged in agriculture,
<div n="lb"/>pastoral pursuits, and trade ({@Vaṇij@}), paid tribute to the king
<div n="lb"/>and nobles for the protection afforded them. That, as Baden-
<div n="lb"/>Powell suggests,<sup>66</sup> they were not themselves agriculturists is
<div n="lb"/>probably erroneous; some might be landowners on a large
<div n="lb"/>scale, and draw their revenues from Śūdra tenants, or even
<div n="lb"/>Āryan tenants, but that the people as a whole were in this
[Page2-255+ 70]
<div n="lb"/>position is extremely unlikely.<sup>67</sup> In war the people shared
<div n="lb"/>the conflicts of the nobles, for there was not yet any absolute
<div n="lb"/>separation of the functions of the several classes. The priests
<div n="lb"/>may be divided into two classes — the Purohitas of the kings,
<div n="lb"/>who guided their employers by their counsel, and were in a
<div n="lb"/>position to acquire great influence in the state, as it is evident
<div n="lb"/>they actually did, and the ordinary priests who led quiet lives,
<div n="lb"/>except when they were engaged on some great festival of a king
<div n="lb"/>or a wealthy noble.<sup>68</sup>
<div n="P"/>The relations and functions of the castes are well summed up
<div n="lb"/>in a passage of the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>69</sup> which treats of them
<div n="lb"/>as opposed to the Kṣatriya. The Brāhmaṇa is a receiver of
<div n="lb"/>gifts ({%ā-dāyī%}), a drinker of Soma ({%ā-pāyī%}), a seeker of food
<div n="lb"/>({%āvasāyī%}),<sup>70</sup> and liable to removal at will ({%yathākāma-prayāpyaḥ%}).<sup>71</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The Vaiśya is tributary to another ({%anyasya balikṛt%}), to be lived
<div n="lb"/>on by another ({%anyasyādyaḥ%}), and to be oppressed at will ({%yathā-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%kāma-jyeyaḥ%}).<sup>72</sup> The Śūdra is the servant of another ({%anyasya%}
<div n="lb"/>{%preṣyaḥ%}), to be expelled at will ({%kāmotthāpyaḥ%}), and to be slain
[Page2-256+ 54]
<div n="lb"/>at pleasure ({%yathākāma-vadhyaḥ%}).<sup>73</sup> The descriptions seem
<div n="lb"/>calculated to show the relation of each of the castes to the
<div n="lb"/>Rājanya. Even the Brāhmaṇa he can control, whilst the
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśya is his inferior and tributary, whom he can remove
<div n="lb"/>without cause from his land,<sup>74</sup> but who is still free, and whom
<div n="lb"/>he cannot maim or slay without due process. The Śūdra has
<div n="lb"/>no rights of property or life against the noble, especially the
<div n="lb"/>king.
<div n="P"/>The passage is a late one, and the high place of the Kṣatriya
<div n="lb"/>is to some extent accounted for by this fact. It is clear that in
<div n="lb"/>the course of time the Vaiśya fell more and more in position
<div n="lb"/>with the hardening of the divisions of caste. Weber<sup>75</sup> shows
<div n="lb"/>reason for believing that the Vājapeya sacrifice, a festival of
<div n="lb"/>which a chariot race forms an integral part,<sup>76</sup> was, as the
<div n="lb"/>Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra<sup>77</sup> says, once a sacrifice for a Vaiśya,
<div n="lb"/>as well as for a priest or king. But the king, too, had to suffer
<div n="lb"/>diminution of his influence at the hands of the priest: the
<div n="lb"/>Taittirīya texts<sup>78</sup> show that the Vājapeya was originally a lesser
<div n="lb"/>sacrifice which, in the case of a king, was followed by the
<div n="lb"/>Rājasūya, or consecration of him as an overlord of lesser kings,
<div n="lb"/>and in that of the Brahmin by the Bṛhaspatisava, a festival
<div n="lb"/>celebrated on his appointment as a royal Purohita. But the
<div n="lb"/>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>79</sup> exalts the Vājapeya, in which a priest
<div n="lb"/>could be the sacrificer, over the Rājasūya, from which he was
<div n="lb"/>excluded, and identifies it with the Bṛhaspatisava, a clear piece
<div n="lb"/>of juggling in the interests of the priestly pretentions. But we
<div n="lb"/>must not overestimate the value of such passages, or the
<div n="lb"/>exaltation of the Purohita in the later books of the Śatapatha
[Page2-257+ 60]
<div n="lb"/>and Aitareya Brāhmaṇas as evidence of a real growth in the
<div n="lb"/>priestly power: these books represent the views of the priests
<div n="lb"/>of what their own powers should be, and to some extent were in
<div n="lb"/>the Madhyadeśa. Another side of the picture is presented in
<div n="lb"/>the Pāli literature,<sup>80</sup> which, belonging to a later period than the
<div n="lb"/>Vedic, undoubtedly underestimates the position of the priests;
<div n="lb"/>while the Epic,<sup>81</sup> more nearly contemporaneous with the later
<div n="lb"/>Vedic period, displays, despite all priestly redaction, the temporal
<div n="lb"/>superiority of the nobility in clear light.
<div n="P"/>Although clear distinctions were made between the different
<div n="lb"/>castes, there is little trace in Vedic literature of one of the
<div n="lb"/>leading characteristics of the later system, the impurity com-
<div n="lb"/>municated by the touch or contact of the inferior castes,<sup>82</sup>
<div n="lb"/>which is seen both directly in the purification rendered
<div n="lb"/>necessary in case of contact with a Śūdra, and indirectly in the
<div n="lb"/>prohibition of eating in company with men of lower caste.<sup>83</sup> It
<div n="lb"/>is true that prohibition of eating in company with others does
<div n="lb"/>appear,<sup>84</sup> but not in connexion with caste: its purpose is to
<div n="lb"/>preserve the peculiar sanctity of those who perform a certain
<div n="lb"/>rite or believe in a certain doctrine; for persons who eat of the
<div n="lb"/>same food together, according to primitive thought, acquire
<div n="lb"/>the same characteristics and enter into a sacramental com-
<div n="lb"/>munion. But Vedic literature does not yet show that to
<div n="lb"/>take food from an inferior caste was forbidden as destroying
[Page2-258+ 58]
<div n="lb"/>purity.<sup>85</sup> Nor, of course, has the caste system developed the
<div n="lb"/>constitution with a head, a council, and common festivals
<div n="lb"/>which the modern caste has; for such an organization is not
<div n="lb"/>found even in the Epic or in the Pāli literature.<sup>86</sup> The Vedic
<div n="lb"/>characteristics of caste are heredity, pursuit of a common
<div n="lb"/>occupation, and restriction on intermarriage.
<div n="P"/>3. {%Restrictions on Intermarriage.%} — Arrian, in his {%Indica,%}<sup>87</sup>
<div n="lb"/>probably on the authority of Megasthenes, makes the prohibi-
<div n="lb"/>tion of marriage between <lang n="greek"></lang>, no doubt ‘castes,’ a characteristic
<div n="lb"/>of Indian life. The evidence of Pāli literature<sup>88</sup> is in favour of
<div n="lb"/>this view, though it shows that a king could marry whom he
<div n="lb"/>wished, and could make his son by that wife the heir apparent.
<div n="lb"/>But it equally shows that there were others who held that not
<div n="lb"/>the father's but the mother's rank determined the social
<div n="lb"/>standing of the son. Though Manu<sup>89</sup> recognizes the possibility
<div n="lb"/>of marriage with the next lower caste as producing legitimate
<div n="lb"/>children, still he condemns the marriage of an Āryan with
<div n="lb"/>a woman of lower caste. The Pāraskara Gṛhya Sūtra<sup>90</sup> allows
<div n="lb"/>the marriage of a Kṣatriya with a wife of his own caste or of
<div n="lb"/>the lower caste, of a Brahmin with a wife of his own caste or
<div n="lb"/>of the two lower classes, and of a Vaiśya with a Vaiśya wife
<div n="lb"/>only. But it quotes the opinion of others that all of them can
<div n="lb"/>marry a Śūdra wife, while other authorities condemn the
<div n="lb"/>marriage with a Śūdra wife in certain circumstances, which
<div n="lb"/>implies that in other cases it might be justified.<sup>91</sup> The earlier
[Page2-259+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>literature bears out this impression: much stress is laid on
<div n="lb"/>descent from a Ṛṣi, and on purity of descent;<sup>92</sup> but there is
<div n="lb"/>other evidence for the view that even a Brāhmaṇa need not be
<div n="lb"/>of pure lineage. {@Kavaṣa@} Ailūṣa is taunted with being the son
<div n="lb"/>of a Dāsī, ‘slave woman,’<sup>93</sup> and {@Vatsa@} was accused of being a
<div n="lb"/>Śūdrā's son, but established his purity by walking unhurt
<div n="lb"/>through the flames of a fire ordeal.<sup>94</sup> He who is learned
<div n="lb"/>({%śuśruvān%}) is said to be a Brāhmaṇa, descended from a Ṛṣi
<div n="lb"/>({%ārṣeya%}), in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā;<sup>95</sup> and {@Satyakāma,@} son of
<div n="lb"/>{@Jabālā,@} was accepted as a pupil by {@Hāridrumata@} Gautama,
<div n="lb"/>though he could not name his father.<sup>96</sup> The Kāṭhaka Saṃ-
<div n="lb"/>hitā<sup>97</sup> says that knowledge is all-important, not descent. But
<div n="lb"/>all this merely goes to show that there was a measure of laxity
<div n="lb"/>in the hereditary character of caste, not that it was not based
<div n="lb"/>on heredity. The Yajurveda Saṃhitās<sup>98</sup> recognize the illicit
<div n="lb"/>union of Ārya and Śūdrā, and {%vice versa:%} it is not unlikely that
<div n="lb"/>if illicit unions took place, legal marriage was quite possible.
<div n="lb"/>The Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>99</sup> indeed, recognizes such a case in
<div n="lb"/>that of {@Dīrghatamas,@} son of the slave girl Uśij, if we may
<div n="lb"/>adopt the description of Uśij given in the Bṛhaddevatā.<sup>100</sup>
<div n="P"/>In a hymn of the Atharvaveda<sup>101</sup> extreme claims are put
[Page2-260+ 54]
<div n="lb"/>forward for the Brāhmaṇa, who alone is a true husband and
<div n="lb"/>the real husband, even if the woman has had others, a Rājanya
<div n="lb"/>or a Vaiśya: a Śūdra husband is not mentioned, probably on
<div n="lb"/>purpose.<sup>102</sup> The marriage of Brāhmaṇas with Rājanya women
<div n="lb"/>is illustrated by the cases of {@Sukanyā,@} daughter of king
<div n="lb"/>{@Śaryāta,@} who married {@Cyavana,@}<sup>103</sup> and of {@Rathavīti's@} daughter,
<div n="lb"/>who married {@Śyāvāśva.@}<sup>104</sup>
<div n="P"/>4. {%Occupation and Caste.%} — The Greek authorities<sup>105</sup> and the
<div n="lb"/>evidence of the Jātakas<sup>106</sup> concur in showing it to have been
<div n="lb"/>the general rule that each caste was confined to its own
<div n="lb"/>occupations, but that the Brāhmaṇas did engage in many
<div n="lb"/>professions beside that of simple priest, while all castes gave
<div n="lb"/>members to the Śramaṇas, or homeless ascetics. The Jātakas<sup>107</sup>
<div n="lb"/>recognize the Brahmins as engaged in all sorts of occupations,
<div n="lb"/>as merchants, traders, agriculturists, and so forth. Matters are
<div n="lb"/>somewhat simpler in Vedic literature, where the Brāhmaṇas
<div n="lb"/>and Kṣatriyas appear as practically confined to their own pro-
<div n="lb"/>fessions of sacrifice and military or administrative functions.
<div n="lb"/>Ludwig<sup>108</sup> sees in {@Dīrghaśravas@} in the Rigveda<sup>109</sup> a Brahmin
<div n="lb"/>reduced by indigence to acting as a merchant, as allowed even
<div n="lb"/>later by the Sūtra literature; but this is not certain, though it
<div n="lb"/>is perfectly possible. More interesting is the question how far
<div n="lb"/>the Kṣatriyas practised the duties of priests; the evidence here
<div n="lb"/>is conflicting. The best known case is, of course, that of
<div n="lb"/>{@Viśvāmitra.@} In the Rigveda he appears merely as a priest
<div n="lb"/>who is attached to the court of {@Sudās,@} king of the {@Tṛtsus;@} but
<div n="lb"/>in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>110</sup> he is called a king, a descendant
<div n="lb"/>of {@Jahnu,@} and the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>111</sup> refers to {@Śunaḥśepa's@}
[Page2-261+ 52]
<div n="lb"/>succeeding, through his adoption by Viśvāmitra, to the divine
<div n="lb"/>lore ({%daiva veda%}) of the {@Gāthins@} and the lordship of the Jahnus.
<div n="lb"/>That in fact this tradition is correct seems most improbable,
<div n="lb"/>but it serves at least to illustrate the existence of seers of royal
<div n="lb"/>origin. Such figures appear more than once in the Pañcaviṃśa
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa,<sup>112</sup> which knows the technical terms {@Rājanyarṣi@} and
<div n="lb"/>{@Devarājan@} corresponding to the later Rājarṣi, ‘royal sage.’ The
<div n="lb"/>Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>113</sup> says of one who knows a certain
<div n="lb"/>doctrine, ‘being a king he becomes a seer’ ({%rājā sann ṛṣir%}
<div n="lb"/>{%bhavati%}), and the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa<sup>114</sup> applies the
<div n="lb"/>term Rājanya to a Brāhmaṇa. Again, it is argued that {@Devāpi@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Ārṣṭiṣeṇa,@} who acted as Purohita, according to the Rigveda,<sup>115</sup>
<div n="lb"/>for {@Śantanu,@} was a prince, as Yāska<sup>116</sup> says or implies he
<div n="lb"/>was.<sup>117</sup> But this assumption seems to be only an error of
<div n="lb"/>Yāska's. Since nothing in the Rigveda alludes to any relation-
<div n="lb"/>ship, it is impossible to accept Sieg's view<sup>118</sup> that the Rigveda
<div n="lb"/>recognizes the two as brothers, but presents the fact of a prince
<div n="lb"/>acting the part of Purohita as unusual and requiring explanation.
<div n="lb"/>The principle, however, thus accepted by Sieg as to princes in
<div n="lb"/>the Rigveda seems sound enough. Again, Muir<sup>119</sup> has argued
<div n="lb"/>that Hindu tradition, as shown in Sāyaṇa,<sup>120</sup> regards many
<div n="lb"/>hymns of the Rigveda as composed by royal personages, but he
<div n="lb"/>admits that in many cases the ascription is wrong; it may be
<div n="lb"/>added that in the case of {@Pṛthī Vainya,@} where the hymn<sup>121</sup>
<div n="lb"/>ascribed to him seems to be his, it is not shown in the hymn
<div n="lb"/>itself that he is other than a seer; the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>122</sup>
<div n="lb"/>calls him a king, but that is probably of no more value than
<div n="lb"/>the later tradition as to Viśvāmitra. The case of {@Viśvantara@}
[Page2-262+ 54]
<div n="lb"/>and the {@Śyāparṇas@} mentioned in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>123</sup> has
<div n="lb"/>been cited<sup>124</sup> as that of a king sacrificing without priestly aid,
<div n="lb"/>but the interpretation is quite uncertain, while the parallel of
<div n="lb"/>the {@Kaśyapas, Asitamṛgas,@} and {@Bhūtavīras@} mentioned in the
<div n="lb"/>course of the narrative renders it highly probable that the king
<div n="lb"/>had other priests to carry out the sacrifice.
<div n="P"/>Somewhat different are a series of other cases found in the
<div n="lb"/>Upaniṣads, where the Brahma doctrine is ascribed to royal
<div n="lb"/>persons. Thus {@Janaka@} is said in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>125</sup>
<div n="lb"/>to have become a Brahman; {@Ajātaśatru@} taught {@Gārgya@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Bālāki;@}<sup>126</sup> {@Pravāhaṇa Jaivali@} instructed {@Śvetaketu Āruṇeya,@}<sup>127</sup>
<div n="lb"/>as well as {@Śilaka Śālāvatya@}<sup>128</sup> and {@Caikitāyana Dālbhya;@}
<div n="lb"/>and {@Aśvapati Kaikeya@} taught Brahmins.<sup>129</sup> It has been
<div n="lb"/>deduced<sup>130</sup> from such passages that the Brahma doctrine was a
<div n="lb"/>product of the Kṣatriyas. This conclusion is, however, entirely
<div n="lb"/>doubtful,<sup>131</sup> for kings were naturally willing to be flattered by
<div n="lb"/>the ascription to them of philosophic activity, and elsewhere<sup>132</sup>
<div n="lb"/>the opinion of a Rājanya is treated with contempt.
<div n="P"/>It is probably a fair deduction that the royal caste did not
<div n="lb"/>much concern itself with the sacred lore of the priests, though
<div n="lb"/>it is not unlikely that individual exceptions occurred. But
<div n="lb"/>that warriors became priests, that an actual change of caste
<div n="lb"/>took place, is quite unproved by a single genuine example.
<div n="lb"/>That it was impossible we cannot say, but it seems not to have
<div n="lb"/>taken place. To be distinguished from a caste change, as Fick<sup>133</sup>
<div n="lb"/>points out, is the fact that a member of any caste could, in the
<div n="lb"/>later period at least, become a Śramaṇa, as is recorded in effect
[Page2-263+ 53]
<div n="lb"/>of many kings in the Epic.<sup>134</sup> Whether the practice is Vedic is
<div n="lb"/>not clear: Yāska<sup>135</sup> records it of Devāpi, but this is not evidence
<div n="lb"/>for times much anterior to the rise of Buddhism.
<div n="P"/>On the other hand, the Brahmins, or at least the Purohitas,
<div n="lb"/>accompanied the princes in battle, and probably, like the
<div n="lb"/>mediæval clergy, were not unprepared to fight,<sup>136</sup> as Vasiṣṭha
<div n="lb"/>and Viśvāmitra seem to have done, and as priests do even in
<div n="lb"/>the Epic from time to time.<sup>137</sup> But a priest cannot be said to
<div n="lb"/>change caste by acting in this way.
<div n="P"/>More generally the possibility of the occurrence of change of
<div n="lb"/>caste may be seen in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>138</sup> where
<div n="lb"/>{@Śyāparṇa Sāyakāyana@} is represented as speaking of his off-
<div n="lb"/>spring as if they could have become the nobles, priests, and
<div n="lb"/>commons of the Śalvas; and in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>139</sup>
<div n="lb"/>where Viśvantara is told that if the wrong offering were made
<div n="lb"/>his children would be of the three other castes. A drunken Ṛṣi
<div n="lb"/>of the Rigveda<sup>140</sup> talks as if he could be converted into a king.
<div n="lb"/>On the other hand, certain kings, such as {@Para Āṭṇāra,@} are
<div n="lb"/>spoken of as performers of Sattras, ‘sacrificial sessions.’<sup>141</sup> As
<div n="lb"/>evidence for caste exchange all this amounts to little; later a
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin might become a king, while the Ṛṣi in the Rigveda is
<div n="lb"/>represented as speaking in a state of intoxication; the great
<div n="lb"/>kings could be called sacrificers if, for the nonce, they were
<div n="lb"/>consecrated ({%dīkṣita%}), and so temporarily became Brahmins.<sup>142</sup>
<div n="lb"/>The hypothetical passages, too, do not help much. It would
<div n="lb"/>be unwise to deny the possibility of caste exchange, but it is
<div n="lb"/>not clearly indicated by any record. Even cases like that of
<div n="lb"/>Satyakāma Jābāla do not go far; for {%ex hypothesi%} that teacher
[Page2-264+ 40]
<div n="lb"/>did not know who his father was, and the latter could quite
<div n="lb"/>well have been a Brahmin.
<div n="P"/>It may therefore be held that the priests and the nobles
<div n="lb"/>practised hereditary occupations, and that either class was a
<div n="lb"/>closed body into which a man must be born. These two
<div n="lb"/>Varṇas may thus be fairly regarded as castes. The Vaiśyas
<div n="lb"/>offer more difficulty, for they practised a great variety of
<div n="lb"/>occupations (see {@Vaiśya@}). Fick<sup>143</sup> concludes that there is no
<div n="lb"/>exact sense in which they can be called a caste, since, in the
<div n="lb"/>Buddhist literature, they were divided into various groups,
<div n="lb"/>which themselves practised endogamy such as the {%gahapatis,%} or
<div n="lb"/>smaller landowners, the {%setthis,%} or large merchants and members
<div n="lb"/>of the various guilds, while there are clear traces<sup>144</sup> in the legal
<div n="lb"/>textbooks of a view that Brāhmaṇa and Kṣatriya stand opposed
<div n="lb"/>to all the other members of the community. But we need
<div n="lb"/>hardly accept this view for Vedic times, when the Vaiśya, the
<div n="lb"/>ordinary freeman of the tribe, formed a class or caste in all
<div n="lb"/>probability, which was severed by its free status from the
<div n="lb"/>Śūdras, and which was severed by its lack of priestly or noble
<div n="lb"/>blood from the two higher classes in the state. It is probably
<div n="lb"/>legitimate to hold that any Vaiśya could marry any member of
<div n="lb"/>the caste, and that the later divisions within the category of
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśyas are growths of divisions parallel with the original
<div n="lb"/>process by which priest and noble had grown into separate
<div n="lb"/>entities. The process can be seen to day when new tribes fall
<div n="lb"/>under the caste system: each class tries to elevate itself in the
<div n="lb"/>social scale by refusing to intermarry with inferior classes on
<div n="lb"/>equal terms — hypergamy is often allowed — and so those Vaiśyas
<div n="lb"/>who acquired wealth in trade ({@Śreṣṭhin@}) or agriculture (the
<div n="lb"/>Pāli Gahapatis) would become distinct, as sub-castes, from the
<div n="lb"/>ordinary Vaiśyas. But it is not legitimate to regard Vaiśya as
<div n="lb"/>a theoretic caste; rather it is an old caste which is in process
<div n="lb"/>of dividing into innumerable sub-castes under influences of
<div n="lb"/>occupation, religion, or geographical situation.
<div n="P"/>Fick<sup>145</sup> denies also that the Śūdras ever formed a single
[Page2-265+ 43]
<div n="lb"/>caste: he regards the term as covering the numerous inferior
<div n="lb"/>races and tribes defeated by the Āryan invaders, but originally
<div n="lb"/>as denoting only one special tribe. It is reasonable to suppose
<div n="lb"/>that Śūdra was the name given by the Vedic Indians to the
<div n="lb"/>nations opposing them, and that these ranked as slaves beside
<div n="lb"/>the three castes — nobles, priests, and people — just as in the
<div n="lb"/>Anglo-Saxon and early German constitution beside the priests,
<div n="lb"/>the {%nobiles%} or eorls, and the {%ingenui,%} ordinary freemen or ceorls,
<div n="lb"/>there was a distinct class of slaves proper; the use of a generic
<div n="lb"/>expression to cover them seems natural, whatever its origin (see
<div n="lb"/>{@Śūdra@}). In the Āryan view a marriage of Śūdras could hardly
<div n="lb"/>be regulated by rules; any Śūdra could wed another, if such a
<div n="lb"/>marriage could be called a marriage at all, for a slave cannot in
<div n="lb"/>early law be deemed to be capable of marriage proper. But
<div n="lb"/>what applied in the early Vedic period became no doubt less
<div n="lb"/>and less applicable later when many aboriginal tribes and
<div n="lb"/>princes must have come into the Āryan community by peaceful
<div n="lb"/>means, or by conquest, without loss of personal liberty, and
<div n="lb"/>when the term Śūdra would cover many sorts of people who
<div n="lb"/>were not really slaves, but were freemen of a humble character
<div n="lb"/>occupied in such functions as supplying the numerous needs of
<div n="lb"/>the village, like the {@Caṇḍālas,@} or tribes living under Āryan
<div n="lb"/>control, or independent, such as the {@Niṣādas.@}
<div n="P"/>But it is also probable that the Śūdras came to include men
<div n="lb"/>of Āryan race, and that the Vedic period saw the degradation
<div n="lb"/>of Āryans to a lower social status. This seems, at any rate, to
<div n="lb"/>have been the case with the {@Rathakāras.@} In the Taittirīya
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa<sup>146</sup> the Rathakāra is placed as a special class along
<div n="lb"/>with the Brāhmaṇas, Rājanyas, and Vaiśyas: this can hardly
<div n="lb"/>be interpreted except to mean that the Rathakāras were not
<div n="lb"/>included in the Āryan classes, though it is just possible that
<div n="lb"/>only a subdivision of the Vaiśyas is meant. There is other
<div n="lb"/>evidence<sup>147</sup> that the Rathakāras were regarded as Śūdras. But
<div n="lb"/>in the Atharvaveda<sup>148</sup> the Rathakāras and the {@Karmāras@}
<div n="lb"/>appear in a position of importance in connexion with the
[Page2-266+ 50]
<div n="lb"/>selection of the king; these two classes are also referred to in
<div n="lb"/>an honourable way in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā;<sup>149</sup> in the Śata-
<div n="lb"/>patha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>150</sup> too, the Rathakāra is mentioned as a
<div n="lb"/>a person of high standing. It is impossible to accept the view
<div n="lb"/>suggested by Fick<sup>151</sup> that these classes were originally non-
<div n="lb"/>Āryan; we must recognize that the Rathakāras, in early Vedic
<div n="lb"/>times esteemed for their skill, later became degraded because of
<div n="lb"/>the growth of the feeling that manual labour was not dignified.
<div n="lb"/>The development of this idea was a departure from the Āryan
<div n="lb"/>conception; it is not unnatural, however undesirable, and has
<div n="lb"/>a faint parallel in the class distinctions of modern Europe.
<div n="lb"/>Similarly, the Karmāra, the {@Takṣan,@}<sup>152</sup> the Carmamna, or
<div n="lb"/>‘tanner,’ the weaver and others, quite dignified occupa-
<div n="lb"/>tions in the Rigveda, are reckoned as Śūdras in the Pāli
<div n="lb"/>texts.<sup>153</sup>
<div n="P"/>The later theory, which appears fully developed in the
<div n="lb"/>Dharma Sūtras,<sup>154</sup> deduces the several castes other than the
<div n="lb"/>original four from the intermarriage of the several castes. This
<div n="lb"/>theory has no justification in the early Vedic literature. In
<div n="lb"/>some cases it is obviously wrong; for example, the {@Sūta@} is said
<div n="lb"/>to be a caste of this kind, whereas it is perfectly clear that if
<div n="lb"/>the Sūtas did form a caste, it was one ultimately due to
<div n="lb"/>occupation. But there is no evidence at all that the Sūtas,
<div n="lb"/>Grāmaṇīs, and other members of occupations were real castes
<div n="lb"/>in the sense that they were endogamic in the early Vedic
<div n="lb"/>period. All that we can say is that there was a steady progress
<div n="lb"/>by which caste after caste was formed, occupation being an
<div n="lb"/>important determining feature, just as in modern times there
<div n="lb"/>are castes bearing names like Gopāla (‘cowherd’) Kaivarta or
<div n="lb"/>Dhīvara (‘fisherman’), and Vaṇij (‘merchant’).<sup>155</sup>
[Page2-267+ 39]
<div n="P"/>Fick<sup>156</sup> finds in the Jātakas mention of a number of occupa-
<div n="lb"/>tions whose members did not form part of any caste at all, such
<div n="lb"/>as the attendants on the court, the actors and dancers who
<div n="lb"/>went from village to village, and the wild tribes that lived in
<div n="lb"/>the mountains, fishermen, hunters, and so on. In Vedic times
<div n="lb"/>these people presumably fell under the conception of Śūdra,
<div n="lb"/>and may have included the {@Parṇaka, Paulkasa, Bainda,@} who
<div n="lb"/>are mentioned with many others in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā
<div n="lb"/>and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa in the list of victims at the
<div n="lb"/>Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’). The slaves also, whom
<div n="lb"/>Fick<sup>157</sup> includes in the same category, were certainly included
<div n="lb"/>in the term Śūdra.
<div n="P"/>5. {%Origin of the Castes.%} — The question of the origin of the
<div n="lb"/>castes presents some difficulty. The ultimate cause of the
<div n="lb"/>extreme rigidity of the caste system, as compared with
<div n="lb"/>the features of any other Āryan society, must probably be
<div n="lb"/>sought in the sharp distinction drawn from the beginning
<div n="lb"/>between the Āryan and the Śūdra. The contrast which the
<div n="lb"/>Vedic Indians felt as existing between themselves and the
<div n="lb"/>conquered population, and which probably rested originally on
<div n="lb"/>the difference of colour between the upper and the lower
<div n="lb"/>classes, tended to accentuate the natural distinctions of birth,
<div n="lb"/>occupation, and locality which normally existed among the
<div n="lb"/>Āryan Indians, but which among other Āryan peoples never
<div n="lb"/>developed into a caste system like that of India. The doctrine
<div n="lb"/>of hypergamy which marks the practical working of the caste
<div n="lb"/>system, seems clearly to point to the feeling that the Āryan
<div n="lb"/>could marry the Śūdrā, but not the Śūdra the Āryā. This
<div n="lb"/>distinction probably lies at the back of all other divisions: its
<div n="lb"/>force may be illustrated by the peculiar state of feeling as to
<div n="lb"/>mixed marriages, for example, in the Southern States of
<div n="lb"/>America and in South Africa, or even in India itself, between
<div n="lb"/>the new invaders from Europe and the mingled population
<div n="lb"/>which now peoples the country. Marriages between persons
<div n="lb"/>of the white and the dark race are disapproved in principle, but
<div n="lb"/>varying degrees of condemnation attach to (1) the marriage of
<div n="lb"/>a man of the white race with a woman of the dark race;
[Page2-268+ 45]
<div n="lb"/>(2) an informal connexion between these two; (3) a marriage
<div n="lb"/>between a woman of the white race and a man of the dark
<div n="lb"/>race; and (4) an informal connexion between these two. Each
<div n="lb"/>category, on the whole, is subject to more severe reprobation
<div n="lb"/>than the preceding one. This race element, it would seem, is
<div n="lb"/>what has converted social divisions into castes. There appears,
<div n="lb"/>then, to be a large element of truth in the theory, best repre-
<div n="lb"/>sented by Risley,<sup>158</sup> which explains caste in the main as a
<div n="lb"/>matter of blood, and which holds that the higher the caste is,
<div n="lb"/>the greater is the proportion of Āryan blood.
<div n="P"/>The chief rival theory is undoubtedly that of Senart,<sup>159</sup>
<div n="lb"/>which places the greatest stress on the Āryan constitution of
<div n="lb"/>the family. According to Senart the Āryan people practised in
<div n="lb"/>affairs of marriage both a rule of exogamy, and one of endogamy.
<div n="lb"/>A man must marry a woman of equal birth, but not one of the
<div n="lb"/>same {%gens,%} according to Roman law as interpreted by Senart
<div n="lb"/>and Kovalevsky;<sup>160</sup> and an Athenian must marry an Athenian
<div n="lb"/>woman, but not one of the same <lang n="greek"></lang>. In India these rules
<div n="lb"/>are reproduced in the form that one must not marry within
<div n="lb"/>the {@Gotra,@} but not without the caste. The theory, though
<div n="lb"/>attractively developed, is not convincing; the Latin and Greek
<div n="lb"/>parallels are not even probably accurate;<sup>161</sup> and in India the
<div n="lb"/>rule forbidding marriage within the Gotra is one which grows;
<div n="lb"/>in strictness as the evidence grows later in date.<sup>162</sup>
<div n="P"/>On the other hand, it is not necessary to deny that the
<div n="lb"/>development of caste may have been helped by the family
<div n="lb"/>traditions of some {%gentes,%} or <lang n="greek"></lang>, or Gotras. The Patricians
<div n="lb"/>of Rome for a long time declined intermarriage with the
<div n="lb"/>plebeians; the Athenian Eupatridai seem to have kept their
<lang n="greek"></lang> pure from contamination by union with lower blood; and
<div n="lb"/>there may well have been noble families among the Vedic
<div n="lb"/>Indians who intermarried only among themselves. The
[Page2-269+ 49]
<div n="lb"/>Germans known to Tacitus<sup>163</sup> were divided into {%nobiles%} and
<div n="lb"/>{%ingenui,%} and the Anglo-Saxons into eorls and ceorls, noble
<div n="lb"/>and non-noble freemen.<sup>164</sup> The origin of nobility need not be
<div n="lb"/>sought in the Vedic period proper, for it may already have
<div n="lb"/>existed. It may have been due to the fact that the king, whom
<div n="lb"/>we must regard as originally elected by the people, was as king
<div n="lb"/>often in close relation with, or regarded as an incarnation of,
<div n="lb"/>the deity;<sup>165</sup> and that hereditary kingship would tend to
<div n="lb"/>increase the tradition of especially sacred blood: thus the
<div n="lb"/>royal family and its offshoots would be anxious to maintain
<div n="lb"/>the purity of their blood. In India, beside the sanctity of the
<div n="lb"/>king, there was the sanctity of the priest. Here we have in
<div n="lb"/>the family exclusiveness of king and nobles, and the similar
<div n="lb"/>exclusiveness of a priesthood which was not celibate, influences
<div n="lb"/>that make for caste, especially when accompanying the deep
<div n="lb"/>opposition between the general folk and the servile aborigines.
<div n="P"/>Caste, once created, naturally developed in different directions.
<div n="lb"/>Nesfield<sup>166</sup> was inclined to see in occupation the one ground of
<div n="lb"/>caste. It is hardly necessary seriously to criticize this view
<div n="lb"/>considered as an ultimate explanation of caste, but it is perfectly
<div n="lb"/>certain that gilds of workers tend to become castes. The
<div n="lb"/>carpenters ({@Takṣan@}), the chariot-makers ({@Rathakāra@}), the fisher-
<div n="lb"/>men ({@Dhaivara@}) and others are clearly of the type of caste, and
<div n="lb"/>the number extends itself as time goes on. But this is not to
<div n="lb"/>say that caste is founded on occupation pure and simple in its
<div n="lb"/>first origin, or that mere difference of occupation would have
<div n="lb"/>produced the system of caste without the interposition of the
<div n="lb"/>fundamental difference between Āryan and Dāsa or Śūdra
<div n="lb"/>blood and colour. This difference rendered increasingly impor-
<div n="lb"/>tant what the history of the Āryan peoples shows us to be
<div n="lb"/>declining, the distinction between the noble and the non-noble
[Page2-270+ 77]
<div n="lb"/>freemen, a distinction not of course ultimate, but one which
<div n="lb"/>seems to have been developed in the Āryan people before the
<div n="lb"/>separation of its various branches.
<div n="P"/>It is well known that the Iranian polity presents a division
<div n="lb"/>of classes comparable in some respects<sup>167</sup> with the Indian
<div n="lb"/>polity. The priests (Atharvas) and warriors (Rathaesthas) are
<div n="lb"/>unmistakably parallel, and the two lower classes seem to
<div n="lb"/>correspond closely to the Pāli Gahapatis, and perhaps to the
<div n="lb"/>Śūdras.<sup>168</sup> But they are certainly not castes in the Indian
<div n="lb"/>sense of the word. There is no probability in the view of
<div n="lb"/>Senart<sup>169</sup> or of Risley<sup>170</sup> that the names of the old classes were
<div n="lb"/>later superimposed artificially on a system of castes that were
<div n="lb"/>different from them in origin. We cannot say that the castes
<div n="lb"/>existed before the classes, and that the classes were borrowed
<div n="lb"/>by India from Iran, as Risley maintains, ignoring the early
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa evidence for the four Varṇas, and treating the
<div n="lb"/>transfer as late. Nor can we say with Senart that the castes
<div n="lb"/>and classes are of independent origin. If there had been no
<div n="lb"/>Varṇa, caste might never have arisen; both colour and class
<div n="lb"/>occupation are needed for a plausible account of the rise of caste.<sup>171</sup>

<div n="lb"/>Fick, {%op. cit.,%} 30-33, who points out

<div n="lb"/>on the practice. Senart, {%Les Castes dans%}
<div n="lb"/>{%l'Inde,%} 48 {%et seq.,%} 212 {%et seq.,%} attributes
<div n="lb"/>great importance to the question of
<div n="lb"/>eating together, and compares the sacri-
<div n="lb"/>ficial meals of the {%gens%} at Rome, where
<div n="lb"/>strangers were excluded (Fustel de
<div n="lb"/>Coulanges, {%La Cité Antique,%} 117). But
<div n="lb"/>this is not conclusive; a caste is not
<div n="lb"/>a {%gens,%} and the {%gens%} excluded strangers
<div n="lb"/>only at a solemn festival, when the
<div n="lb"/>whole {%gens%} renewed its blood kinship.
<div n="lb"/>If we have no evidence exactly estab-
<div n="lb"/>lishing this for the Gotra in early Vedic
<div n="lb"/>literature, we need not hesitate to
<div n="lb"/>believe that in the earliest Vedic period
<div n="lb"/>the Gotra had solemn festivals of union,
<div n="lb"/>and of communication with the dead,
<div n="lb"/>but that again does not explain or
<div n="lb"/>amount to the caste prohibition of
<div n="lb"/>taking food from an inferior.</F>
<F>84) {%E.g.,%} Aitareya Āraṇyaka, v. 3, 3.

<F>85) For a case of objection to eating
<div n="lb"/>food after another, see Chāndogya
<div n="lb"/>Upaniṣad, i. 10, 1. Possibly the idea
<div n="lb"/>there is that eating the food of a chief
<div n="lb"/>is dangerous, since the eater thus enters
<div n="lb"/>into possession of part of his sub-
<div n="lb"/>stance, and consequently at once be-
<div n="lb"/>comes an object of anger to the chief,
<div n="lb"/>as well as of danger to himself; for the
<div n="lb"/>chief may be so full of divine force that
<div n="lb"/>it would be unsafe for an ordinary man
<div n="lb"/>to be assimilated to him — a common
<div n="lb"/>idea in primitive societies. See also

<div n="lb"/>levsky, {%Famille et Propriété Primitives,%}
<div n="lb"/>119; Fustel de Coulanges, {%op. cit.,%} 118,
<div n="lb"/>119). But here again the system may
<div n="lb"/>have applied to the Gotra without its
<div n="lb"/>really explaining the later appearance
<div n="lb"/>of the practice in the caste, and the
<div n="lb"/>absence of the mention of a council in

<div n="lb"/>conclusive against its existence.</F>

<L>2843<pc>2-274<k1>vasizWa<k2>vasizWa
{@Vasiṣṭha@}¦ is the name of one of the most prominent priestly
<div n="lb"/>figures of Vedic tradition. The seventh Maṇḍala of the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda is ascribed to him; this ascription is borne out by the
<div n="lb"/>fact that the Vasiṣṭhas<sup>1</sup> and Vasiṣṭha<sup>2</sup> are frequently mentioned
<div n="lb"/>in that Maṇḍala, besides being sometimes referred to elsewhere.
<div n="lb"/>That by the name Vasiṣṭha a definite individual is always
<div n="lb"/>meant is most improbable, as Oldenberg<sup>3</sup> shows; Vasiṣṭha
<div n="lb"/>must normally mean simply ‘a Vasiṣṭha.’ But it is not
<div n="lb"/>necessary to deny that a real Vasiṣṭha existed, for one hymn<sup>4</sup>
<div n="lb"/>seems to show clear traces of his authorship, and of his assist-
<div n="lb"/>ance to {@Sudās@} against the ten kings.
<div n="P"/>The most important feature of Vasiṣṭha's life was apparently
[Page2-275+ 68]
<div n="lb"/>his hostility to {@Viśvāmitra.@} The latter was certainly<sup>5</sup> at one
<div n="lb"/>time the {@Purohita@} (‘domestic priest’) of Sudās, but he seems
<div n="lb"/>to have been deposed from that post, to have joined Sudās'
<div n="lb"/>enemies, and to have taken part in the onslaught of the kings
<div n="lb"/>against him, for the hymn of Sudās' triumph<sup>4</sup> has clear
<div n="lb"/>references to the ruin Viśvāmitra brought on his allies.<sup>6</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Oldenberg,<sup>7</sup> however, holds that the strife of Viśvāmitra and
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha is not to be found in the Rigveda. On the other
<div n="lb"/>hand, Geldner<sup>8</sup> is hardly right in finding in the Rigveda<sup>9</sup> a
<div n="lb"/>compressed account indicating the rivalry of {@Śakti,@} Vasiṣṭha's
<div n="lb"/>son, with Viśvāmitra, the acquisition by Viśvāmitra of special
<div n="lb"/>skill in speech, and the revenge of Viśvāmitra, who secured the
<div n="lb"/>death of Śakti by Sudās' servants, an account which is more
<div n="lb"/>fully related by Ṣaḍguruśiṣya,<sup>10</sup> which appeared in the Śāṭyāya-
<div n="lb"/>naka,<sup>11</sup> and to which reference seems to be made in the brief
<div n="lb"/>notices of the Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>12</sup> and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa<sup>13</sup> regarding Vasiṣṭha's sons having been slain, and his
<div n="lb"/>overcoming the Saudāsas. But it is important to note that no
<div n="lb"/>mention is made in these authorities of Sudās himself being
<div n="lb"/>actually opposed to Vasiṣṭha, while in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>14</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Vasiṣṭha appears as the Purohita and consecrator of Sudās
<div n="lb"/>Paijavana. Yāska<sup>15</sup> recognizes Viśvāmitra as the Purohita of
<div n="lb"/>Sudās; this accords with what seems to have been the fact
[Page2-276+ 63]
<div n="lb"/>that Viśvāmitra originally held the post. Probably, however,
<div n="lb"/>with the disappearance of Sudās, Viśvāmitra recovered his
<div n="lb"/>position, whereupon Vasiṣṭha in revenge for the murder of
<div n="lb"/>his sons secured in some way unspecified the defeat of the
<div n="lb"/>Saudāsas.<sup>16</sup>
<div n="P"/>At any rate it is hardly necessary to suppose that the enmity
<div n="lb"/>of the Saudāsas and Vasiṣṭhas was permanent. There is
<div n="lb"/>evidence<sup>17</sup> that the Bharatas had the Vasiṣṭhas as Purohitas,
<div n="lb"/>while other versions<sup>18</sup> regard them as Purohitas for people
<div n="lb"/>({%prajāḥ%}) generally. It seems that the Vasiṣṭhas were pioneers
<div n="lb"/>in adopting the rule that Purohitas should act as Brahman
<div n="lb"/>priest<sup>19</sup> at the sacrifice: the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>20</sup> states that
<div n="lb"/>the Vasiṣṭhas were once the only priests to act as Brahmans,
<div n="lb"/>but that later any priest could serve as such.<sup>21</sup> A rivalry
<div n="lb"/>with Jamadgni and Viśvāmitra is reported in the Taittirīya
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitā.<sup>22</sup> Parāśara and Śatayātu are associated with Vasiṣṭha
<div n="lb"/>in the Rigveda,<sup>23</sup> being apparently, as Geldner<sup>24</sup> thinks, the
<div n="lb"/>grandson and a son of Vasiṣṭha. According to Pischel,<sup>25</sup> in
<div n="lb"/>another hymn,<sup>26</sup> Vasiṣṭha appears as attempting to steal the
<div n="lb"/>goods of his father Varuṇa; Geldner<sup>27</sup> also shows that the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda<sup>28</sup> contains a clear reference to Vasiṣṭha's being a son
<div n="lb"/>of Varuṇa and the nymph Urvaśī. Perhaps this explains the
<div n="lb"/>fact that the Vasiṣṭhas are called the {@Tṛtsus@} in one passage
[Page2-277+ 52]
<div n="lb"/>of the Rigveda;<sup>29</sup> for being of miraculous parentage, Vasiṣṭha
<div n="lb"/>would need adoption into a Gotra, that of the princes whom
<div n="lb"/>he served, and to whom Agastya seems to have introduced
<div n="lb"/>him.
<div n="P"/>There are numerous other references to Vasiṣṭha as a Ṛṣi
<div n="lb"/>in Vedic literature,<sup>30</sup> in the Sūtras,<sup>31</sup> and in the Epic, where
<div n="lb"/>he and Viśvāmitra fight out their rivalry.<sup>32</sup>

{@Vāc,@}¦ ‘speech,’ plays a great part in Vedic speculation, but
<div n="lb"/>only a few points are of other than mythological significance.
<div n="lb"/>Speech is in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> divided into four kinds
<div n="lb"/>-that of men, of animals, of birds ({%vayāṃsi%}), and of small
<div n="lb"/>creeping things ({%kṣudraṃ sarīsṛpam%}). The discrimination or
<div n="lb"/>making articulate of speech is ascribed to Indra by the
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitās.<sup>2</sup> The ‘speech’ of the following musical instruments
<div n="lb"/>-{@Tūṇava, Vīṇā, Dundubhi@}<sup>3</sup> — is mentioned, and in one
<div n="lb"/>Saṃhitā<sup>4</sup> also that of the axle of a chariot. The speech of the
<div n="lb"/>{@Kuru-Pañcālas@} was especially renowned,<sup>5</sup> as well as that of the
<div n="lb"/>northern country, according to the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa,<sup>6</sup> so
<div n="lb"/>that men went there to study the language. On the other hand,
<div n="lb"/>barbarisms in speech were known, and were to be avoided.<sup>7</sup>
[Page2-280+ 55]
<div n="P"/>One division of speech referred to<sup>8</sup> is that of the divine
<div n="lb"/>({%daivī%}) and the human ({%mānuṣī%}), of which some specimens are
<div n="lb"/>given, such as {%om,%} the divine counterpart of {%tathā,%} and so forth.
<div n="lb"/>The Brahmin is said to know both;<sup>9</sup> it seems best to regard
<div n="lb"/>the distinction not as between Sanskrit and Apabhraṃśa, as
<div n="lb"/>Sāyaṇa<sup>10</sup> suggests, but as between the Sanskrit of the ritual
<div n="lb"/>and the hymns and that of ordinary life.
<div n="P"/>Reference is also made to Āryan<sup>11</sup> and to Brahmin<sup>12</sup> speech,
<div n="lb"/>by which Sanskrit, as opposed to non-Āryan tongues, seems to
<div n="lb"/>be meant. The {@Vrātyas@} are described as speaking the language
<div n="lb"/>of the initiated ({%dīkṣita-vāc%}), though not themselves initiated
<div n="lb"/>({%a-dīkṣita%}), but as calling that which is easy to utter ({%a-durukta%}),
<div n="lb"/>difficult to utter.<sup>13</sup> This may mean that the non-Brahminical
<div n="lb"/>Indians were advancing more rapidly than the Brahminical
<div n="lb"/>tribes to Prākrit speech, especially if it is legitimate to connect
<div n="lb"/>the Vrātyas with the barbarians in speech alluded to in the
<div n="lb"/>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>7</sup>

<div n="lb"/>The difficult phrase has caused some
<div n="lb"/>doubt as to the sense, for {%uttarāhi vāg%}
<div n="lb"/>{%vadati Kurupañcālatrā%} seems to mean
<div n="lb"/>‘speech in the north among the Kuru-
<div n="lb"/>Pañcālas,’ this version being slightly
<div n="lb"/>supported by the Kāṇva recension of
<div n="lb"/>the passage quoted by Eggeling, {%Sacred%}
<div n="lb"/>{%Books of the East,%} 12, xlii. n. 1. That
<div n="lb"/>recension, however, is not merely ob-
<div n="lb"/>scure, but it seems to couple the Kurus
<div n="lb"/>with the northern {@Mahāvṛṣas@} (so we
<div n="lb"/>must emend {%Mahāviṣeṣu%}), and it cannot
<div n="lb"/>be relied on. Eggeling's attempt to
<div n="lb"/>remove the difficulty by taking {%uttarāhi%}
<div n="lb"/>as ‘higher’ in tone is not satisfactory.
<div n="lb"/>The most probable solution is that of
<div n="lb"/>Weber, {%Indische Studien,%} 1, 191, who
<div n="lb"/>takes {%Kurupañcālatrā%} to be ‘as among

{@Vājapeya@}¦ is the name of a ceremony which, according to
<div n="lb"/>the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> and later authorities,<sup>2</sup> is only per-
<div n="lb"/>formed by a Brahmin or a Kṣatriya. The same Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup>
<div n="lb"/>insists that this sacrifice is superior to the {@Rājasūya,@} but the
<div n="lb"/>consensus of other authorities<sup>4</sup> assigns to it merely the place
<div n="lb"/>of a preliminary to the {@Bṛhaspatisava@} in the case of a priest,
<div n="lb"/>and to the {@Rājasūya@} in the case of a king, while the Śatapatha<sup>5</sup>
<div n="lb"/>is compelled to identify the Bṛhaspatisava with the Vājapeya.
<div n="lb"/>The essential ceremony is a chariot race in which the sacrificer
<div n="lb"/>is victorious. There is evidence in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta
<div n="lb"/>Sūtra<sup>6</sup> showing that once the festival was one which any
<div n="lb"/>Āryan could perform. Hillebrandt,<sup>7</sup> indeed, goes so far as to
<div n="lb"/>compare it with the Olympic games; but there is hardly much
<div n="lb"/>real ground for this: the rite seems to have been developed
<div n="lb"/>round a primitive habit of chariot racing, transformed into
<div n="lb"/>a ceremony which by sympathetic magic secures the success
<div n="lb"/>of the sacrificer. In fact<sup>8</sup> Eggeling seems correct in holding
<div n="lb"/>that the Vājapeya was a preliminary rite performed by a
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin prior to his formal installation as a Purohita, or by
<div n="lb"/>a king prior to his consecration. The Kuru Vājapeya was

{@Vāsas@}¦ is the most usual word in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later<sup>2</sup> for
<div n="lb"/>‘clothing.’ Clothes were often woven of sheep's wool ({%cf.%}
<div n="lb"/>{@Ūrṇā@}); the god Pūṣan is called a ‘weaver of garments’ ({%vāse-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%vāya%})<sup>3</sup> because of his connexion with the fashioning of forms.
<div n="lb"/>The garments worn were often embroidered ({%cf.%} {@Peśas@}), and
<div n="lb"/>the Maruts are described as wearing mantles adorned with
<div n="lb"/>gold.<sup>4</sup> When the ‘giver of garments’ ({%vāso-dā%})<sup>5</sup> is mentioned
<div n="lb"/>along with the giver of horses and gold, ornamental garments are
<div n="lb"/>probably meant. There are several references in the Rigveda<sup>6</sup>
<div n="lb"/>to the Indians' love of ornament, which is attested by Megas-
[Page2-292+ 53]
<div n="lb"/>thenes for his day.<sup>7</sup> The Rigveda also presents epithets like
<div n="lb"/>{%su-vasana%}<sup>8</sup> and {%su-rabhi,%}<sup>9</sup> implying that garments were becoming
<div n="lb"/>or well-fitting.
<div n="P"/>The Vedic Indian seems often to have worn three garments
<div n="lb"/>-an undergarment ({%cf.%} {@Nīvi@}),<sup>10</sup> a garment,<sup>11</sup> and an over-
<div n="lb"/>garment ({%cf.%} {@Adhīvāsa@}),<sup>12</sup> which was presumably a mantle, and
<div n="lb"/>for which the names {@Atka@} and {@Drāpi@} also seem to be used.
<div n="lb"/>This accords with the description of the sacrificial garments
<div n="lb"/>given in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>13</sup> which comprise a {@Tārpya,@}
<div n="lb"/>perhaps a ‘silken undergarment’; secondly, a garment of
<div n="lb"/>undyed wool, and then a mantle, while the ends of the turban,
<div n="lb"/>after being tied behind the neck, are brought forward and
<div n="lb"/>tucked away in front. The last point would hardly accord
<div n="lb"/>with the usual practice in ordinary life, but seems to be a
<div n="lb"/>special sacrificial ritual act. A similar sort of garments in the
<div n="lb"/>case of women appears to be alluded to in the Atharvaveda<sup>14</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>15</sup> There is nothing to show
<div n="lb"/>exactly what differences there were between male and female
<div n="lb"/>costume, nor what was exactly the nature of the clothes in
<div n="lb"/>either case.
<div n="P"/>It is important to note that the Vedic Indian evidently
<div n="lb"/>assumed that all civilized persons other than inspired Munis
<div n="lb"/>would wear clothing of some sort.<sup>16</sup>

{@Vidatha@}¦ is a word of obscure sense, confined mainly to the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda. According to Roth,<sup>1</sup> the sense is primarily ‘order,’
<div n="lb"/>then the concrete body which gives orders, then ‘assembly’ for
<div n="lb"/>secular<sup>2</sup> or religious ends,<sup>3</sup> or for war.<sup>4</sup> Oldenberg<sup>5</sup> once
<div n="lb"/>thought that the main idea is ‘ordinance’ (from {%vi-dhā,%}
<div n="lb"/>‘dispose,’ ‘ordain’), and thence ‘sacrifice.’ Ludwig<sup>6</sup> thinks
<div n="lb"/>that the root idea is an ‘assembly,’ especially of the {@Maghavans@}
<div n="lb"/>and the Brahmins. Geldner<sup>7</sup> considers that the word pri-
<div n="lb"/>marily means ‘knowledge,’ ‘wisdom,’ ‘priestly lore,’ then
<div n="lb"/>‘sacrifice’ and ‘spiritual authority.’ Bloomfield,<sup>8</sup> on the other
<div n="lb"/>hand, insists that Vidatha refers to the ‘house’<sup>9</sup> in the first
<div n="lb"/>place (from {%vid,%} ‘acquire’), and then to the ‘sacrifice,’ as
<div n="lb"/>connected with the house; this interpretation, at any rate,
<div n="lb"/>appears to suit all the passages. The term {%vidathya,%} once<sup>10</sup>
<div n="lb"/>applied to the king ({%samrāṭ%}), might seem to be against this
<div n="lb"/>view, but it may refer to his being ‘rich in homesteads’; and
<div n="lb"/>the connexion of the woman with the Vidatha, as opposed to
[Page2-297+ 43]
<div n="lb"/>the {@Sabhā,@} tells in favour<sup>11</sup> of Bloomfield's explanation. That

{@Videha@}¦ is the name of a people who are not mentioned
<div n="lb"/>before the Brāhmaṇa period. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup>
<div n="lb"/>the legend of {@Videgha Māthava@} preserves clearly a tradition
<div n="lb"/>that in Videha culture came from the Brahmins of the West,
<div n="lb"/>and that {@Kosala@} was brahminized before Videha. The Videhas,
<div n="lb"/>however, derived some fame later from the culture of their king
<div n="lb"/>{@Janaka,@} who figures in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad<sup>2</sup> as one of
<div n="lb"/>the leading patrons of the Brahman doctrine. In the Kauṣītaki
<div n="lb"/>Upaniṣad<sup>3</sup> the Videhas are joined with the {@Kāśis;@} in the list of
<div n="lb"/>peoples in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>4</sup> the Videhas are passed
<div n="lb"/>over, probably because, with Kosala and Kāśi, they are included
<div n="lb"/>in the term {@Prācyas,@} ‘easterners.’ Again, in the Śāṅkhāyana
<div n="lb"/>Śrauta Sūtra<sup>5</sup> it is recorded that the Kāśi, Kosala, and Videha
<div n="lb"/>kingdoms had each the one Purohita, {@Jala Jātūkarṇya;@} and
<div n="lb"/>in another passage of the same text<sup>6</sup> the connexion between
<div n="lb"/>the Videha king, {@Para Āṭṇāra,@} and the Kosala king, {@Hiraṇya-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@nābha,@} is explained, while the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>7</sup> speaks of
<div n="lb"/>Para Āṭṇāra as the Kosala king, descendant of Hiraṇyanābha.
<div n="P"/>Another king of Videha was {@Namī Sāpya,@} mentioned in the
<div n="lb"/>Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.<sup>8</sup> In the Saṃhitās of the Yajurveda<sup>9</sup>
<div n="lb"/>‘cows of Videha’ seem to be alluded to, though the com-
<div n="lb"/>mentator on the Taittirīya Saṃhitā merely takes the adjective
<div n="lb"/>{%vaidehī%} as ‘having a splendid body’ ({%viśiṣṭa-deha-sambandhinī%}),
<div n="lb"/>and the point of a place name in the expression is not very

{@Viś@}¦ is an expression of somewhat doubtful significance. In
<div n="lb"/>many passages of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> the sense of ‘settlement’ or
<div n="lb"/>‘dwelling’ is adequate and probable, since the root {%viś%} means
<div n="lb"/>to ‘enter’ or ‘settle.’ In other passages, where the Viśaḥ
[Page2-306+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>stand in relation to a prince, the term must mean ‘subject’;<sup>2</sup>
<div n="lb"/>so, for example, when the people of {@Tṛṇaskanda@}<sup>3</sup> or of the
<div n="lb"/>{@Tṛtsus@} are mentioned.<sup>4</sup> Again, in some passages<sup>5</sup> the general
<div n="lb"/>sense of ‘people’ is adequate; as when the Rigveda speaks of
<div n="lb"/>the ‘Āryan people,’<sup>6</sup> or the ‘divine people,’<sup>7</sup> or the ‘Dāsa
<div n="lb"/>people,’ and so on.<sup>8</sup>
<div n="P"/>Sometimes,<sup>9</sup> however, the Viś appear in a more special sense
<div n="lb"/>as a subdivision of the {@Jana@} or whole people. This is, how-
<div n="lb"/>ever, not common, for in most passages one or other of the
<div n="lb"/>senses given above is quite possible. Moreover, it is very
<div n="lb"/>difficult to decide whether the Viś as a subdivision of the Jana
<div n="lb"/>is to be considered as being a local subdivision (canton) or a
<div n="lb"/>blood kinship equivalent to a clan in the large sense of the
<div n="lb"/>word, while the relation of the Viś to the {@Grāma@} or to the
<div n="lb"/>{@Gotra@} is quite uncertain. In one passage of the Atharvaveda<sup>10</sup>
<div n="lb"/>the Viśaḥ are mentioned along with the {%sabandhavaḥ%} or relatives,
<div n="lb"/>but no definite conclusion can be drawn from that fact. Nor
<div n="lb"/>does the analogy of the Roman {%curia%} or the Greek <lang n="greek"></lang> throw
<div n="lb"/>much light, as these institutions are themselves of obscure
<div n="lb"/>character, and the parallelism need not be cogent. It is, at
<div n="lb"/>any rate, possible that the Viś may in some cases have been no
<div n="lb"/>more than a Gotra or clan, or different clans may sometimes
[Page2-307+ 72]
<div n="lb"/>have made up a Viś, while Grāma is more definitely, perhaps, a
<div n="lb"/>local designation. But the Vedic evidence is quite inconclusive.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="lb"/>{%Cf.%} {@Viśpati.@}
<div n="P"/>In the later period the sense of Viś is definitely restricted in
<div n="lb"/>some cases<sup>12</sup> to denote the third of the classes of the Vedic
<div n="lb"/>polity, the people or clansmen as opposed to the nobles ({@Kṣatra,@}

<div n="lb"/>that there is no passage requiring this sense, the only one
<div n="lb"/>quoted by him<sup>2</sup> being certainly indecisive. In the great

<div n="lb"/>order to allow her lover to approach her, for the household may
<div n="lb"/>well be deemed to have been a joint family, in which the
<div n="lb"/>Viśpati could easily be different from the father of the

<div n="lb"/>Viśpati is the king as ‘lord of the subject-people’ ({%viśām%}),
<div n="lb"/>though here Zimmer<sup>7</sup> thinks reference is made to the election

<div n="lb"/>mentioned in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> and to whom the third Maṇḍala is
<div n="lb"/>attributed by tradition. In one hymn<sup>2</sup> which appears to be his
<div n="lb"/>own composition, he praises the rivers {@Vipāś@} (Beas) and
<div n="lb"/>{@Śutudrī@} (Sutlej). There he calls himself the son of {@Kuśika,@}
<div n="lb"/>and seems unquestionably to be the helper of the {@Bharatas,@}
<div n="lb"/>whom he mentions. The tribe, engaged in a raid, apparently
<div n="lb"/>came to the rivers from the east.<sup>4</sup> Anxious to cross them, they
<div n="P"/>^3 Rv. iii. 33, 5.
[Page2-311+ 57]
<div n="lb"/>found them in high flood, but Viśvāmitra by prayer induced
<div n="lb"/>the waters to subside. The same feat appears to be referred
<div n="lb"/>to in another passage of the same book of the Rigveda.<sup>5</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Curiously enough, Sāyaṇa<sup>6</sup> quite misunderstands the situation:
<div n="lb"/>according to him, Viśvāmitra having obtained wealth by the
<div n="lb"/>exercise of his office, went off with it to the rivers, pur-
<div n="lb"/>sued by others. Yāska's<sup>7</sup> version of the tale merely seems
<div n="lb"/>to mean that the king paid Viśvāmitra to act as his {@Puro-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@hita,@} or domestic priest. For the relations of Viśvāmitra
<div n="lb"/>to Vasiṣṭha connected with their service of {@Sudās, see@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Vasiṣṭha.@}
<div n="P"/>The Viśvāmitras are mentioned in several other passages of
<div n="lb"/>the Rigveda,<sup>8</sup> and are also designated as a family by the term
<div n="lb"/>{@Kuśikas.@}<sup>9</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the later literature Viśvāmitra becomes, like Vasiṣṭha, a
<div n="lb"/>mythical sage, usually<sup>10</sup> mentioned in connection with {@Jamad-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@agni;@} he was Hotṛ priest at the sacrifice of {@Śunaḥśepa,@} whom
<div n="lb"/>he adopted, and to whom he gave the name of {@Devarāta.@}<sup>11</sup> He
<div n="lb"/>was a protégé of Indra, with whom he had an interview
<div n="lb"/>according to the Rigveda Āraṇyakas.<sup>12</sup> He is also often
<div n="lb"/>mentioned as a Ṛṣi.<sup>13</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Epic<sup>14</sup> Viśvāmitra is represented as a king, who
<div n="lb"/>becomes a Brahmin. There is no trace of his kingship in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda, but the Nirukta<sup>15</sup> calls his father, Kuśika, a king; the
[Page2-312+ 52]
<div n="lb"/>Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>16</sup> refers to Śunaḥśepa as succeeding to
<div n="lb"/>the lordship of the {@Jahnus,@} as well as the ‘divine lore’ ({%daiva%}
<div n="lb"/>{%veda%}) of the {@Gāthins;@} and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>17</sup>
<div n="lb"/>mentions Viśvāmitra as a king. But there is no real-trace of
<div n="lb"/>this kingship of Viśvāmitra: it may probably be dismissed as a
<div n="lb"/>mere legend, with no more foundation at most than that Viśvā-
<div n="lb"/>mitra was of a family which once had been royal. But even
<div n="lb"/>this is doubtful.

{@Vaira@}¦<sup>1</sup> and {@Vaira-deya@}<sup>2</sup> seem to have in the later Saṃhitās
<div n="lb"/>and the Brāhmaṇas the definite and technical sense of ‘wergeld,’
<div n="lb"/>the money to be paid for killing a man as a compensation to
<div n="lb"/>his relatives. This view is borne out by the Sūtras of Āpa-
<div n="lb"/>stamba<sup>3</sup> and Baudhāyana.<sup>4</sup> Both prescribe the scale of
<div n="lb"/>1,000 cows for a {@Kṣatriya,@}<sup>5</sup> 100 for a {@Vaiśya,@} 10 for a {@Śūdra,@}
<div n="lb"/>and a bull over and above in each case. Āpastamba leaves the
<div n="lb"/>destination of the payment vague, but Baudhāyana assigns it
<div n="lb"/>to the king. It is reasonable to suppose that the cows were
<div n="lb"/>intended for the relations, and the bull was a present to the
<div n="lb"/>king for his intervention to induce the injured relatives to
<div n="lb"/>abandon the demand for the life of the offender. The Āpa-
<div n="lb"/>stamba Sūtra<sup>6</sup> allows the same scale of wergeld for women, but
<div n="lb"/>the Gautama Sūtra<sup>7</sup> puts them on a level with men of the
<div n="lb"/>Śūdra caste only, except in one special case. The payment is
<div n="lb"/>made for the purpose of {%vaira-yātana%} or {%vaira-niryātana,%} ‘requital
<div n="lb"/>of enmity,’ ‘expiation.’
<div n="P"/>The Rigveda<sup>8</sup> preserves, also, the important notice that a
<div n="lb"/>man's wergeld was a hundred (cows), for it contains the epithet
<div n="lb"/>{%śata-dāya,%} ‘one whose wergeld is a hundred.’ No doubt the
<div n="lb"/>values varied, but in the case of {@Śunaḥśepa@} the amount is a
<div n="lb"/>hundred (cows) in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>9</sup> In the Yajurveda

{@Vaiśya@}¦ denotes a man, not so much of the people, as of the
<div n="lb"/>subject class, distinct from the ruling noble ({@Kṣatriya@}) and the
<div n="lb"/>{@Brāhmaṇa,@} the higher strata of the Āryan community on the
<div n="lb"/>one side, and from the aboriginal {@Śūdra@} on the other. The
<div n="lb"/>name is first found in the Puruṣa-sūkta (‘hymn of man’) in
<div n="lb"/>the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> and then frequently from the Atharvaveda<sup>2</sup>
<div n="lb"/>onwards,<sup>3</sup> sometimes in the form of Viśya.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Vaiśya plays singularly little part in Vedic literature,
<div n="lb"/>which has much to say of Kṣatriya and Brahmin. His
<div n="lb"/>characteristics are admirably summed up in the Aitareya Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa<sup>5</sup> in the adjectives {%anyasya bali-kṛt,%} ‘tributary to another’;
<div n="lb"/>{%anyasyādya,%} ‘to be lived upon by another’; and {%yathākāma-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%jyeyaḥ,%} ‘to be oppressed at will.’ He was unquestionably taxed
<div n="lb"/>by the king ({@Rājan@}), who no doubt assigned to his retinue the
<div n="lb"/>right of support by the people, so that the Kṣatriyas grew more
<div n="lb"/>and more to depend on the services rendered to them by the
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśyas. But the Vaiśya was not a slave: he could not be
<div n="lb"/>killed by the king or anyone else without the slayer incurring
<div n="lb"/>risk and the payment of a wergeld ({@Vaira@}), which even in the
<div n="lb"/>Brahmin books extends to 100 cows for a Vaiśya. Moreover,
<div n="lb"/>though the Vaiśya could be expelled by the king at pleasure, he
<div n="lb"/>cannot be said to have been without property in his land.
<div n="lb"/>Hopkins<sup>6</sup> thinks it is absurd to suppose that he could really be
<div n="lb"/>a landowner when he was subject to removal at will, but this
<div n="lb"/>is to ignore the fact that normally the king could not remove
<div n="lb"/>the landowner, and that kings were ultimately dependent on
<div n="lb"/>the people, as the tales of exiled kings show.
<div n="P"/>On the other hand, Hopkins<sup>7</sup> is clearly right in holding that
<div n="lb"/>the Vaiśya was really an agriculturist, and that Vedic society
<div n="lb"/>was not merely a landholding aristocracy, superimposed upon
<div n="lb"/>an agricultural aboriginal stock, as Baden Powell<sup>8</sup> urged.
<div n="lb"/>Without ignoring the possibility that the Dravidians were
<div n="lb"/>agriculturists, there is no reason to deny that the Āryans were
[Page2-334+ 44]
<div n="lb"/>so likewise, and the goad of the plougher was the mark of a
<div n="lb"/>Vaiśya in life<sup>9</sup> and in death.<sup>10</sup> It would be absurd to suppose
<div n="lb"/>that the Āryan Vaiśyas did not engage in industry and com-
<div n="lb"/>merce ({%cf.%} {@Paṇi, Vaṇij@}), but pastoral pursuits and agriculture
<div n="lb"/>must have been their normal occupations.
<div n="P"/>In war the Vaiśyas must have formed the bulk of the force
<div n="lb"/>under the Kṣatriya leaders (see {@Kṣatriya@}). But like the
<div n="lb"/>Homeric commoners, the Vaiśyas may well have done little of
<div n="lb"/>the serious fighting, being probably ill-provided with either
<div n="lb"/>body armour or offensive weapons.
<div n="P"/>That the Vaiśyas were engaged in the intellectual life of the
<div n="lb"/>day is unlikely; nor is there any tradition, corresponding to
<div n="lb"/>that regarding the Kṣatriyas, of their having taken part in the
<div n="lb"/>evolution of the doctrine of Brahman, the great philosophic
<div n="lb"/>achievement of the age. The aim of the Vaiśya's ambition
<div n="lb"/>was, according to the Taittirīya Saṃhitā,<sup>11</sup> to become a
<div n="lb"/>{@Grāmaṇī,@} or village headman, a post probably conferred by the
<div n="lb"/>king on wealthy Vaiśyas, of whom no doubt there were many.
<div n="lb"/>It is impossible to say if in Vedic times a Vaiśya could attain to
<div n="lb"/>nobility or become a Brahmin. No instance can safely be
<div n="lb"/>quoted in support of such a view,<sup>12</sup> though such changes of
<div n="lb"/>status may have taken place (see {@Kṣatriya@} and {@Varṇa@}).
<div n="P"/>It is denied by Fick<sup>13</sup> that the Vaiśyas were ever a caste, and
<div n="lb"/>the denial is certainly based on good grounds if it is held that
<div n="lb"/>a caste means a body within which marriage is essential, and
<div n="lb"/>which follows a hereditary occupation ({%cf.%} {@Varṇa@}). But it
<div n="lb"/>would be wrong<sup>14</sup> to suppose that the term Vaiśya was merely
<div n="lb"/>applied by theorists to the people who were not nobles or
<div n="lb"/>priests. It must have been an early appellation of a definite
<div n="lb"/>class which was separate from the other classes, and properly
<div n="lb"/>to be compared with them. Moreover, though there were
<div n="lb"/>differences among Vaiśyas, there were equally differences
<div n="lb"/>among Kṣatriyas and Brāhmanas, and it is impossible to deny
[Page2-335+ 41]
<div n="lb"/>the Vaiśyas' claim to be reckoned a class or caste it the other
<div n="lb"/>two are such, though at the present day things are different.

{@Vrātya@}¦ is included in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha
<div n="lb"/>(‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda,<sup>1</sup> where, however, no
<div n="lb"/>further explanation of the name is given. Fuller information
<div n="lb"/>is furnished by the Atharvaveda,<sup>2</sup> the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>3</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and the Sūtras.<sup>4</sup> which describe at length a certain rite intended
<div n="lb"/>for the use of Vrātyas. According to the Pañcaviṃśa Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa, there are four different kinds of ‘outcasts’ — viz., the
<div n="lb"/>{%hīna,%} who are merely described as ‘depressed’; those who have
<div n="lb"/>become outcasts for some sin ({%nindita%}); those who become out-
<div n="lb"/>casts at an early age, apparently by living among outcasts; and
<div n="lb"/>those old men who, being impotent ({%śama-nīcameḍhra%}), have
<div n="lb"/>gone to live with outcasts. The last three categories are by no
<div n="lb"/>means of the same importance as the first. The motive of
<div n="lb"/>the fourth is hard to understand: according to Rājārām Rām-
[Page2-343+ 41]
<div n="lb"/>krishṇa Bhāgavat,<sup>5</sup> they were men who had enfeebled their
<div n="lb"/>constitutions by undue intercourse with women in the lands of
<div n="lb"/>the outcasts, and returned home in a debilitated state. But
<div n="lb"/>this is not stated in the text.
<div n="P"/>It seems probable that the really important Vrātyas were
<div n="lb"/>those referred to as {%hīna,%} and that the other classes were only
<div n="lb"/>subsidiary. According to Rājārām,<sup>6</sup> there were two categories
<div n="lb"/>of the first class: ({%a%}) The depressed ({%hīna%}), who were non-
<div n="lb"/>Āryan; and ({%b%}) degraded Āryans ({%gara-gir%}). This, however, is
<div n="lb"/>a mere guess, and devoid of probability. There seems to have
<div n="lb"/>been but one class of Vrātyas. That they were non-Āryan is
<div n="lb"/>not probable, for it is expressly said<sup>7</sup> that, though unconse-
<div n="lb"/>crated, they spoke the tongue of the consecrated: they were
<div n="lb"/>thus apparently Āryans. This view is confirmed by the state-
<div n="lb"/>ment that ‘they call what is easy of utterance, difficult to
<div n="lb"/>utter’: probable they and already a somewhat Prakritic form of
<div n="lb"/>speech ({%cf.%} {@Vāc@}). The Sūtras mention their Arhants (‘saints’)
<div n="lb"/>and Yaudhas (‘warrioes’), corresponding to the Brahminical
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa and Kṣatriya.
<div n="P"/>Other particulars accord with the view that they were
<div n="lb"/>Āryans outside the sphere of Brahmin culture. Thus they
<div n="lb"/>are said<sup>8</sup> not to practise agriculture or commerce (an
<div n="lb"/>allusion to a nomadic life), not to observe the rules of
<div n="lb"/>{@Brahmacarya@} — {%i.e.,%} the principle regulating the Brahminic
<div n="lb"/>order of life. They were also allowed to become members
<div n="lb"/>of the Brahminical community by performance of the ritual
<div n="lb"/>prescribed, which would hardly be so natural in the case
<div n="lb"/>of non-Āryans.
<div n="P"/>Some details are given of the life and dress of the Vrātyas.
<div n="lb"/>Their principles were opposed to those of the Brahmins: they
<div n="lb"/>beat those unworthy of correction.<sup>9</sup> Their leder (Gṛhapati) or
<div n="lb"/>householder wore a turban ({@Uṣṇīṣa@}), carried a whip ({@Pratoda@}),
<div n="lb"/>a kind of bow ({@Jyāhroḍa@}), was clothed in a black ({%kṛṣṇaśa%})
<div n="lb"/>garment and two skins ({@Ajina@}), black and white ({%kṛṣṇa-valakṣa%}),
<div n="lb"/>and owned a rough wagon ({@Vipatha@}) covered with planks
[Page2-344+ 51]
<div n="lb"/>({%phalakāstīrṇa%}). The others,<sup>10</sup> subordinate to the leader, had
<div n="lb"/>garments with fringes of red ({%valūkāntāni dāmatūṣāṇi%}), two
<div n="lb"/>fringes on each, skins folded double ({%dviṣaṃhitāny ajināni%}), and
<div n="lb"/>sandals ({@Upānah@}). The leader wore also an ornament ({@Niṣka@})
<div n="lb"/>of silver, which Rājārām<sup>11</sup> converts into a silver coinage. The
<div n="lb"/>Vrātyas, on becoming consecrated, were expected to hand over
<div n="lb"/>their goods to the priest. Many other details are given in the
<div n="lb"/>Sūtras ({%e.g.,%} that the shoes or sandals were of variegated black
<div n="lb"/>hue and pointed), but these are not authenticated by the
<div n="lb"/>Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
<div n="P"/>The locality in which the Vrātyas lived cannot be stated with
<div n="lb"/>certainty, but their nomad life<sup>12</sup> suggests the western tribes
<div n="lb"/>beyond the Sarasvatī. But they may equally well have been in
<div n="lb"/>the east: this possibility is so far supported by the fact that the
<div n="lb"/>Sūtras make the Brahmin receiving the gift of the Vrātya's
<div n="lb"/>outfit an inhabitant of {@Magadha.@} The Atharvaveda<sup>13</sup> does not
<div n="lb"/>help, for it treats the Vrātya in so mystical a way that he is
<div n="lb"/>represented as being in all the quarters. Indeed, Roth<sup>14</sup>
<div n="lb"/>believed that it was here not a case of the Vrātya of the Pañca-
<div n="lb"/>viṃśa Brāhmaṇa at all, but of a glorification of the Vrātya as
<div n="lb"/>the type of the pious vagrant or wandering religious mendicant
<div n="lb"/>({@Parivrājaka@}). This view is clearly wrong, as the occurrence
<div n="lb"/>of the words {%uṣṇīsa, vipatha,%} and {%pratoaa%} shows. It is probable
<div n="lb"/>that the 15th Book of the Atharvaveda, which deals with the
<div n="lb"/>Vrātya, and is of a mystical character, exalts the converted
<div n="lb"/>Vrātya as a type of the perfect {@Brahmicārin,@} and, in so far, of
<div n="lb"/>the divinity.<sup>15</sup>

{@Śambara@}¦ is the name of an enemy of Indra in the Rigveda.<sup>1</sup>
<div n="lb"/>He is mentioned along with {@Śuṣṇa, Pipru,@} and {@Varcin,@} being
<div n="lb"/>in one passage called a {@Dāsa,@} son of Kulitara.<sup>2</sup> In another
<div n="lb"/>passage<sup>3</sup> he is said to have deemed himself a godling ({%devaka%}).
<div n="lb"/>His forts, ninety,<sup>4</sup> ninety-nine,<sup>5</sup> or a hundred<sup>6</sup> in number, are
<div n="lb"/>alluded to, the word itself in the neuter plural once<sup>7</sup> meaning
<div n="lb"/>the ‘forts of Śambara.’ His great foe was {@Divodāsa Ati-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@thigva,@} who won victories over him by Indra's aid.<sup>8</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is impossible to say with certainty whether Śambara was
<div n="lb"/>a real person or not. Hillebrandt<sup>9</sup> is strongly in favour of the
<div n="lb"/>theory that he was a real chief as enemy of Divodāsa: he
<div n="lb"/>relies on the statistics<sup>10</sup> of the mention of the name to show
<div n="lb"/>that, where as he was conceived as a real foe in the hymns of
<div n="lb"/>the time of Divodāsa, later texts, like those of the seventh
<div n="lb"/>Maṇḍala, make him into a demon, as a result of the change of
<div n="lb"/>scene from Arachosia to India. As a matter of fact, apart from
<div n="lb"/>this theory, Śambara was quite possibly an aboriginal enemy
<div n="lb"/>in India, living in the mountains.<sup>11</sup>

{@Śarīra,@}¦ ‘body,’ is a word of frequent occurrence in Vedic
<div n="lb"/>literature.<sup>1</sup> The interest of the Vedic Indians seems early to
<div n="lb"/>have been attracted to the consideration of questions connected
<div n="lb"/>with the anatomy of the body. Thus a hymn of the Atharva-
<div n="lb"/>veda<sup>2</sup> enumerates many parts of the body with some approach
<div n="lb"/>to accuracy and orderly arrangement.<sup>3</sup> It mentions the heels
<div n="lb"/>({%pārṣṇī%}), the flesh ({%māṃsa%}), the ankle-bones ({%gulphau%}), the
<div n="lb"/>fingers ({%aṅgulīḥ%}), the apertures ({%kha%}), the two metatarsi
<div n="lb"/>({%uchlakau%}), the tarsus ({%pratiṣṭhā%}), the two knee-caps ({%aṣṭhī-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%vantau%}), the two legs ({%jaṅghe%}), the two knee-joints ({%jānunoḥ%}
<div n="lb"/>{%sandhī%}). Then comes above the two kness ({%jānū%}) the four-
<div n="lb"/>sided ({%catuṣṭaya%}), pliant ({%śithira%}) trunk ({%kabandha%}). The two
<div n="lb"/>hips ({%śroṇī%}) and the two thighs ({%ārū%}) are the props of the frame
[Page2-359+ 61]
<div n="lb"/>({%kusindha%}). Next come the breast-bone ({%uras%}), the cervical
<div n="lb"/>cartilages ({%grīvāḥ%}), the two breast pieces ({%stanau%}), the two
<div n="lb"/>shoulder-blades ({%kaphoḍau%}), the neck-bones ({%skandhau%}), and the
<div n="lb"/>backbones ({%pṛṣṭīḥ%}), the collar-bones ({%aṃsau%}), the arms ({%bāhū%}),
<div n="lb"/>the seven apertures in the head ({%sapta khāni śīrṣaṇi%}), the ears
<div n="lb"/>({%karṇau%}), the nostrils ({%nāsike%}), the eyes ({%cakṣaṇī%}), the mouth
<div n="lb"/>({%mukha%}), the jaws ({%hanū%}), the tongue ({%jihvā%}), the brain ({%mas-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%tiṣka%}), the forehead ({%lalāṭa%}), the facial bone ({%kakāṭikā%}), the
<div n="lb"/>cranium ({%kapāla%}), and the structure of the jaws ({%cityā hanvoḥ%}).
<div n="P"/>This system presents marked similarities with the later
<div n="lb"/>system of Caraka and Suśruta,<sup>4</sup> which render certain the names
<div n="lb"/>ascribed to the several terms by Hoernle. {%Kaphoḍau,%} which is
<div n="lb"/>variously read in the manuscripts,<sup>5</sup> is rendered ‘collar-bone’ by
<div n="lb"/>Whitney, but ‘elbow’ in the St. Petersburg Dictionary.
<div n="lb"/>{%Skandha%} in the plural regularly<sup>6</sup> denotes ‘neck-bones,’ or, more
<div n="lb"/>precisely, ‘cervical vertebræ,’ a part denoted also by {%uṣṇihā%} in
<div n="lb"/>the plural.<sup>7</sup> {%Pṛṣṭī%}<sup>8</sup> denotes not ‘rib,’ which is {%parśu,%}<sup>9</sup> but a
<div n="lb"/>transverse process of a vertebra, and so the vertebra itself,
<div n="lb"/>there being in the truncal portion of the spinal column seventeen
<div n="lb"/>vertebræ and thirty-four transverse processes. The vertebræ
<div n="lb"/>are also denoted by {%kīkasā%} in the plural,<sup>10</sup> which sometimes<sup>11</sup> is
<div n="lb"/>limited to the upper portion of the vertebral column, sometimes<sup>12</sup>
<div n="lb"/>to the thoracic portion of the spine. {%Anūka%} also denotes the
<div n="lb"/>vertebral column,<sup>13</sup> or more specially the lumbar<sup>14</sup> or thoracic<sup>15</sup>
<div n="lb"/>portion of the spine; it is said in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>15</sup>
[Page2-360+ 55]
<div n="lb"/>that there are twenty transverse processes in the lumbar spine
<div n="lb"/>({%udara%}) and thirty-two in the thoracic, which gives twenty-six
<div n="lb"/>vertebræ, the true number (but the modern division is seven
<div n="lb"/>cervical, twelve thoracic, five lumbar, and two false — the
<div n="lb"/>sacrum and the coccyx). The vertebral column is also denoted
<div n="lb"/>by {%karūkara,%}<sup>16</sup> which, however, is usually found in the plural<sup>17</sup>
<div n="lb"/>denoting the transverse processes of the vertebræ, a sense
<div n="lb"/>expressed also by {%kuntāpa.%}<sup>18</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%Grīvā,%} in the plural, denotes cervical vertebræ, the number
<div n="lb"/>seven being given by the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>19</sup> but usually<sup>20</sup>
<div n="lb"/>the word simply means windpipe, or, more accurately, the
<div n="lb"/>cartilaginous rings under the skin. {@Jatru,@} also in the plural,
<div n="lb"/>denotes the cervical cartilages,<sup>21</sup> or possibly the costal carti-
<div n="lb"/>lages, which are certainly so called in the Śatapatha Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa,<sup>22</sup> where their number is given as eight.
<div n="P"/>{%Bhaṃsas,%} which occurs thrice in the Atharvaveda,<sup>23</sup> seems to
<div n="lb"/>denote the pubic bone or arch rather than the ‘buttocks’ or
<div n="lb"/>‘fundament,’ as Whitney<sup>24</sup> takes it.
<div n="P"/>In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>25</sup> the number of bones in the
<div n="lb"/>the human body is given as 360. The number of the bones
<div n="lb"/>of the head and trunk are given in another passage<sup>26</sup> as
<div n="lb"/>follows: The head is threefold, consisting of skin ({%tvac%}), bone
<div n="lb"/>({%asthi%}), brain ({%matiṣka%}); the neck has 15 bones: 14 transverse
<div n="lb"/>processes ({%karūkara%}) and the strength ({%vīrya%}) — {%i.e.,%} the bone of
<div n="lb"/>the centre regarded as one — as the 15th; the breast has 17:
<div n="lb"/>16 cervical cartilages ({%jatru%}), and the sternum ({%uras%}) as the
<div n="lb"/>17th; the abdominal portion of the spine has 21: 20 trans-
[Page2-361+ 45]
<div n="lb"/>verse processes ({%kuntāpa%}), and the abdominal portion ({%udara%}) as
<div n="lb"/>the 21st; the two sides have 27: 26 ribs ({%parśu%}), and the two
<div n="lb"/>sides as the 27th; the thoracic portion of the spine ({%anūka%})
<div n="lb"/>has 33: 32 transverse processes, and the thoracic portion
<div n="lb"/>as 33rd.
<div n="P"/>There are several enumerations of the parts of the body, not
<div n="lb"/>merely of the skeleton, in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās.<sup>27</sup> They
<div n="lb"/>include the hair ({%lomāni%}), skin ({%tvac%}), flesh ({%māṃsa%}), bone

<div n="lb"/>Śaryaṇāvant being a lake not far from it in the back part
<div n="lb"/>({%jaghanārdhe%}) of Kurukṣetra. The unusual consistency of his
<div n="lb"/>statements on this point is in favour of the word being a place
<div n="lb"/>name; it is also to be noted that Kurukṣetra contained the
<div n="lb"/>lake {@Anyataḥplakṣā.@} Roth,<sup>2</sup> however, thought that in two
<div n="lb"/>passages<sup>3</sup> the word denoted merely a ‘lake,’ literally ‘(water)
<div n="lb"/>covered with a thicket of reeds’ ({%śaryaṇa%}), and in the others a
<div n="lb"/>Soma vessel. Zimmer<sup>4</sup> inclines to this rendering. On the
<div n="lb"/>other hand, Pischel<sup>5</sup> accepts Sāyaṇa's view. Hillebrandt<sup>6</sup> also
<div n="lb"/>sees in the word a place name, but he is inclined to locate it
<div n="lb"/>among the ‘five tribes,’<sup>7</sup> which is not quite inconsistent with its
<div n="lb"/>being in Kurukṣetra, for the connexion of the {@Pūrus@} with the
<div n="lb"/>later {@Kurus@} is known;<sup>8</sup> or perhaps, he suggests, Śaryaṇāvant
<div n="lb"/>is an old name for the Wular sea of Kaśmīr, which was only a
<div n="lb"/>reminiscence in Vedic times. This is not probable; still less
<div n="lb"/>so is Ludwig's hypothesis<sup>9</sup> that the Śaryaṇāvant is the later
<div n="lb"/>eastern {@Sarasvatī.@} Bergaigne<sup>10</sup> regards the name as that of

<L>3323<pc>2-388<k1>SUdra<k2>SUdra
{@Śūdra@}¦ is the designation of the fourth caste in the Vedic
<div n="lb"/>state (see {@Varṇa@}). It is quite unknown in the Rigveda except
<div n="lb"/>in the Puruṣasūkta<sup>1</sup> (‘hymn of man’) in the tenth Maṇḍla,
<div n="lb"/>where is the earliest version of the origin of the castes the
<div n="lb"/>Śudra for the first time appears. The Rigveda, on the other
<div n="lb"/>hand, knows {@Dasyu@} and {@Dāsa,@} both as aborigines independent
<div n="lb"/>of Āryan control and as subjugated slaves: it is reasonable to
<div n="lb"/>reckon the Śūdra of the later texts as belonging to the
<div n="lb"/>aborigines who had been reduced to subjection by the Āryans.
<div n="lb"/>Strictly speaking, the defeated aborigines must have been
<div n="lb"/>regarded as slaves, but it is obvious that, except on occasions
<div n="lb"/>when most of the men were slain, which may have occurred
<div n="lb"/>quite often, there must have remained too many of them to be
<div n="lb"/>used as slaves of individual owners. The villages of the
<div n="lb"/>aborigines must have continued to subsist, but under Āryan
<div n="lb"/>lordship and control: there may be this amount of truth in
<div n="lb"/>Baden Powell's theory, which practically traced all the early
<div n="lb"/>cultivating villages in India to Dravidian origin. On the other
<div n="lb"/>hand, the term Śūdra would also cover the wild hill tribes
<div n="lb"/>which lived by hunting and fishing, and many of which would
<div n="lb"/>acknowledge the superiority of their Āryan neighbours: it
<div n="lb"/>could, in fact, be applied to all beyond the pale of the Āryan
<div n="lb"/>state.
<div n="P"/>This view of the Śūdra suits adequately the Vedic references
<div n="lb"/>to his condition, which would not apply adequately to domestic
<div n="lb"/>slaves only. The Śūdra is continually opposed to the Āryan,<sup>2</sup>
<div n="lb"/>and the colour of the Śūdra is compared with that of the
<div n="lb"/>Āryan,<sup>3</sup> just as his ways are so contrasted.<sup>4</sup> The Aitareya
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa,<sup>5</sup> in its account of the castes, declares that the
[Page2-389+ 53]
<div n="lb"/>Śūdra is {%anyasya preṣya,%} ‘the servant of another’; {%kāmotthāpya,%}
<div n="lb"/>‘to be expelled at will’; and {%yathākāmavadhya,%} ‘to be slain at
<div n="lb"/>will.’ All these terms well enough describe the position of the
<div n="lb"/>serf as the result of a conquest: the epithets might have been
<div n="lb"/>applied to the English serf after the Norman Conquest with
<div n="lb"/>but slight inaccuracy, especially if his master had received a
<div n="lb"/>grant of jurisdiction from the Crown. The Pañcaviṃśa Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa<sup>6</sup> explains that even if prosperous ({%bahu-paśu,%} ‘having
<div n="lb"/>many cows’) a Śūdra could not be other than a servant: his
<div n="lb"/>business was {%pādāvanejya,%} ‘the washing of the feet’ of his
<div n="lb"/>superiors. The Mahābhārata<sup>7</sup> says out and out that a Śūdra
<div n="lb"/>has no property ({%na hi svam asti śūdrasya,%} ‘the Śūdra has
<div n="lb"/>nothing he can call his own’). On the other hand, just as in
<div n="lb"/>England the royal justice would protect the serf in life and
<div n="lb"/>limb,<sup>8</sup> so it appears that the slaying of a Śūdra involved a
<div n="lb"/>wergeld of ten cows according to both Baudhāyana<sup>9</sup> and
<div n="lb"/>Āpastamba.<sup>10</sup> It may, indeed, be held that this wergeld was
<div n="lb"/>only due in case of murder by another than the master, but
<div n="lb"/>such limitation is nowhere stated.
<div n="P"/>In sacred matters the distinction between Āryan and {@Śūdra@}
<div n="lb"/>was, of course, specially marked. The texts<sup>11</sup> do not hesitate
<div n="lb"/>to declare that the upper castes were ‘all,’ ignoring the Śūdras;
<div n="lb"/>the Śūdra is prohibited<sup>12</sup> from milking the cow for the milk
<div n="lb"/>required at the Agnihotra (‘oblation to Agni’); and the Śata-
<div n="lb"/>patha Brāhmaṇa<sup>13</sup> forbids a man who has been consecrated
<div n="lb"/>({%dīkṣita%}) for a sacrifice to speak to a Śūdra at all for the time,
<div n="lb"/>though the Śāṭyāyanaka<sup>14</sup> seems to have relaxed this rule by
<div n="lb"/>confining it to cases in which the Śūdra was guilty of some sin.
[Page2-390+ 62]
<div n="lb"/>At the sacrifice itself the Śūdra could not be present in the
<div n="lb"/>{%śālā,%} ‘hall’; he is definitely classed in the Śatapatha Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>máṇa<sup>15</sup> and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>16</sup> as unfit for ‘sacrifice’
<div n="lb"/>({%ayajñiya%}); and declared in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>17</sup> not to be
<div n="lb"/>admitted to drink Soma. At the Pravargya (introductory
<div n="lb"/>Soma) rite the performer is not allowed to come in contact
<div n="lb"/>with a Śūdra,<sup>18</sup> who here, as in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā,<sup>17</sup> is
<div n="lb"/>reckoned as excluded from a share in the Soma-draught. On
<div n="lb"/>the other hand, the Śūdra is one of the victims at the Puruṣa-
<div n="lb"/>medha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda,<sup>19</sup> and a fight
<div n="lb"/>between an Āryan and a Śūdra, in which, of course, the former
<div n="lb"/>wins, forms a part of the Mahāvrata rite, being perhaps a pre-
<div n="lb"/>cursor of the Indian drama.<sup>20</sup>
<div n="P"/>Other indications, however, exist, showing that it would be
<div n="lb"/>undesirable to ignore the real importance of the Śūdra, which
<div n="lb"/>again reminds us of the condition of the serf, who, though
<div n="lb"/>legally restrained, still gradually won his way to the rank of a
<div n="lb"/>free man. Rich Śūdras are mentioned in the early texts,<sup>21</sup> just
<div n="lb"/>as Śūdra {%gahapatis,%} ‘householders,’ occur in the Buddhist texts,
<div n="lb"/>and Śūdra kings in the legal literature.<sup>22</sup> Sin against Śūdra and
<div n="lb"/>Āryan is mentioned;<sup>23</sup> prayers for glory on behalf of Śūdras,
<div n="lb"/>as well as of the other castes<sup>24</sup> occur; and the desire to be dear
<div n="lb"/>to Śūdra as well as to Āryan is expressed.<sup>25</sup>
[Page2-391+ 71]
<div n="P"/>The Sūtras also, while they emphasize as general rules
<div n="lb"/>points earlier not insisted on, such as their inferiority in
<div n="lb"/>sitting, etc.,<sup>26</sup> their exclusion from the study of the Vedas,<sup>27</sup>
<div n="lb"/>the danger of contact with them<sup>28</sup> or their food,<sup>29</sup> still recog-
<div n="lb"/>nize that Śūdras can be merchants,<sup>30</sup> or even exercise any
<div n="lb"/>trade.<sup>31</sup>
<div n="P"/>Moreover, the Sūtras<sup>32</sup> permit the marriage of a Śūdrā
<div n="lb"/>woman with members of all castes. Though it was a reproach
<div n="lb"/>to {@Vatsa@}<sup>33</sup> and to {@Kavaṣa@}<sup>34</sup> that they were the sons of a Śūdrā
<div n="lb"/>and a Dāsī respectively, still the possibility of such a reproach
<div n="lb"/>shows that marriages of this kind did take place. Moreover,
<div n="lb"/>illicit unions of Ārya and Śūdrā, or Śūdra and Āryā, are
<div n="lb"/>referred to in the Saṃhitās of the Yajurveda.<sup>35</sup>
<div n="P"/>The origin of the term Śūdra is quite obscure, but Zimmer<sup>36</sup>
<div n="lb"/>points out that Ptolemy<sup>37</sup> mentions <lang n="greek"></lang> as a people, and he
<div n="lb"/>thinks that the Brāhui may be meant. Without laying any
<div n="lb"/>stress on this identification,<sup>38</sup> it is reasonable to accept the
[Page2-392+ 53]
<div n="lb"/>view<sup>39</sup> that the term was originally the name of a large tribe
<div n="lb"/>opposed to the Āryan invasion. See also {@Niṣāda.@}

<div n="lb"/>which in India has been merged in the
<div n="lb"/>Muṇḍā type; but this suggestion is

<div n="lb"/>speaks of the Dasyus as {%anās,%} ‘nose-

<div n="lb"/>to assume that the Brāhuis are a mixed

{@Śyāvāśva@}¦ is the name of a man mentioned several times in
<div n="lb"/>the Rigveda.<sup>1</sup> The Anukramaṇī (Index) assigns to him a
<div n="lb"/>series of hymns in the fifth, eight, and ninth books.<sup>2</sup> In one
<div n="lb"/>of the hymns<sup>3</sup> Śyāvāśva mentions, apparently as his patrons,
<div n="lb"/>{@Taranta@} (a son of {@Vidadaśva@}) and {@Purumīlha,@} as well as
<div n="lb"/>{@Rathavīti.@} On this hymn is based a legend found in the
<div n="lb"/>Bṛhaddevatā,<sup>4</sup> that he was the son of {@Arcanānas,@} who was
<div n="lb"/>sacrificing for Rathavīti Dālbhya. The father was anxious to
<div n="lb"/>obtain the king's daughter for his son in marriage; but though
<div n="lb"/>the father was willing, his wife insisted on her son-in-law being
<div n="lb"/>a Ṛṣi. The father and son, repulsed, were returning home,
<div n="lb"/>when they met on the way Taranta and Purumīḍha, former
<div n="lb"/>patrons of the father. These showed him respect, while
<div n="lb"/>Taranta's wife, Śaśīyasī, presented Śyāvāśva with much wealth.
<div n="lb"/>The son was then fortunate enough to meet the Maruts in the
<div n="lb"/>forest, and praised them, thus becoming a seer. As a result
<div n="lb"/>the king himself ultimately offered his daughter to Śyāvāśva.
<div n="lb"/>Sieg<sup>5</sup> seeks to show that this legend is presupposed in the Rigveda;
<div n="lb"/>but it is difficult to accept this view, since the references in the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda are very obscure, and Śaśīyasī is probably no more
<div n="lb"/>than an epithet.<sup>6</sup> That there is some Itihāsa at the back of the
<div n="lb"/>hymn is clear: what it is can hardly now be determined.
<div n="P"/>Śyāvāśva's obtaining gifts from Vaidadaśvi is referred to also
<div n="lb"/>in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra.<sup>7</sup> His name occurs in the
<div n="lb"/>Atharvaveda<sup>8</sup> in two lists of persons, of which the former
<div n="lb"/>includes Purumīḍha, the latter also Arcanānas and Atri. A
<div n="lb"/>Sāman is ascribed to him in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>9</sup> and
<div n="lb"/>he is perhaps referred to in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka.<sup>10</sup> In the
[Page2-401+ 58]
<div n="lb"/>Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>11</sup> he
<div n="lb"/>is styled Ārcanānasa, ‘son of Arcanānas,’ and later<sup>12</sup> he is called

{@Śveta-ketu@}¦ Aruṇeya<sup>1</sup> (‘descendant of {@Aruṇa@}’) or {@Auddālaki@}<sup>2</sup>
<div n="lb"/>(‘son of {@Uddālaka@}’) is mentioned repeatedly in the Śatapatha
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa and the Chāndogya Upaniṣad. In the Kauṣītaki
<div n="lb"/>Upaniṣad<sup>3</sup> he appears as Śvetaketu, son of {@Āruṇi,@} and as a
<div n="lb"/>{@Gautama.@} In the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa<sup>4</sup> he is quoted as an
<div n="lb"/>authority on the vexed question of the duty of the {@Sadasya,@} or
<div n="lb"/>the seventeenth priest, at the ritual of the Kauṣītakins, to
<div n="lb"/>notify errors in the sacrifice; Āruṇi, his father, is also cited.
<div n="lb"/>He was a person of some originality, for he insisted on eating
<div n="lb"/>honey despite the general prohibition of the use of that
<div n="lb"/>delicacy by Brahmacārins or religious students.<sup>5</sup> He was a
<div n="lb"/>contemporary of, and was instructed by the {@Pañcāla@} king
<div n="lb"/>{@Pravāhaṇa Jaivala.@}<sup>6</sup> He was also a contemporary of {@Janaka,@}
<div n="lb"/>of {@Videha,@} and figured among the Brahmin disputants at his
<div n="lb"/>court.<sup>7</sup> A story is told of him in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta
<div n="lb"/>Sūtra:<sup>8</sup> {@Jala Jātūkarṇya@} was lucky enough to become the
<div n="lb"/>Purohita of three peoples or kings, of {@Kāśi, Kosala,@} and
<div n="lb"/>{@Videha.@} Seeing this, Śvetaketu felt annoyed and reproached
<div n="lb"/>his father with his excessive devotion to sacrifice, which merely
<div n="lb"/>enriched and glorified others, not himself. His father replied,
<div n="lb"/>forbidding him to speak thus: he had learned the true method
<div n="lb"/>of sacrificing, and his ambition in life had been to discuss it
<div n="lb"/>with every Brahmin.
<div n="P"/>All the references to Śvetaketu belong to the latest period of
<div n="lb"/>Vedic literature. It is, therefore, not surprising that the Āpa-
<div n="lb"/>stamba Dharma Sūtra<sup>9</sup> should refer to him as an Avara, or
[Page2-410+ 47]
<div n="lb"/>person of later days, who still became a Ṛṣi by special merit.
<div n="lb"/>His date, however, must not be fixed too low, because the
<div n="lb"/>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa in which he plays so marked a part is
<div n="lb"/>certainly earlier than Pāṇini, and was apparently even in that
<div n="lb"/>grammarian's time believed to be an ancient work: hence
<div n="lb"/>500 B.C. is probably rather too late than too early a period for
<div n="lb"/>Śvetaketu as a rough approximation to a date.<sup>10</sup>

{@Saṃ-vatsara,@}¦ ‘year,’ is repeatedly mentioned from the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda onwards.<sup>1</sup>
<div n="P"/>It duration was, according to the concurrent evidence of
<div n="lb"/>the Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas, 360 days, divided into 12 months,
<div n="lb"/>being, no doubt, roughly a lunar synodic year, which, however,
<div n="lb"/>it exceeded in length by 6 days.<sup>2</sup> As a solar year it appears
<div n="lb"/>only in the Nidāna Sūtra<sup>3</sup> of the Sāmaveda, where the sun is
<div n="lb"/>stated to spend 13(1/3) days in each of the 27 Nakṣatras.
[Page2-412+ 53]
<div n="P"/>The year being obviously out of harmony with the solar year
<div n="lb"/>(whether sidereal or tropical), efforts were certainly made to
<div n="lb"/>effect an assimilation of the natural and the accepted year. As
<div n="lb"/>has been seen (see {@Māsa@}), the evidence goes strongly to show
<div n="lb"/>that the intercalation was not an easy matter in the Brāh-
<div n="lb"/>maṇa period, though there are traces of what may be re-
<div n="lb"/>garded as a five-yearly or six-yearly intercalation. But there
<div n="lb"/>is no conclusive evidence that these periods were really
<div n="lb"/>observed.
<div n="P"/>Zimmer,<sup>4</sup> indeed, considers that the evidence required is
<div n="lb"/>afforded by the lists of the years, which are sometimes
<div n="lb"/>enumerated as five: Saṃvatsara, Parivatsara, Idāvatsara,
<div n="lb"/>Idvatsara, and Vatsara;<sup>5</sup> or Saṃvatsara, Parivatsara, Idāvat-
<div n="lb"/>sara, Iduvatsara, Vatsara;<sup>6</sup> or Saṃvatsara, Idāvatsara, Iduvat-
<div n="lb"/>sara, Idvatsara, Vatsara;<sup>7</sup> or Saṃvatsara, Parivatsara, Idāvat-
<div n="lb"/>sara, Anuvatsara, Udvatsara;<sup>8</sup> or Saṃvatsara, Parivatsara,
<div n="lb"/>Idāvatsara, Anuvatsara, Idvatsara.<sup>9</sup> But it must be noted not
<div n="lb"/>merely that the names vary considerably, but that four only are
<div n="lb"/>mentioned in some places,<sup>10</sup> in others<sup>11</sup> three, in others<sup>12</sup> two,
<div n="lb"/>and in yet others<sup>13</sup> six. Moreover, in none of these enumera-
<div n="lb"/>tions is there any reference to the names being connected with
<div n="lb"/>a system of intercalation. It is most probable that here we
<div n="lb"/>have no more that a mere series of priestly variations of
<div n="lb"/>Vatsara, based on the older and more genuine Saṃvatsara and
<div n="lb"/>Parivatsara as variants of the simple Vatsara, ‘year.’ The key
<div n="lb"/>to the invention of the series is probably to be found in
<div n="lb"/>passages like that of the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>14</sup> where the
<div n="lb"/>several {@Cāturmāsya@} (‘four-monthly’) sacrifices are equated
[Page2-413+ 54]
<div n="lb"/>with the different years.<sup>15</sup> Particularly unjustifiable is the
<div n="lb"/>attempt of Zimmer to see in the two-year series a series of two
<div n="lb"/>years of 354 days each, with an intercalary month in the
<div n="lb"/>second; for the year of 354 days, as such, is not known to have
<div n="lb"/>existed before the Sūtra period.
<div n="P"/>Zimmer<sup>16</sup> also finds an attempt at intercalation in the
<div n="lb"/>famous 12 days in which the Ṛbhus are said to have slept in
<div n="lb"/>the house of Agohya.<sup>17</sup> He thinks that they represent twelve
<div n="lb"/>days added at the winter solstice to equate the lunar year of
<div n="lb"/>354 days and the solar year of 366 days; and from the rever-
<div n="lb"/>ence paid in German antiquity to the ‘12 nights,’ he infers
<div n="lb"/>that this mode of intercalation is Indo-Germanic.<sup>18</sup> There can
<div n="lb"/>be little doubt that this view is wrong, and that the 12 days are
<div n="lb"/>merely the ‘reflexion of the year’ ({%saṃvatsarasya pratimā%})<sup>19</sup> in
<div n="lb"/>the sense that they represent the twelve months, and have no
<div n="lb"/>relation to chronology at all.
<div n="P"/>A reference to the use of Saṃvatsara alone as the fifth year
<div n="lb"/>of the cycle is seen by Shamasastry<sup>20</sup> in the peculiar dating of
<div n="lb"/>certain notices in the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra,<sup>21</sup> but this view
<div n="lb"/>is improbable.<sup>22</sup>

<div n="lb"/>peace<sup>1</sup> or in war,<sup>2</sup> when it means an ‘armed band.’ Its normal
<div n="lb"/>sense in the Atharvaveda<sup>3</sup> and later<sup>4</sup> is ‘war,’ ‘battle.’
[Page2-417+ 50]
<div n="P"/>Little is known of Vedic warfare, but it seems to have been
<div n="lb"/>simple. A body of foot soldiers with charioteers composed
<div n="lb"/>every army, the two going together,<sup>5</sup> and the foot soldiers being
<div n="lb"/>often overthrown by the charioteers,<sup>6</sup> who were doubtless
<div n="lb"/>the Kṣatriyas and their foremost retainers. Probably the
<div n="lb"/>foot soldiers bore little armour, and used only the bow for
<div n="lb"/>offence, as is suggested by the account that Herodotus gives of
<div n="lb"/>the Indian contingent of the army with which Xerxes invaded
<div n="lb"/>Greece.<sup>7</sup> The nobles, on the other hand, may have had cuirass
<div n="lb"/>({@Varman@}), helmet ({@Śiprā@}), and hand-guard ({@Hastaghna@}) as a
<div n="lb"/>protection from the friction of the bowstring. On the car was
<div n="lb"/>the charioteer, and on his left the warrior ({@Sārathi, Savyaṣṭhā@}).
<div n="lb"/>Riding is never mentioned in war,<sup>8</sup> and would hardly have
<div n="lb"/>been suited to Vedic ideas, for the warrior mainly depended on
<div n="lb"/>his bow, which he could not have used effectively from horse-
<div n="lb"/>back. The offensive weapon ({@Āyudha@}) was practically the
<div n="lb"/>bow; spear and sword and axe were very seldom used.
<div n="P"/>Whether there was a strict tribal organization of the host,
<div n="lb"/>such as is once alluded to in the Homeric poems,<sup>9</sup> and is also
<div n="lb"/>recognized in Germany by Tacitus,<sup>10</sup> is uncertain ({%cf.%} {@Vrāta@}),
<div n="lb"/>but in the Epic relations ({@Jñāti@}) fight together,<sup>11</sup> and this rule,
<div n="lb"/>no doubt, applied more or less in Vedic times also.
<div n="P"/>Cities were besieged and invested ({%upa-sad, pra-bhid%}),<sup>12</sup>
<div n="lb"/>probably as a rule by blockade, since the ineffective means of
<div n="lb"/>assault of the time would have rendered storming difficult and
<div n="lb"/>expensive. Hillebrandt<sup>13</sup> thinks that the {%pur cariṣṇū%} of the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda<sup>14</sup> was a kind of chariot; it may — like the Trojan
<div n="lb"/>horse — have been an Indian anticipation of the Roman means
<div n="lb"/>of assaulting a town.
<div n="P"/>Besides ordinary wars of defence and conquest, raids into
[Page2-418+ 50]
<div n="lb"/>neighbouring territory seem to have been frequent and normal,<sup>15</sup>
<div n="lb"/>no doubt because of the booty ({@Udāja, Nirāja@}) which was to be
<div n="lb"/>won, and which the king had to share with the people.
<div n="P"/>Banners ({@Dhvaja@}) were borne in war, and musical instru-
<div n="lb"/>ments ({@Dundubhi, Bakura@})<sup>16</sup> were used by the combatants.

{@Sabhā@}¦ is the name of an ‘assembly’ of the Vedic Indians as
<div n="lb"/>well as of the ‘hall’ where they met in assembly. It is often
<div n="lb"/>mentioned in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later,<sup>2</sup> but its exact character is
<div n="lb"/>not certain. The hall was clearly used for dicing,<sup>3</sup> presumably
<div n="lb"/>when the assembly was not transacting public business: a
<div n="lb"/>dicer is called {%sabhā-sthāṇu,%} ‘pillar of the assembly hall,’ doubt-
<div n="lb"/>less because of his constant presence there.<sup>4</sup> The hall also
<div n="lb"/>served, like the Homeric <lang n="greek"></lang>, as a meeting-place for social
<div n="lb"/>intercourse and general conversation about cows and so forth,<sup>5</sup>
<div n="lb"/>possibly for debates and verbal contests.<sup>6</sup>
<div n="P"/>According to Ludwig,<sup>7</sup> the Sabhā was an assembly not of all
<div n="lb"/>the people, but of the Brahmins and {@Maghavans@} (‘rich
<div n="lb"/>patrons’). This view can be supported by the expressions
[Page2-427+ 62]
<div n="lb"/>{%sabheya,%} ‘worthy of the assembly,’ applied to a Brahmin,<sup>8</sup> {%rayiḥ%}
<div n="lb"/>{%sabhāvān,%} ‘wealth fitting for the assembly,’<sup>9</sup> and so on. But
<div n="lb"/>Bloomfield<sup>10</sup> plausibly sees in these passages a domestic use of
<div n="lb"/>Sabhā, which is recognized by the St. Petersburg Dictionary
<div n="lb"/>in several passages<sup>11</sup> as relating to a house, not to the assembly
<div n="lb"/>at all. Zimmer<sup>12</sup> is satisfied that the Sabhā was the meeting-
<div n="lb"/>place of the village council, presided over by the {@Grāmaṇī.@}
<div n="lb"/>But of this there is no trace whatever. Hillebrandt<sup>13</sup> seems
<div n="lb"/>right in maintaining that the Sabhā and the {@Samiti@} cannot be
<div n="lb"/>distinguished, and that the reference to well-born ({%su-jāta%})<sup>14</sup>
<div n="lb"/>men being there in session is to the Āryan as opposed to the
<div n="lb"/>Dāsa or Śūdra, not to one class of Āryan as opposed to the
<div n="lb"/>other. Hillebrandt also sees in Agni ‘of the hall’ ({%sabhya%}) a
<div n="lb"/>trace of the fire used in sacrifice on behalf of the assembly

<div n="lb"/>and that in many places Samudra is metaphorically used, as of
<div n="lb"/>the two oceans,<sup>7</sup> the lower and the upper oceans,<sup>8</sup> etc. In

<div n="lb"/>when it receives all its Panjab tributaries.<sup>9</sup> It is probable that

<L>3502<pc>2-434<k1>sarasvatI<k2>sarasvatI
{@Sarasvatī@}¦<sup>1</sup> is the name of a river frequently mentioned in
<div n="lb"/>the Rigveda and later. In many passages<sup>2</sup> of the later texts it
<div n="lb"/>is certain the river meant is the modern Sarasvatī, which loses
[Page2-435+ 70]
<div n="lb"/>itself in the sands of Patiala (see {@Vinaśana@}). Even Roth<sup>3</sup>
<div n="lb"/>admits that this river is intended in some passages of the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda. With the {@Dṛṣadvatī@}<sup>4</sup> it formed the western boundary
<div n="lb"/>of Brahmāvarta (see {@Madhyadeśa@}). It is the holy stream of
<div n="lb"/>early Vedic India. The Sūtras<sup>5</sup> mention sacrifices held on its
<div n="lb"/>banks as of great importance and sanctity.
<div n="P"/>In many other passages of the Rigveda,<sup>6</sup> and even later,<sup>7</sup>
<div n="lb"/>Roth held that another river, the {@Sindhu@} (Indus), was really
<div n="lb"/>meant: only thus could it be explained why the Sarasvatī is
<div n="lb"/>called the ‘foremost of rivers’ ({%nadītamā%}),<sup>8</sup> is said to go to the
<div n="lb"/>ocean,<sup>9</sup> and is referred to as a large river, on the banks of which
<div n="lb"/>many kings,<sup>10</sup> and, indeed, the five tribes, were located.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="lb"/>This view is accepted by Zimmer<sup>12</sup> and others.<sup>13</sup>
<div n="P"/>On the other hand, Lassen<sup>14</sup> and Max Müller<sup>15</sup> maintain the
<div n="lb"/>identity of the Vedic Sarasvatī with the later Sarasvatī.<sup>16</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>latter is of opinion that in Vedic times the Sarasvatī was as
<div n="lb"/>large a stream as the Sutlej, and that it actually reached the
[Page2-436+ 51]
<div n="lb"/>sea either after union with the Indus or not, being the ‘iron
<div n="lb"/>citadel,’ as the last boundary on the west, a frontier of the
<div n="lb"/>Panjab against the rest of India. There is no conclusive
<div n="lb"/>evidence of there having been any great change in the size or
<div n="lb"/>course of the Sarasvatī, though it would be impossible to deny
<div n="lb"/>that the river may easily have diminished in size. But there
<div n="lb"/>are strong reasons to accept the identification of the later and
<div n="lb"/>the earlier Sarasvatī throughout. The insistence on the divine
<div n="lb"/>character of the river is been in the very hymn<sup>17</sup> which refers
<div n="lb"/>to it as the support of the five tribes, and corresponds well with
<div n="lb"/>its later sacredness. Moreover, that hymn alludes to the
<div n="lb"/>{@Pārāvatas,@} a people shown by the later evidence of the Pañca-
<div n="lb"/>viṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>18</sup> to have been in the east, a very long way
<div n="lb"/>from their original home, if Sarasvatī means the Indus. Again,
<div n="lb"/>the {@Pūrus,@} who were settled on the Sarasvatī,<sup>19</sup> could with great
<div n="lb"/>difficulty be located in the far west. Moreover, the five tribes
<div n="lb"/>might easily be held to be on the Sarasvatī, when they were, as
<div n="lb"/>they seem to have been, the western neighbours of the {@Bharatas@}
<div n="lb"/>in {@Kurukṣetra,@} and the Sarasvatī could easily be regarded
<div n="lb"/>as the boundary of the Panjab in that sense. Again, the
<div n="lb"/>‘seven rivers’ in one passage<sup>20</sup> clearly designate a district: it
<div n="lb"/>is most probable that they are not the five rivers with the
<div n="lb"/>Indus and the {@Kubhā@} (Cabul river), but the five rivers, the
<div n="lb"/>Indus and the Sarasvatī. Nor is it difficult to see why the river
<div n="lb"/>is said to flow to the sea: either the Vedic poet had never
<div n="lb"/>followed the course of the river to its end, or the river did
<div n="lb"/>actually penetrate the desert either completely or for a long
<div n="lb"/>distance, and only in the Brāhmaṇa period was its disappear-
[Page2-437+ 50]
<div n="lb"/>ance in the desert found out. It is said, indeed, in the
<div n="lb"/>Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>21</sup> that the five rivers go to the Sarasvatī,
<div n="lb"/>but this passage is not only late (as the use of the word {@Deśa@}
<div n="lb"/>shows), but it does not say that the five rivers meant are those
<div n="lb"/>of the Panjab. Moreover, the passage has neither a parallel
<div n="lb"/>in the other Saṃhitās, nor can it possibly be regarded as an
<div n="lb"/>early production; if it is late it must refer to the later
<div n="lb"/>Sarasvatī.
<div n="P"/>Hillebrandt,<sup>22</sup> on the whole, adopts this view of the Saras-
<div n="lb"/>vatī,<sup>23</sup> but he also sees in it, besides the designation of a
<div n="lb"/>mythical stream, the later Vaitaraṇī,<sup>24</sup> as well as the name of the
<div n="lb"/>Arghandab in Arachosia.<sup>25</sup> This opinion depends essentially
<div n="lb"/>on his theory that the sixth Maṇḍala of the Rigveda places the
<div n="lb"/>scene of its action in Iranian lands, as opposed to the seventh
<div n="lb"/>Maṇḍala: it is as untenable as that theory itself.<sup>26</sup> Brunn-
<div n="lb"/>hofer<sup>27</sup> at one time accepted the Iranian identification, but
<div n="lb"/>later<sup>28</sup> decided for the Oxus, which is quite out of the question.

<div n="lb"/>{%svasā%}). In vii. 36, 6, she is called the
<div n="lb"/>‘seventh,’ which makes the Sarasvatī
<div n="lb"/>one of the rivers. If the former passages
<div n="lb"/>are to be treated as precise, then {%sapta-%}
<div n="lb"/>{%svasā%} may be considered to show that

<L>3652<pc>2-465<k1>sUrya<k2>sUrya
{@Sūrya,@}¦ the ‘sun,’ plays a great part in Vedic mythology and
<div n="lb"/>religion,<sup>1</sup> corresponding with the importance of the sun as a
<div n="lb"/>factor in the physical life of the peninsula. In the Rigveda<sup>2</sup>
<div n="lb"/>the sun is normally regarded as a beneficent power, a not
<div n="lb"/>unnatural view in a people which must apparently have issued
<div n="lb"/>from the cold regions of the Himālaya mountains. Its heat
<div n="lb"/>is, however, alluded to in some passages of the Rigveda,<sup>3</sup> as
<div n="lb"/>well as referred to in the Atharvaveda and the literature of the
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇas.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>In one myth Indra is said to have vanquished Sūrya and to
<div n="lb"/>have stolen his wheel:<sup>5</sup> this is possibly a reference to the
[Page2-466+ 62]
<div n="lb"/>obscuration of the sun by a thunderstorm.<sup>6</sup> The Aitareya
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa<sup>7</sup> presents a naive conception of the course of the
<div n="lb"/>sun, which it regards as bright on one side only, and as
<div n="lb"/>returning from west to east by the same road, but with the
<div n="lb"/>reverse side turned towards the earth, thus at night illumining
<div n="lb"/>the stars in heaven.<sup>8</sup> In the Rigveda<sup>9</sup> wonder is expressed
<div n="lb"/>that the sun does not fall.
<div n="P"/>There are several references to eclipses in the Rigveda. In
<div n="lb"/>one passage<sup>10</sup> Svarbhānu, a demon, is said to have eclipsed the
<div n="lb"/>sun with darkness, while {@Atri@} restores the light of the sun, a
<div n="lb"/>similar feat being elsewhere attributed to his family, the Atris.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="lb"/>In the Atharvaveda<sup>12</sup> {@Rāhu@} appears for the first time in con-
<div n="lb"/>nexion with the sun. Indra's defeat of Sūrya<sup>6</sup> may also be
<div n="lb"/>explained as alluding to an eclipse; in two other passages<sup>13</sup>
<div n="lb"/>such an interpretation seems at least probable. Ludwig<sup>14</sup> not
<div n="lb"/>only argues that the Rigveda knows the theory of eclipses
<div n="lb"/>caused by an occultation of the sun by the moon, and regards
<div n="lb"/>the sun as going round the earth,<sup>15</sup> but even endeavours to
<div n="lb"/>identify an eclipse referred to in the Rigveda with one that
<div n="lb"/>occurred in 1029 B.C. These views are completely refuted by
<div n="lb"/>Whitney.<sup>16</sup>
<div n="P"/>The sun as a maker of time<sup>17</sup> determines the year of 360 days,
<div n="lb"/>which is the civil year and the usual year ({@Saṃvatsara@}) of
[Page2-467+ 70]
<div n="lb"/>Vedic literature. This solar year is divided into two halves — 
<div n="lb"/>the Uttarāyaṇa,<sup>18</sup> when the sun goes north, and the Dakṣiṇā-
<div n="lb"/>yana,<sup>19</sup> when it goes south. There can be no doubt that these
<div n="lb"/>periods denote the time when the sun turns north from the
<div n="lb"/>winter solstice, and when it turns south from the summer
<div n="lb"/>solstice, for the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa<sup>20</sup> says so in perfectly clear
<div n="lb"/>language. The alternative theory is to regard the periods as
<div n="lb"/>those when the sun is in the north — {%i.e.,%} when it is north of the
<div n="lb"/>equator, and when it is in the south, taking as points of depar-

<div n="lb"/>These views are clearly quite wrong.
<div n="lb"/>The notions of the sun given in the
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇas are all very naive and
<div n="lb"/>simple; the distance of heaven and
<div n="lb"/>the sun from the earth is the height
<div n="lb"/>of a thousand cows one on the top
<div n="lb"/>of the other (Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>xvi. 8, 6), or forty-four days' journey
<div n="lb"/>for a horse ({%ibid.,%} xxv. 10, 16), or a
<div n="lb"/>thousand days' journey for a horse
<div n="lb"/>(Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 17, 8), or a
<div n="lb"/>hundred leagues (Kausītaki Brāhmaṇa,
<div n="lb"/>viii. 3). They record also such facts
<div n="lb"/>as that the sun rises from and sets in
<div n="lb"/>the waters (Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 20,
<div n="lb"/>13; {%of.%} Nirukta, vi. 17; Kauṣītaki
<div n="lb"/>Brāhmaṇa, xxiv. 4, 5; xxvi. 1), and
<div n="lb"/>that it sets in the west ({%ibid.,%} xviii. 9).
<div n="lb"/>The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa calls the sun
<div n="lb"/>circular (vii. 4, 1, 17), and also four-

{@Sṛñjaya@}¦ is the name of a people mentioned as early as the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda. Sṛñjaya (that is, the king of this people) {@Daivavāta@}
<div n="lb"/>is celebrated as victorious over the {@Turvaśas@} and the {@Vṛcī-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@vants,@}<sup>1</sup> and his sacrificial fire is referred to.<sup>2</sup> In connexion
<div n="lb"/>with Daivavāta is also mentioned {@Sāhadevya Somaka,@}<sup>3</sup> no
<div n="lb"/>doubt another prince; for in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>4</sup> we find
<div n="lb"/>Somaka Sāhadevya and his father, Sahadeva (originally {@Suplan@})
<div n="lb"/>Sārñjaya, as kings who were anointed by {@Parvata@} and
<div n="lb"/>{@Nārada.@} The Rigveda<sup>5</sup> has also a Dānastuti (‘praise of gifts’)
<div n="lb"/>of {@Prastoka,@}<sup>6</sup> a Sṛñjaya, who is lauded along with {@Divodāsa.@}
<div n="lb"/>Moreover, {@Vītahavya@}<sup>7</sup> seems to have been a Sṛñjaya, though
<div n="lb"/>Zimmer<sup>8</sup> prefers to take the derivative word, {@Vaitahavya,@} not
<div n="lb"/>as a patronymic, but as an epithet.
<div n="P"/>It seems probable that the Sṛñjayas and the {@Tṛtsus@} were
<div n="lb"/>closely allied, for Divodāsa and a Sṛñjaya prince are celebrated
<div n="lb"/>together,<sup>9</sup> and the Turvaśas were enemies of both.<sup>10</sup> This view
<div n="lb"/>is borne out by the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>11</sup> which recognizes
<div n="lb"/>{@Devabhāga Śrautarṣa@} as Purohita of the {@Kurus@} and the
<div n="lb"/>Sṛñjayas.
[Page2-470+ 49]
<div n="P"/>On the other hand, some disaster certainly befel the Sṛñjayas,
<div n="lb"/>at least the Vaitahavyas, for they are said in the Atharvaveda<sup>12</sup>
<div n="lb"/>to have offended the {@Bhṛgus@} and to have ended miserably.
<div n="lb"/>There is, it is true, no precise confirmation of this notice, but
<div n="lb"/>both the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>13</sup> and the Taittirīya Saṃhitā,<sup>14</sup> in
<div n="lb"/>independent passages, refer to the Sṛñjayas having sustained
<div n="lb"/>some serious loss, though the notice is in each case coupled
<div n="lb"/>with a ritual error, much as in the Old Testament the fate
<div n="lb"/>of kings depends on their devotion to Jahve or their dis-
<div n="lb"/>obedience. It is justifiable to recognize some disaster in this
<div n="lb"/>allusion.
<div n="P"/>The geographical position of the Sṛñjayas is uncertain.
<div n="lb"/>Hillebrandt<sup>15</sup> suggests that in early times they must be looked
<div n="lb"/>for west of the Indus with Divodāsa; he also mentions, though
<div n="lb"/>he does not definitely adopt, the suggestion of Brunnhofer that
<div n="lb"/>the Sṛñjayas are to be compared with the <lang n="greek"></lang><sup>16</sup> of the
<div n="lb"/>Greeks, and to be located in Drangiana. Zimmer<sup>17</sup> is inclined
<div n="lb"/>to locate them on the upper Indus; but it is difficult to decide
<div n="lb"/>definitely in favour of any particular location. They may well
<div n="lb"/>have been a good deal farther east than the Indus, since their
<div n="lb"/>allies, the Tṛtsus, were in the {@Madhyadeśa,@} and were certainly
<div n="lb"/>absorbed in the Kurus.
<div n="P"/>Of the history of this clan we have one notice.<sup>18</sup> They
<div n="lb"/>expelled {@Duṣṭarītu Pauṃsāyana,@} one of their kings, from the
<div n="lb"/>hereditary monarchy — of ten generations — and also drove out
<div n="lb"/>{@Revottaras Pāṭava Cākra Sthapati,@} probably his minister,
<div n="lb"/>who, however, succeeded in effecting the restoration of the
<div n="lb"/>king, despite the opposition of the Kuru prince, {@Balhika@}
<div n="lb"/>{@Prātīpya.@} Very probably this Kuru prince may have been at
<div n="lb"/>the bottom of the movement which led to the expulsion of the
<div n="lb"/>king and his minister. But the restoration of the king can
[Page2-471+ 46]
<div n="lb"/>hardly be regarded, in accordance with Bloomfield's view,<sup>19</sup> as a
<div n="lb"/>defeat of the Sṛñjayas.

<L>3673<pc>2-474<k1>soma<k2>soma
{@Soma@}¦ was the famous plant which was used for the prepara-
<div n="lb"/>tion of the libation of Soma made at the Vedic sacrifice. Its
<div n="lb"/>importance is sufficiently shown by the fact that the whole of
<div n="lb"/>the ninth Maṇḍala of the Rigveda, and six hymns in other
<div n="lb"/>Maṇḍalas, are devoted to its praise.
<div n="P"/>Nevertheless, little is actually known of the plant. Its twigs
<div n="lb"/>or shoots are described as brown ({%babhru%}),<sup>1</sup> ruddy ({%aruṇa%}),<sup>2</sup> of
<div n="lb"/>tawny ({%hari%}).<sup>3</sup> Possibly its twigs hang down if the epithet
<div n="lb"/>{@Naicāśākha@}<sup>4</sup> refers to the plant as Hillebrandt<sup>5</sup> thinks. The
<div n="lb"/>shoot is called {%aṃśu,%}<sup>6</sup> while the plant as a whole is called
<div n="lb"/>{%andhas,%}<sup>7</sup> which also denotes the juice.<sup>8</sup> {%Parvan%}<sup>9</sup> is the stem.
<div n="lb"/>{%Kṣip,%}<sup>10</sup> ‘finger,’ is used as a designation of the shoots, which may
<div n="lb"/>therefore have resembled fingers in shape; {%vakṣaṇā%}<sup>11</sup> and {%vāṇa%}<sup>12</sup>
<div n="lb"/>also seem to have the sense of the shoot. There is some slight.
<div n="lb"/>evidence to suggest that the stem was not round, but angular.<sup>13</sup>
[Page2-475+ 61]
<div n="lb"/>The plant grew on the mountains,<sup>14</sup> that of {@Müjavant@} being
<div n="lb"/>specially renowned.
<div n="P"/>These notices are inadequate to identify the plant. It has
<div n="lb"/>been held<sup>15</sup> to be the {%Sarcostemma viminale%} or the {%Asclepias acida%}
<div n="lb"/>{%(= Sarcostemma brevistigma).%} Roth<sup>16</sup> held that the {%Sarcostemma%}
<div n="lb"/>{%acidum%} more nearly met the requirements of the case. Watt<sup>17</sup>
<div n="lb"/>suggested the Afghan grape as the real Soma, and Rice<sup>18</sup>
<div n="lb"/>thought a sugar-cane might be meant, while Max Müller and
<div n="lb"/>Rājendralāla Mitra suggested that the juice was used as an
<div n="lb"/>ingredient in a kind of beer — {%i.e.,%} that the Soma plant was a
<div n="lb"/>species of hop. Hillebrandt<sup>19</sup> considers that neither hops nor
<div n="lb"/>the grape can explain the references to Soma. It is very
<div n="lb"/>probable that the plant cannot now be identified.<sup>20</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Yajurveda<sup>21</sup> the plant is purchased ere it is pressed.
<div n="lb"/>Hillebrandt<sup>22</sup> considers that the sale must be assumed for the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda. It grew on a mountain, and could not be obtained
<div n="lb"/>by ordinary people: perhaps some special tribe or prince
<div n="lb"/>owned it, like the {@Kīkaṭas.@}<sup>23</sup> As it stands, the ritual perform-
<div n="lb"/>ance is clearly an acquisition of the Soma from the Gandharvas
<div n="lb"/>(represented by a Śūdra), a ritual imitation of the action which
<div n="lb"/>may have been one of the sources of the drama. Owing
<div n="lb"/>to the difficulty of obtaining the real plant from a great
[Page2-476+ 61]
<div n="lb"/>distance, several substitutes were allowed in the Brāhmaṇa
<div n="lb"/>period.<sup>24</sup>
<div n="P"/>The plant was prepared for use by being pounded with stones
<div n="lb"/>or in a mortar. The former was the normal method of pro-
<div n="lb"/>cedure, appearing in the Rigveda as the usual one. The stones
<div n="lb"/>are called {%grāvan%}<sup>25</sup> or {%adri,%}<sup>26</sup> and were, of course, held in the
<div n="lb"/>hands.<sup>27</sup> The plant was laid on boards one beside the other
<div n="lb"/>({@Adhiṣavana@}), and, according at least to the later ritual,<sup>28</sup> a
<div n="lb"/>hole was dug below, so that the pounding of the plant by
<div n="lb"/>means of the stones resulted in a loud noise, doubtless a
<div n="lb"/>prophylactic against demoniac influences.
<div n="P"/>The plant was placed on a skin and on the Vedi<sup>29</sup> — which
<div n="lb"/>was no longer done in the later ritual — {@Dhiṣaṇā@} in some
<div n="lb"/>passages denoting the Vedi.<sup>30</sup>
<div n="P"/>Sometimes the mortar and pestle were used in place of the
<div n="lb"/>stones.<sup>31</sup> This use, though Iranian, was apparently not common
<div n="lb"/>in Vedic times.

<div n="lb"/>applied to the plant itself; but the

<div n="lb"/>{@Sruva@}<sup>41</sup> denotes the ‘ladle.’
<div n="P"/>Apparently the plant was sometimes steeped in water to
<div n="lb"/>increase its yield of juice.<sup>42</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is not possible to describe exactly the details of the process
<div n="lb"/>of pressing the Soma as practised in the Rigveda. It was
<div n="lb"/>certainly purified by being pressed through a sieve<sup>43</sup> ({@Pavitra@}).
<div n="lb"/>The Soma was then used unmixed ({%śukra,%}<sup>44</sup> {%śuci%})<sup>45</sup> for Indra and
<div n="lb"/>{@Vāyu,@} but the {@Kaṇvas@} seem to have dropped this usage.<sup>46</sup> The
<div n="lb"/>juice is described as brown ({%babhru%}),<sup>47</sup> tawny ({%hari%}),<sup>48</sup> or ruddy
<div n="lb"/>({%aruṇa%}),<sup>49</sup> and as having a fragrant smell,<sup>50</sup> at least as a
<div n="lb"/>rule.<sup>51</sup>
<div n="P"/>Soma was mixed with milk ({@Gavāśir@}),<sup>52</sup> curd or sour milk
<div n="lb"/>({@Dadhyāśir@}),<sup>53</sup> or grain ({@Yavāśir@}).<sup>54</sup> The admixtures are
[Page2-478+ 67]
<div n="lb"/>alluded to with various figurative expressions, as {@Atka,@}
<div n="lb"/>‘armour’;<sup>55</sup> {@Vastra@}<sup>56</sup> or {@Vāsas,@}<sup>57</sup> ‘garment’; {@Abhiśrī,@}<sup>58</sup> ‘admix-

<div n="lb"/>{%prayas,%}<sup>62</sup> ‘dainty’; and perhaps {%nabhas,%}<sup>63</sup> ‘fragrance.’ The
<div n="lb"/>adjective {%tīvra%}<sup>64</sup> denotes the ‘pungent’ flavour of Soma when
<div n="lb"/>so mixed. The Soma shoots, after the juice has been pressed
<div n="lb"/>out, are denoted by {%ṛjīṣa,%} ‘residue.’<sup>65</sup>
<div n="P"/>It seems probable that in some cases honey was mixed with
<div n="lb"/>Soma: perhaps the {%kośa madhu-ścut,%} ‘the pail distilling sweet-
<div n="lb"/>ness,’ was used for the mixing.<sup>66</sup> It seems doubtful if Surā was
<div n="lb"/>ever so mixed.<sup>67</sup>
<div n="P"/>There were three pressings a day of Soma, as opposed to the
<div n="lb"/>two of the Avesta.<sup>68</sup> The evening pressing was specially
<div n="lb"/>connected with the Ṛbhus, the midday with Indra, the
<div n="lb"/>morning with Agni, but the ritual shows that many other gods
<div n="lb"/>also had their share.<sup>69</sup> The drinker of Soma and the non-
<div n="lb"/>drinker are sharply discriminated in the texts.<sup>70</sup> Localities
<div n="lb"/>where Soma was consumed were {@Ārjīka, Pastyāvant, Śarya-@}
<div n="lb"/>{@ṇāvant, Suṣomā,@} the territory of the {@Pañcajanāḥ@} or ‘five
[Page2-479+ 64]
<div n="lb"/>peoples,’ and so on.<sup>71</sup> The effects of Soma in exhilarating and
<div n="lb"/>exciting the drinkers are often alluded to.<sup>72</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is difficult to decide if Soma was ever a popular, as opposed
<div n="lb"/>to a hieratic drink. The evidence for its actual popularity is
<div n="lb"/>very slight,<sup>73</sup> and not decisive.

{@Strī@}¦ is the ordinary word in poetry and prose for ‘woman,’
<div n="lb"/>without special reference to her as a wife or as a maiden. {@Nārī@}
<div n="lb"/>has the same sense, but disappears in later prose, while {@Gnā@}
<div n="lb"/>refers only to the wives of the gods, and {@Yoṣit,@} with its cognate
<div n="lb"/>words, denotes the young woman as ripe for marriage.<sup>1</sup> In the
<div n="lb"/>Rigveda<sup>2</sup> Strī stands opposed to {@Pumāṃs,@} ‘man,’ and once to
<div n="lb"/>{%vṛṣan,%} ‘male person’; not until the Atharvaveda<sup>3</sup> does it mean
<div n="lb"/>‘wife’ as opposed to {@Pati,@} ‘husband,’ and even in the Sūtras it
<div n="lb"/>is sharply opposed to {@Jāyā.@}
<div n="P"/>In Vedic India by far the greater part of a woman's life was
<div n="lb"/>taken up in her marriage and marital relations (see Pati and
<div n="lb"/>{@Mātṛ@}). There is no trace in the Rigveda of the seclusion
<div n="lb"/>of women, which was practically complete in all but the
<div n="lb"/>earliest Epic:<sup>4</sup> the maiden may be assumed to have grown up
<div n="lb"/>in her father's house, enjoying free intercourse with the youth
<div n="lb"/>of the village, and sharing in the work of the house. Educa-
<div n="lb"/>tion<sup>5</sup> was not denied to them, at any rate in certain cases, for
<div n="lb"/>we hear in the Upaniṣads of women who could take no
<div n="lb"/>unimportant part in disputations on philosophical topics.
<div n="lb"/>Moreover, women were taught to dance and sing, which were
<div n="lb"/>unmanly accomplishments.<sup>6</sup>
<div n="P"/>Of the exact legal position of daughters the notices are few
<div n="lb"/>and meagre. The Rigveda,<sup>7</sup> however, shows that in the place
[Page2-486+ 60]
<div n="lb"/>of a father the brother was looked to for aid, and that brother-
<div n="lb"/>less maidens were apt to be ruined, though religious terrors
<div n="lb"/>were believed to await the man who took advantage of their
<div n="lb"/>defencelessness.<sup>8</sup> Moreover, women could not take an inherit-
<div n="lb"/>ance,<sup>9</sup> and were not independent persons in the eyes of the
<div n="lb"/>law, whether married or not. Presumably before marriage
<div n="lb"/>they lived on their parents or brothers, and after that on their
<div n="lb"/>husbands, while in the event of their husbands predeceasing
<div n="lb"/>them, their relatives took the property, burdened with the
<div n="lb"/>necessity of maintaining the wife.<sup>10</sup> Their earnings would be
<div n="lb"/>appropriated by their nearest relative — usually father or brother
<div n="lb"/>-in the few cases in which unmarried women could earn
<div n="lb"/>anything, as in the case of courtezans.

<F>2) {%Op. cit.,%} 64, 104 {%et seq.%}</F>
<>however, considers that Paiśācī was the speech used in the
<>Vindhya region. It would be unwise, as a matter of fact, to
<>lay stress on the phrase {%he 'lavo,%} because both the reading and the
<>sense are by no means certain.
<F>3) It should be noted that the phrase
<>cannot be genuine Prākrit as it stands,
<>for that would not give us {%he 'lavo%}
<>{%he 'lavaḥ.%}</F> But it should be noted that
<>the easterners and the Asuras are elsewhere in the Śatapatha
