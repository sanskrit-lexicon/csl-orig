1. {@Akṣa,@}¦ ‘axle,’ is a part of a chariot often referred to in
the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later. It was apparently<sup>2</sup> fastened to the
body of the chariot ({@Kośa@}) by straps ({%akṣā-nah,%} lit. ‘tied to the
axle,’ though this word is also<sup>3</sup> rendered ‘horse’). The
heating of the axle and the danger of its breaking were known.<sup>4</sup>
The part of the axle round which the nave of the wheel
revolved was called Āṇi, ‘pin.’

2. {@Akṣa.@}¦ — This word occurs frequently, from the Rigveda
onwards, both in the singular and plural, meaning ‘die’ and
‘dice.’ Dicing, along with horse-racing, was one of the main
amusements of the Vedic Indian; but, despite the frequent
mention of the game in the literature, there is considerable
difficulty in obtaining any clear picture of the mode in which it
was played.
<div n="P"/>(1) {%The Material.%} — The dice appear normally to have been
made of Vibhīdaka nuts. Such dice are alluded to in both the
Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and the Atharvaveda,<sup>2</sup> hence being called ‘brown’
({%babhru%}), and ‘born on a windy spot.’<sup>3</sup> In the ritual game of
dice at the Agnyādheya and the Rājasūya ceremonies the
material of the dice is not specified, but it is possible that
occasionally gold imitations of Vibhīdaka nuts were used.<sup>4</sup>
There is no clear trace in the Vedic literature of the later use
of cowries as dice.<sup>5</sup>
<div n="P"/>(2) {%The Number.%} — In the Rigveda<sup>6</sup> the dicer is described as
‘leader of a great horde’ ({%senānīr mahato gaṇasya%}), and in
another passage<sup>7</sup> the number is given as {%tri-pañcāśaḥ,%} an expres-
sion which has been variously interpreted. Ludwig,<sup>8</sup> Weber,<sup>9</sup>
and Zimmer<sup>10</sup> render it as fifteen, which is grammatically
hardly possible. Roth<sup>11</sup> and Grassmann<sup>12</sup> render it as ‘con-
sisting of fifty-three.’ Lüders<sup>13</sup> takes it as ‘consisting of one
hundred and fifty,’ but he points out that this may be merely a
vague expression for a large number. For a small number
Zimmer<sup>14</sup> cites a reference in the Rigveda<sup>15</sup> to one who fears
‘him who holds four’ ({%caturaś cid dadamānāt%}), but the sense of
that passage is dependent on the view taken of the method of
playing the game.
<div n="P"/>(3) {%The Method of Play.%} — In several passages of the later
[Page1-003+ 49]
Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas lists are given of expressions con-
nected with dicing. The names are Kṛta, Tretā, Dvāpara,
Āskanda, and Abhibhū in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā.<sup>16</sup> In the
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā,<sup>17</sup> among the victims at the Puruṣamedha,
the {%kitava%} is offered to the Akṣarāja, the {%ādinava-darśa%} to the
Kṛta, the {%kalpin%} to the Tretā, the {%adhi-kalpin%} to the Dvāpara,
the {%sabhā-sthāṇu%} to the Āskanda. The lists in the parallel
version of the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa are {%kitava, sabhāvin, ādinava-%}
{%darśa, bahiḥ-sad,%} and {%sabhā-sthāṇu,%}<sup>18</sup> and Aksarāja, Kṛta, Tretā,
Dvāpara, and Kali. From the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>19</sup> it appears
that another name of Kali was Abhibhū, and the parallel lists
in the Taittirīya and Vājasaneyi Saṃhitās suggest that Abhibhū
and Akṣarāja are identical, though both appear in the late
Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa list. The names of some of these throws
go back even to the Rigveda and the Atharvaveda. Kali occurs
in the latter,<sup>20</sup> and Lüders<sup>21</sup> shows that in a considerable number
of passages in the former Kṛta means a ‘throw’ (not ‘a stake’<sup>22</sup>
or ‘what is won’<sup>23</sup> and this sense is clearly found in the
Atharvaveda.<sup>24</sup> Moreover, that there were more throws ({%ayāḥ%})
than one is proved by a passage in the Rigveda,<sup>25</sup> when
the gods are compared to throws as giving or destroying
wealth.
<div n="P"/>The nature of the throws is obscure. The St. Petersburg
Dictionary conjectures that the names given above were applied
either to dice marked 4, 3, 2, or 1, or to the sides of the dice so
marked, and the latter interpretation is supported by some late
commentators.<sup>26</sup> But there is no evidence for the former
interpretation, and, as regards the latter, the shape of the
Vibhīdaka nuts,<sup>27</sup> used as dice, forbids any side being properly
on the top. Light is thrown on the expressions by the descrip-
[Page1-004+ 52]
tion of a ritual game<sup>28</sup> at the Agnyādheya and at the Rājasūya
ceremonies. The details are not certain,<sup>29</sup> but it is clear that
the game consisted in securing even numbers of dice, usually a
number divisible by four, the Kṛta, the other three throws then
being the Tretā, when three remained over after division by
four; the Dvāpara, when two was the remainder; and the Kali,
when one remained. If five were the dividing number, then the
throw which showed no remainder was Kali, the Kṛta was that
when four was left, and so on. The dice had no numerals
marked on them, the only question being what was the total
number of the dice themselves.
<div n="P"/>There is no reason to doubt that the game as played in the
Rigveda was based on the same principle, though the details
must remain doubtful. The number of dice used was certainly
large,<sup>30</sup> and the reference to throwing fours,<sup>31</sup> and losing by one,
points to the use of the Kṛta as the winning throw. The
Atharvaveda,<sup>32</sup> on the other hand, possibly knew of the Kali as
the winning throw. In one respect the ordinary game must
have differed from the ritual game. In the latter the players
merely pick out the number of dice required — no doubt to avoid
ominous errors, such as must have happened if a real game had
been played. In the secular game the dice were thrown,<sup>33</sup>
perhaps on the principle suggested by Lüders:<sup>34</sup> the one
throwing a certain number on the place of playing, and the other
then throwing a number to make up with those already thrown
a multiple of four or five. This theory, at any rate, accounts for
the later stress laid on the power of computation in a player,
as in the Nala.
<div n="P"/>No board appears to have been used, but a depression on which
[Page1-005+ 60]
the dice were thrown ({%adhi-devana, devana,%}<sup>35</sup> {%iriṇa%}<sup>36</sup> ), was made
in the ground. No dice box was used, but reference is made to
a case for keeping dice in ({%akṣa-vapana%}<sup>37</sup> The throw was called
{%graha%}<sup>38</sup> or earlier {%grābha.%}<sup>39</sup> The stake is called {%vij.%}<sup>40</sup> Serious
losses could be made at dicing: in the Rigveda a dicer laments
the loss of all his property, including his wife.<sup>41</sup> Lüders<sup>42</sup> finds
a different form of the game referred to in the Chāndogya
Upaniṣad.<sup>43</sup>

three, the Tretā six, and the Kṛta all
ten. This explanation seems harsh.

sores designated both Akṣita and Sukṣata, or, according to
the reading of the Kauṣika Sūtra, Akṣata and Sukṣata, while
Sāyaṇa has Akṣita and Sukṣita. Bloomfield<sup>2</sup> renders ‘not
caused by cutting’ and ‘caused by cutting.’ Formerly<sup>3</sup> he
suggested ‘tumour’ or ‘boil.’ Whitney<sup>4</sup> thinks that two
varieties of Jāyānya are meant. Ludwig<sup>5</sup> reads with Sāyana
{%akṣita,%} which he renders by ‘not firmly established’ in the

{@Akṣu.@}¦ — The word occurs in two passages of the Atharvaveda<sup>1</sup>
and one of the Rigveda.<sup>2</sup> Roth<sup>3</sup> renders it by ‘net,’ while
Böhtlingk<sup>4</sup> suggests ‘axle of a car.’ Geldner<sup>5</sup> sees in it a stake
or pole used with a fishermen's net ({@Jāla@}),<sup>6</sup> the pole of a wagon,<sup>7</sup>
and the pole of a house, whether vertical or horizontal, he leaves
uncertain (see {@Vaṃśa@}).<sup>8</sup> Bloomfield<sup>9</sup> takes it as a covering
of wickerwork stretched across a beam and sloping down to
both sides — like a thatched roof, and this best explains the
epithet ‘thousand-eyed’ ({%i.e.,%} with countless holes) ascribed to
it. In the other Atharvaveda passage<sup>10</sup> he accepts the sense
‘net,’ and doubts if the word in the Rigveda is not an adjective
({%a-kṣu%}) as it is taken by Sāyaṇa. See also {@Gṛha.@}

{@Agasti.@}¦ — This form of {@Agastya's@} name occurs once in the
Atharvaveda,<sup>1</sup> where he appears as a favourite of Mitra and

<L>11<pc>1-006<k1>agastya<k2>agastya
{@Agastya.@}¦ — This is the name of a sage, of mythical character,
who plays a great part in the later literature. He was a {@Māna,@}<sup>1</sup>
and therefore is called {@Mānya@}<sup>2</sup> and son of Māna, and only once
is there a reference<sup>3</sup> to the legend prevalent in latter times that
he was a son of Mitra and Varuṇa.
<div n="P"/>His greatest feat was the reconciliation of Indra and the
Maruts after Indra had been annoyed at his proposing to give
the Maruts an offering to the exclusion of Indra. This feat is
the subject of three hymns of the Rigveda,<sup>4</sup> and is often referred
[Page1-007+ 62]
to in the Brāhmaṇas,<sup>5</sup> though the exact details and significance
of the legend are variously treated by Oldenberg,<sup>6</sup> Sieg,<sup>7</sup> Hertel,<sup>8</sup>
and von Schroeder.<sup>9</sup>
<div n="P"/>He also appears in a strange dialogue with Lopāmudrā in
the Rigveda,<sup>10</sup> which appears to show him as an ascetic who
finally yields to temptation. Von {@Schroeder@}<sup>11</sup> regards it as
a ritual drama of vegetation magic.
<div n="P"/>In another passage of the Rigveda<sup>12</sup> he appears as helping
in the Aśvins’ gift of a leg to Viśpalā. Sāyaṇa holds that be
was the Purohita of {@Khela,@} and Sieg<sup>13</sup> accepts this view, while
Pischel<sup>14</sup> thinks that Khela is a deity, Vivasvant.
<div n="P"/>Geldner<sup>15</sup> shows from the Rigveda<sup>16</sup> that Agastya, as brother
of Vasiṣṭha — both being miraculous sons of Mitra and Varuṇa
-introduces {@Vasiṣṭha@} to the {@Tṛtsus.@} There are two other
references to Agastya in the Rigveda, the one<sup>17</sup> including him
in a long list of persons, the other alluding to his sister's sons
({%nadbhyaḥ%}),<sup>18</sup> apparently {@Bandhu,@} etc. In the Atharvaveda<sup>19</sup>
he appears as connected with witchcraft, and in a long list of
sages.<sup>20</sup> In the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā<sup>21</sup> cows, with a peculiar
mark on their ears ({%viṣṭya-karṇyaḥ%}), are associated with him.

({%uddhitāḥ%}). The exact sense of these expressions is doubtful.
Zimmer<sup>4</sup> considers that the former is a parallel to the Iranian
practice of casting out the dead to be devoured by beasts, and
that the latter refers to the old who are exposed when helpless.<sup>5</sup>
Whitney<sup>6</sup> refers the latter expression to the exposure of the
dead body on a raised platform of some sort.
<div n="P"/>Burial was clearly not rare in the Rigvedic period: a whole
hymn<sup>7</sup> describes the ritual attending it. The dead man was
buried apparently in full attire, with his bow in his hand, and
probably at one time his wife was immolated to accompany
him, in accordance with a practice common among savage
tribes. But in the Vedic period both customs appear in a
modified form: the son takes the bow from the hand of the
dead man, and the widow is led away from her dead husband
by his brother or other nearest kinsman. A stone is set
between the dead and the living to separate them. In the
Atharvaveda,<sup>8</sup> but not in the Rigveda, a coffin ({%vṛkṣa%}) is alluded
to. In both Saṃhitās<sup>9</sup> occur other allusions to the ‘house
of earth’ ({%bhūmi-gṛha%}). To remove the apparent discrepancy
between burning and burial, by assuming that the references to
burial are to the burial of the burned bones, as does Oldenberg,<sup>10</sup>
is unnecessary and improbable, as burning and burial subsisted
side by side in Greece for many years.
<div n="P"/>Burning was, however, equally usual, and it grew steadily
in frequency, for in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad<sup>11</sup> the adornment
[Page1-009+ 56]
of the body of the dead with curd ({@Āmikṣā@}), clothes, and
ornaments, in order to win the next world, is referred to as
something erroneous and wrong, and in the funeral Mantras of
the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>12</sup> only burning seems to be contemplated;
the verses which refer to burial here really alluding to the burial
of the ashes in the burying-ground ({%śmaśāna%}).<sup>13</sup> The body was
wrapped in fat,<sup>14</sup> as we learn from the funeral hymn in the
Rigveda, a goat being apparently burned with it,<sup>15</sup> to act as
a guide on the way to the next world. According to the
Atharvaveda<sup>16</sup> a draft-ox was burned presumably for the dead
to ride with in the next world. It was expected that the dead
would revive with his whole body and all his limbs ({%sarva-tanūḥ%}
{%sāṅgaḥ%}),<sup>17</sup> although it is also said<sup>18</sup> that the eye goes to the sun,
the breath to the wind, and so forth.
<div n="P"/>Before burial or burning, the corpse was washed,<sup>19</sup> a clog
({%kūdī%}) being tied to the foot to prevent the deceased returning
to earth.<sup>20</sup>

{@Atithi-gva.@}¦ — This name occurs frequently in the Rigveda,
apparently applying, in nearly all cases, to the same king,
otherwise called {@Divodāsa.@} The identity of the two persons
has been denied by Bergaigne,<sup>1</sup> but is certainly proved by a
number of passages, when the two names occur together,<sup>2</sup> in
connection with the defeat of {@Śambara.@} In other passages<sup>3</sup>
Atithigva is said to have assisted Indra in slaying Parṇaya and
Karañja. Sometimes he is only vaguely referred to, while once<sup>5</sup> he
is mentioned as an enemy of Turvaśa and Yadu. Again<sup>6</sup> Atithigva
is coupled with {@Āyu@} and {@Kutsa@} as defeated by {@Tūrvayāṇa.@}
<div n="P"/>A different Atithigva appears to be referred to in a Dānastuti<sup>7</sup>
(‘Praise of Gifts’), where his son, {@Indrota,@} is mentioned.
<div n="P"/>Roth<sup>8</sup> distinguishes three Atithigvas — the Atithigva Divodāsa,
the enemy of Parṇaya and Karañja, and the enemy of Tūrvayāṇa.
But the various passages can be reconciled, especially if it is
admitted that Atithigva Divodāsa was already an ancient hero
in the earliest hymns, and was becoming almost mythical.

according to Bloomfield,<sup>4</sup> to denote the two elements which
make up the Atharvaveda. The former part refers to the aus-
picious practices of the Veda ({%bheṣajāni%});<sup>5</sup> the latter to its hostile
witchcraft, the {%yātu%}<sup>6</sup> or {%abhi-cāra.%}<sup>7</sup> This theory is supported by
the names of the two mythic personages {@Ghora Āṅgirasa@} and
{@Bhiṣaj Ātharvaṇa,@} as well as by the connection of Atharvāṇaḥ
and {@Ātharvaṇāni@} with healing ({%bheṣaja%}) in the Pañcaviṃśa
Brāhmaṇa.<sup>8</sup> Moreover, the term {%bhesajā%} (‘remedies’) designates
in the Atharvaveda<sup>9</sup> that Veda itself, while in the Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa<sup>10</sup> {%yātu%} (‘sorcery’) conveys the same meaning. The
evidence, however, being by no means convincing, it remains
probable that there existed no clear differentiation between the
two sages as responsible for the Atharvaveda as a whole.

{@Adhi-ṣavaṇa.@}¦ — The two Adhiṣavaṇas<sup>1</sup> are usually understood,
as by Roth<sup>2</sup> and Zimmer,<sup>3</sup> to designate the two boards between
which the Soma was pressed. Hillebrandt,<sup>4</sup> however, shows
from the ritual that the boards were not placed one over the
other, but were placed one behind the other, the two serving
as a foundation upon which the Soma was pressed by a stone.
This theory seems to account best for the etymological sense
of the name ‘over-press,’ as well as for the use of the word as
an adjective (‘used for pressing {%upon%}’). But according to the
procedure as witnessed by Haug<sup>5</sup> in the Deccan, the shoots of
the plant are first placed on the skin, one of the boards being
then laid over them and pounded with a stone. The shoots
are then taken out and placed upon the board, the second
board being then laid over them.

{@Anu, Ānava.@}¦ — Grassmann and Roth<sup>1</sup> see in these words
designations of people foreign to the Aryans. But it is clear<sup>2</sup>
that they denote a special people, the Anus, who are mentioned
with the {@Yadus, Turvaśas, Druhyus,@} and {@Pūrus,@}<sup>3</sup> with the
Druhyus,<sup>4</sup> and with the Turvaśas, Yadus, and Druhyus.<sup>5</sup> It
is also a fair conclusion from their mention in a passage of the
Rigveda<sup>6</sup> that they dwelt on the Paruṣṇī. The inference that
the Bhṛgus were connected with this tribe is much more
doubtful,<sup>7</sup> for it rests solely on the fact that in one place<sup>8</sup> the
Bhṛgus and Druhyus are mentioned together, and not Anus and
Druhyus. Ānava is used as an epithet of Agni,<sup>9</sup> but also in the
sense of ‘Anu prince,’<sup>10</sup> in one case in conjunction with Turvaśa.<sup>11</sup>

proofs for the western position of Abhyāvartin's people in
Arachosia, in Iran. But Zimmer<sup>7</sup> is probably right in holding
that the name Pārthava merely means ‘a descendant of Pṛthu,’
and that its similarity to the Iranian Parthians is only on a par
with the numerous other points of identity between the Indian
and Iranian cultures.

{@Ayas.@}¦ — The exact metal denoted by this word when used by
itself, as always in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> is uncertain. As favouring the
sense of ‘bronze’ rather than that of ‘iron’ may perhaps be
cited with Zimmer<sup>2</sup> the fact that Agni is called {%ayo-daṃṣṭra,%}
‘with teeth of Ayas,’<sup>3</sup> with reference to the colour of his flames,
and that the car-seat of Mitra and Varuṇa is called {%ayaḥ-sthūṇa,%}<sup>4</sup>
‘with pillars of Ayas’ at the setting of the sun.<sup>5</sup> Moreover,
in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā,<sup>6</sup> Ayas is enumerated in a list of six
metals: gold ({%hiraṇya%}), Ayas, Śyāma, Loha, lead ({%sīsa%}), tin
({%trapu%}). Here {%śyāma%} (‘swarthy’) and {%loha%} (‘red’) must mean
‘iron’ and ‘copper’ respectively; {%ayas%} would therefore seem to
mean ‘bronze.’ In many passages in the Atharvaveda<sup>7</sup> and
[Page1-032+ 48]
other books, the Ayas is divided into two species — the {%śyāma%}
(‘iron’) and the {%lohita%} (‘copper’ or ‘bronze’). In the Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa<sup>8</sup> a distinction is drawn between Ayas and {%lohāyasa,%}
which may either be a distinction between iron and copper as
understood by Eggeling,<sup>9</sup> or between copper and bronze as held
by Schrader.<sup>10</sup> In one passage of the Atharvaveda,<sup>11</sup> the sense of
iron seems certain. Possibly, too, the arrow of the Rigveda,<sup>12</sup>
which had a tip of Ayas ({%yasyā ayo mukham%}), was pointed
with iron. Copper, however, is conceivable, and bronze quite
likely.

referred to. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>14</sup> states that if ‘well
smelted’ ({%bahu-dhmātam%}) it is like gold, referring evidently to
bronze. A heater of Ayas is mentioned in the Vājasaneyi

{@Arya.@}¦ — This word is not common in the older literature, in
places where the quantity of the first vowel is fixed as short, except
in a mere adjectival sense. Geldner,<sup>1</sup> indeed, contends that no
other sense is anywhere needed; but Roth<sup>2</sup> and Zimmer<sup>3</sup> agree
in thinking that in several passages of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>4</sup>
the word has the same sense as {@Ārya,@} and this appears probable.
Whether it is necessary to ascribe this sense to the word in the
compound {%arya-patnī%}<sup>5</sup> applied to the waters set free by Indra,
is more doubtful. The commentator, Mahīdhara,<sup>6</sup> suggests
that the word means a {@Vaiśya,@} not an {@Ārya@} generally. This
view is supported by the explanation in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>7</sup>
of one of the passages of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā.<sup>8</sup> But though
the use of Arya to denote a Vaiśya became common later, it is
not clear that it was original.

hundred rams, and in a Dānastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’)<sup>6</sup> a hundred
sheep are mentioned as a gift. The ({%meṣa,%}<sup>7</sup> {%vṛṣṇi%}<sup>8</sup> ) ram was
sometimes castrated ({%petva%}).<sup>9</sup> The main use of sheep was their
wool; hence the expression ‘woolly’ ({%ūrṇāvatī%})<sup>10</sup> is employed to
designate a sheep. In the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>11</sup> the ram is
described as ‘woolly,’ and as ‘the skin of beasts, quadruped and
biped,’ with reference to the use of its wool as clothing for men
and shelter for animals. Pūṣan is said<sup>12</sup> to weave raiment from
the wool of sheep. Normally the sheep stayed out at pasture;
in an obscure passage of the Rigveda<sup>13</sup> reference appears to be
made to rams in stall. Gandhāra<sup>14</sup> ewes were famous for their
wool. Pischel<sup>15</sup> considers that the {@Paruṣṇī@}<sup>16</sup> was named from

{@Aśva@}¦ is the commonest word for ‘horse’ in the Vedic
literature. The horse is also called ‘the runner’ ({%atya%}), ‘the
swift’ ({%arvant%}), ‘the strong,’ for pulling ({%vājin%}), ‘the runner’
({%sapti%}), and ‘the speeding’ ({%haya%}). The mare is termed {%aśvā,%}
{%atyā, arvatī, vaḍavā,%} etc. Horses of various colour were known,
dun ({%harita, hari%}), ruddy ({%aruṇa, aruṣa, piśaṅga, rohita%}), dark
brown ({%śyāva%}), white ({%śveta%}), etc. A white horse with black
ears is mentioned in the Atharvaveda as of special value.<sup>1</sup>
Horses were highly prized,<sup>2</sup> and were not rare, as Roth<sup>3</sup>
thought, for as many as four hundred mares are mentioned in
one Dānastuti (‘Praise of Gifts’).<sup>4</sup> They were on occasion
ornamented with pearls and gold.<sup>5</sup>

swiftness and sureness.<sup>6</sup> They were also used for drawing
carts, but were not ordinarily so employed.<sup>7</sup> No mention is
made of riding in battle, but for other purposes it was not
unknown.<sup>8</sup>
<div n="P"/>Horses were often kept in stalls,<sup>9</sup> and fed there.<sup>10</sup> But they
were also allowed to go out to grass,<sup>11</sup> and were then hobbled.<sup>12</sup>
They were watered to cool them after racing.<sup>13</sup> Their attendants

{@Aṣṭa-karṇī@}¦ is an expression which occurs in one passage of
the Ṛigveda,<sup>1</sup> and which Roth<sup>2</sup> was at first inclined to interpret
[Page1-046+ 46]
as a proper name. There can, however, be no doubt that
it means a cow, not a man, as suggested by Grassmann. The
exact reason why a cow should be so described is uncertain.
Roth<sup>3</sup> was later inclined to see in it the sense ‘having pierced
ears,’ similar epithets being at a later period known to Pāṇini<sup>4</sup>
({%bhinna-karṇa, chinna-karṇa%}). Grassmann's more obvious
rendering, ‘having the sign for (the number) 8 marked on the ear,’
is supported by the similar epithets, ‘having the mark of a lute on
the ear’ ({%karkari-karṇyaḥ%}), ‘having the mark of a sickle on the ear’
({%dātra-karṇyaḥ%}), ‘having the mark of a stake on the ear’ ({%sthūṇā-%}
{%karṇyaḥ%}), ‘having the ears bored’ ({%chidra-karṇyaḥ%}), and {%viṣtya-%}
{%karṇyaḥ,%} given in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā.<sup>5</sup> The simple mean-
ing, ‘with marked ears,’ is, however, supported by the same
passage of the Maitrāyaṇī, where the verb {%akṣ%} occurs in the
sense ‘to mark.’ In the Atharvaveda the mark used is the
Mithuna, no doubt as a magical device to secure fertility.
<div n="P"/>The marking of ears was apparently a regular practice. It is
twice referred to in the Atharvaveda.<sup>6</sup> The mark is termed
{%lakṣman,%}<sup>7</sup> and was made with a copper-knife<sup>8</sup> ({%lohita%}). The
Maitrayaṇī Saṃhitā<sup>9</sup> forbids the use of an arrow-shaft ({%tejana%}),
or of iron, but permits that of a stem of sugar-cane ({%ikṣu-kāṇḍa%})
or copper.

<L>200<pc>1-048<k1>ahan<k2>ahan
{@Ahan,@}¦ ‘day.’ Like other peoples, the Indians used night
as a general expression of time as well as day, but by no means
predominantly.<sup>1</sup> Night is also termed the dark ({%kṛṣṇa%}), as
[Page1-049+ 56]
opposed to the light ({%arjuna%}), day.<sup>2</sup> Aho-rātra<sup>3</sup> is a regular
term for ‘day and night’ combined.
<div n="P"/>The day itself is variously divided. In the Atharvaveda<sup>4</sup>
a division into ‘the rising sun’ ({%udyan sūryaḥ%}), ‘the coming
together of the cows’ ({%saṃ-gava%}), ‘midday’ ({%madhyaṃ-dina%}),
‘afternoon’ ({%aparāhṇa%}), and ‘sunset’ ({%astaṃ-yan%}) is found.
In the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>5</sup> the same series appears with
‘early’ ({%prātar%}) and ‘evening’ ({%sāyāhna%}) substituted for the
first and last members, while a shorter list gives {%prātar,%}
{%saṃgava, sāyam.%} In the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā<sup>6</sup> there is the
series ‘dawn’ {%(uṣas), saṃgava, madhyaṃdina,%} and {%aparāhṇa.%}
<div n="P"/>The morning is also, according to Zimmer, called {%api-śarvara,%}<sup>7</sup>
as the time when the dark is just past. It is named {%svasara,%}<sup>8</sup>
as the time when the cows are feeding, before the first milking
at the {%saṃgava,%} or when the birds are awakening.<sup>9</sup> It is also
called {%pra-pitva,%}<sup>10</sup> according to Zimmer.<sup>11</sup> But Geldner<sup>12</sup> points
out that that term refers to the late midday, which also is
called {%api-śarvara,%} as bordering on the coming night, being the
time when day is hastening to its close, as in a race. From
another point of view, evening is called {%abhi-pitva,%}<sup>13</sup> the time
when all come to rest. Or again, morning and evening are
denoted as the dawning of the sun ({%uditā sūryasya%}), or its
setting ({%ni-mruc%}). The midday is regularly {%madhyam ahnām,%}<sup>14</sup>
{%madhye,%}<sup>15</sup> or {%madhyaṃdina. Saṃgava%}<sup>16</sup> is the forenoon, between
the early morning ({%prātar%}) and midday ({%madhyaṃdina%}).
<div n="P"/>The divisions of time less than the day are seldom precisely
given. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>17</sup> however, a day and
[Page1-050+ 48]
night make up 30 {%muhūrtas;%} 1 {%muhūrta%} = 15 {%kṣipra;%} 1 {%kṣipra%} =
15 {%etarhi;%} 1 {%etarhi%} = 15 {%idāni;%} 1 {%idāni%} = 15 breathings; 1 breath-
ing = 1 spiration; 1 spiration = 1 twinkling ({%nimeṣa%}), etc. In
the Sāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka<sup>18</sup> the series is {%dhvaṃsayo, nimeṣāḥ,%}
{%kāṣṭhāḥ, kalāḥ, kṣanā, muhūrtā, ahorātrāḥ.%} A thirtyfold division
of day as well as of night is seen in one passage of the
Rigveda<sup>19</sup> by Zimmer, who compares the Babylonian sixty-
fold division of the day and night. But the expression used — 
thirty Yojanas — is too vague and obscure — Bergaigne<sup>20</sup> refers
it to the firmament — to build any theory upon with safety.
<div n="P"/>The longer divisions of time are regularly ‘half month’
({%ardha-māsa%}), ‘month’ ({%māsa%}), ‘season’ ({%ṛtu%}), and ‘year’
({%saṃvatsara%}), which often<sup>21</sup> occur in this sequence after
{%ahorātrāṇi%} (‘days and nights’).

a mythical horse, Paidva, which the Aśvins gave to Pedu as
a protection against snakes,<sup>8</sup> and which is invoked as a
destroyer of serpents.<sup>9</sup> The ichneumon ({%nakula%}) is regarded

from the Atharvaveda<sup>5</sup> to have been a quasi-circular one to
a mark ({%kārṣman%}<sup>6</sup> ) and back again. In the Rigveda the
course is described as broad ({%urvī%}) and the distance as
measured out ({%apāvṛktā aratnayaḥ%}).<sup>7</sup> Prizes ({%dhana%}) were
offered ({%dhā%}),<sup>8</sup> and eagerly competed for. Other words for

a horse-chariot race in the Mudgala hymn in the Rigveda,

sound. Pischel<sup>20</sup> also seeks to show that races were run in

{@Ā-yudha,@}¦ ‘weapon,’ in its widest sense covers the whole
of a Kṣatriya's warlike equipment, which in the Aitareya
Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> is summed up as horse-chariot ({%aśva-ratha%}), bow
and arrows ({%iṣu-dhanva%}), and corselet ({%kavaca%}). As the bow and
arrow ({%iṣu, dhanvan%}) were essential as the main weapons of
the Vedic fighter, they are probably meant when Āyudha is
used specifically of weapons, as often from the Rigveda<sup>2</sup>
onwards. The battle hymn in the Rigveda<sup>3</sup> confirms this
view, as it presents to us the warrior armed with bow and
arrow on his chariot, and clad in armour ({@Varman@}), with a
guard ({@Hastaghna@}) on the left arm to avoid the friction of the
bow-string. The corselet was not a single solid piece of metal,
but consisted of many pieces fitted together ({%syūta%});<sup>4</sup> it may
[Page1-061+ 41]
have been made either of metal plates or, as is more likely, of
some stiff material plated with metal. In addition the warrior
wore a helmet ({@Śiprā@}). There is no trace of the use of a
shield, nor is there any clear record of the employment of
greaves or other guard for the feet.<sup>5</sup> Skill in the use of weapons
is referred to in the Rigveda.<sup>6</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is doubtful whether sling stones ({@Adri, Aśani@}) were in
ordinary use. The hook ({%aṅkuśa%})<sup>7</sup> also is merely a divine
weapon, and the axe ({%svadhiti,%}<sup>8</sup> {%vāśī, paraśu%}) does not occur in
mortal combats. For the use of the spear see {@Ṛṣṭi, Rambhiṇī,@}

{@Ārjīka@}¦<sup>1</sup> and {@Ārjīkīya@}<sup>2</sup> (masc.), {@Ārjīkīyā@}<sup>3</sup> (fem.). — The two
masculine forms probably denote the people or land, while the
feminine word designates the river of the land. Hillebrandt<sup>4</sup>
locates the country in or near Kaśmir, as Arrian<sup>5</sup> mentions
Arsaces, brother of Abhisares, who presumably took his name
from his people, and Abhisāra bordered on Kaśmir. Pischel<sup>6</sup>
accepts Ārjīka as designating a country, which he, however,
thinks cannot be identified. But neither Roth<sup>7</sup> nor Zimmer<sup>8</sup>
recognizes the word as a proper name. On the other hand,
all authorities agree in regarding Ārjīkīyā as the name of a
[Page1-063+ 38]
river. {@Roth@}<sup>9</sup> does so in one passage<sup>10</sup> only, elsewhere seeing
references to Soma vessels; but it seems necessary to treat the
word alike in all passages containing it. Zimmer does not
locate the river, and Pischel denies the possibility of its
identification. Hillebrandt thinks it may have been the
Upper Indus, or the {@Vitastā@} (the Jhelum), or some other
stream. Grassmann follows Yāska<sup>11</sup> in identifying it with the
the {@Vipāś@} (Beäs), but this is rendered improbable by the
position of the name in the hymn in praise of rivers ({%nadī-%}

of the Arghanab.

<L>265<pc>1-064<k1>Arya<k2>Arya
{@Ārya@}¦ is the normal designation in the Vedic literature from
the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> onwards of an Āryan, a member of the three
upper classes, {@Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya,@} or {@Vaiśya,@} as the formal
division is given in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>2</sup> The Ārya
stands in opposition to the {@Dāsa,@}<sup>3</sup> but also to the {@Śūdra.@}
Sometimes<sup>4</sup> the expression is restricted to the Vaiśya caste,
[Page1-065+ 56]
the Brāhmaṇa and the Kṣatriya receiving special designations;
but this use is not common, and it is often uncertain also
whether {@Arya@} is not meant. The phrase Śūdrāryau<sup>5</sup> is espe-
cially ambiguous, but appears to have denoted originally the
Śūdra and the Āryan, for in the Mahāvrata ceremony the fight
between a Śūdra and an Ārya is represented in the Taittirīya
Brāhmaṇa as one between a Brāhmaṇa and a Śūdra, though
the Sūtra treats it as a fight between a Vaiśya and a Śūdra.
<div n="P"/>The word Ārya (fem. Āryā or Ārī) also occurs frequently
used as an adjective to describe the Āryan classes ({%viśaḥ%}),<sup>6</sup> or
name ({%nāman%}),<sup>7</sup> or caste ({%varṇa%}),<sup>8</sup> or dwellings ({%dhāman%});<sup>9</sup> or
again reference is made to the Āryan supremacy ({%vrata%})<sup>10</sup> being
extended over the land. Āryan foes ({%vṛtra%})<sup>11</sup> are referred to
beside Dāsa foes, and there are many<sup>12</sup> references to war
of Āryan versus Āryan, as well as to war of Āryan against
Dāsa. From this it can be fairly deduced that even by the
time of the Rigveda the Āryan communities had advanced
far beyond the stage of simple conquest of the aborigines. In
the later Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas the wars alluded to seem
mainly Āryan wars, no doubt in consequence of the fusion of
Ārya and Dāsa into one community.
<div n="P"/>Weber<sup>13</sup> considers that the five peoples known to the Rigveda
were the Āryans and the four peoples of the quarters ({%diś%})
of the earth, but this is doubtful. Āryan speech ({%vāc%})<sup>14</sup>
is specially referred to in the Aitareya and Śāṅkhāyana
Āraṇyakas.

Śūdrāryau is found. Lanman, in
Whitney's Translation of the Athar-
vaveda, 948, 1003, quotes his view with
approval; but Whitney's version leaves
no doubt that he read and understood
the text as Ārya, the Āryan, not the
Vaiśya. For Whitney's view, Av. iv. 20,
4. 8 may be cited; and so Roth, St.
Petersburg Dictionary, {%s.v.,%} takes the
passages. In Taittirīya Saṃhitā, iv. 3,

denoting the stages of a Hindu's life is found in the Śvetāśvatara
Upaniṣad.<sup>1</sup> In one passage<sup>2</sup> of the Chāndogya Upaniṣad
reference is made only to the {@Brahmacārin@} and householder, to
whom, as a reward for study, the procreation of children, the
practice of Yoga, abstention from injury to living creatures,
and sacrifices, freedom from transmigration are promised. In
another place<sup>3</sup> three states are contemplated, but not as con-
secutive. The Brahmacārin may either become a householder
or become an anchorite, or remain in his teacher's house all his
life. Similarly, reference<sup>4</sup> is made to the death of the anchorite
in the forest, or the sacrifice in the village. In contrast with all
three<sup>5</sup> is the man who stands fast in Brahman (Brahma-
saṃstha). In the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad<sup>6</sup> the knower of the
Ātman is contrasted with those who (1) study, or (2) sacrifice
and give alms, or (3) are anchorites, and in another place<sup>7</sup> with
those who sacrifice and make benefactions, and those who
practice asceticism. This position of superiority to, and

{@Ā-sandī.@}¦ — This is a generic term for a seat of some sort,
occurring frequently in the later Saṃhitās<sup>1</sup> and Brāhmaṇas.<sup>2</sup>
but not in the Rigveda. In the Atharvaveda<sup>3</sup> the settle brought
for the {@Vrātya@} is described at length. It had two feet, lengths
wise and cross-pieces, forward and cross-cords, showing that it
was made of wood and also cording. It was also covered with
a cushion ({@Āstaraṇa@}) and a pillow ({@Upabarhaṇa@}), had a seat
({@Āsāda@}) and a support ({@Upaśraya@}). Similar seats are described
in the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad<sup>4</sup> and the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>5</sup>
The seat for the king at the royal consecration is described in
very similar terms in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>6</sup> where the
height of the feet is placed at a span, and the lengthwise and
cross-pieces are each to be a cubit, while the interwoven part
({%vivayana%}) is to be of Muñja grass, and the seat of Udumbara
wood. In another passage of the Atharvaveda<sup>7</sup> Lanman
seems to take the seat meant as a ‘long reclining chair.’ There
also a cushion ({@Upadhāna@}) and coverlet ({@Upavāsana@}) are
mentioned. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa repeatedly describes
the Āsandī in terms showing that it was an elaborate seat. In
one place<sup>8</sup> it is said to be made of Khadira wood, perforated
({%vi-tṛṇṇā%}), and joined with straps ({%vardhra-yutā%}) like that of the
Bhāratas. At the Sautrāmaṇī rite<sup>9</sup> (an Indra sacrifice) the
seat is of Udumbara wood, is knee-high, and of unlimited
width and depth, and is covered with plaited reed-work. The
[Page1-072+ 40]
imperial seat<sup>10</sup> is to be shoulder-high, of Udumbara wood, and
wound all over with cords of Balvaja grass ({%Eleusina indica%}).
Elsewhere<sup>11</sup> the seat is a span high, a cubit in width and
depth, of Udumbara wood, and covered with reed-grass cords,
and daubed with clay.

to; in either case he seems to be regarded as an ancient hero.

along with {@Purāṇa@} in the later texts of the Vedic period.
The earliest reference to both occurs in the late fifteenth book
of the Atharvaveda.<sup>1</sup> Itihāsa then appears in the Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa,<sup>2</sup> the Jaiminīya,<sup>3</sup> Bṛhadāraṇyaka,<sup>4</sup> and Chāndogya
Upaniṣads.<sup>5</sup> In the latter it is expressly declared with Purāṇa
to make up the fifth Veda, while the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra<sup>6</sup>
makes the Itihāsa a Veda and the Purāṇa a Veda. The
Itihāsa-veda and the Purāṇa-veda appear also in the Gopatha
Brāhmaṇa,<sup>7</sup> while the Śatapatha<sup>8</sup> identifies the Itihāsa as well
as the Purāṇa with the Veda. In one passage {@Anvākhyāna@}
and Itihāsa are distinguished<sup>9</sup> as different classes of works, but
the exact point of distinction is obscure; probably the former
was supplementary. The Taittirīya Āraṇyaka<sup>10</sup> mentions
Itihāsas and Purāṇas in the plural.
<div n="P"/>There is nothing to show in the older literature what dis-
tinction there was, if any, between Itihāsa and Purāṇa; and
the late literature,<sup>11</sup> which has been elaborately examined by
Sieg,<sup>12</sup> yields no consistent result. Geldner<sup>13</sup> has conjectured
that there existed a single work, the Itihāsa-purāṇa, a collection
[Page1-077+ 51]
of the old legends of all sorts, heroic, cosmogonic, genealogical;
but though a work called Itihāsa, and another called Purāṇa,
were probably known to Patañjali,<sup>14</sup> the inaccuracy of Geldner's
view is proved by the fact that Yāska shows no sign of having
known any such work. To him the Itihāsa may be a part of
the Mantra literature itself,<sup>15</sup> Aitihāsikas being merely people
who interpret the Rigveda by seeing in it legends where others
see myths.<sup>16</sup> The fact, however, that the use of the compound
form is rare, and that Yāska regularly has Itihāsa,<sup>17</sup> not
Itihāsa-purāṇa, is against the theory of there ever having been
one work.
<div n="P"/>The relation of Itihāsa to {@Ākhyāna@} is also uncertain. Sieg<sup>18</sup>
considers that the words Itihāsa and Purāṇa referred to the
great body of mythology, legendary history, and cosmogonic
legend available to the Vedic poets, and roughly classed as a
fifth Veda, though not definitely and finally fixed. Thus,
Anvākhyānas, {@Anuvyākhyānas,@} and {@Vyākhyānas@} could arise,
and separate Ākhyānas could still exist outside the cycle,
while an Ākhyāna could also be a part of the Itihāsa-purāṇa.
He also suggests that the word Ākhyāna has special reference
to the form of the narrative. Oldenberg,<sup>19</sup> following Windisch,<sup>20</sup>
and followed by Geldner,<sup>21</sup> Sieg, and others, has found in the
Ākhyāna form a mixture of prose and verse, alternating as
the narrative was concerned with the mere accessory parts of
the tale, or with the chief points, at which the poetic form
was naturally produced to correspond with the stress of the
emotion. This theory has been severely criticized by Hertel<sup>22</sup>
and von Schroeder.<sup>23</sup> These scholars, in accordance with
older suggestions of Max Müller<sup>24</sup> and Lévi,<sup>25</sup> see in the
[Page1-078+ 34]
so-called Ākhyāna hymns of the Rigveda, in which Oldenberg
finds actual specimens of the supposed literary genus, though
the prose has been lost, actual remains of ritual dramas.
Elsewhere<sup>26</sup> it has been suggested that the hymns in question
are merely literary dialogues.

pretation. It is found only in the Saṃhitās,<sup>1</sup> and especially in
the Rigveda.<sup>2</sup> According to Roth<sup>3</sup> and Ludwig<sup>4</sup> the sense is
‘retainer,’ and Zimmer<sup>5</sup> thinks that it includes not only
dependants and servants, but also the royal family and the
youthful cadets of the chief families. In the opinion of Pischel
and Geldner<sup>6</sup> it denotes ‘elephant.’ This view is supported
by the authority of the commentators Sāyaṇa<sup>7</sup> and Mahīdhara;<sup>8</sup>
the Nirukta,<sup>9</sup> too, gives ‘elephant’ as one of the senses of the
word. Megasthenes<sup>10</sup> and Nearchos<sup>11</sup> tell us that elephants
were a royal prerogative, and the derivative word {@Ibhya@} may
thus be naturally explained as denoting merely ‘rich’ (lit.,
‘possessor of elephants’).<sup>12</sup>

{@Iriṇa@}¦ (neut.) occurs not rarely in the later Saṃhitās<sup>1</sup> and
Brāhmaṇas<sup>2</sup> in the sense of ‘a cleft in the ground,’ usually
natural ({%sva-kṛta%}). The same meaning is also, as Pischel<sup>3</sup>
shows, to be ascribed to it in three passages of the Rigveda,<sup>4</sup>
in one<sup>5</sup> of which the hole is referred to as ‘made by water’
({%apā kṛtam%}). In another passage of the Rigveda<sup>6</sup> the word
refers to the place on which the dice are thrown. Hence
Pischel<sup>7</sup> concludes that the dicing-board must have been
so called because it contained holes into which the dice had
to be thrown if possible. Lüders,<sup>8</sup> however, points out that
this assumption is not necessary; the dice ({@Akṣa@}) were merely
thrown on a space dug out, which could be called {@Iriṇa,@} as
being a hole in the ground, though not a natural one. This
view is supported by the commentary of Sāyaṇa,<sup>9</sup> as well as

{@Iṣu@}¦ is the usual name for ‘arrow’ from the Rigveda<sup>1</sup>

hymn of the Rigveda,<sup>2</sup> which gives a catalogue of armour,
two kinds of arrows are distinctly referred to: the one is
poisoned ({%ālāktā%}), and has a head of horn ({%ruru-śīrṣṇī%}); the
other is copper-, bronze-, or iron-headed ({%ayo-mukham%}). Poisoned
({%digdhā%}) arrows are also referred to in the Atharvaveda.<sup>3</sup> The
arrows were feathered.<sup>4</sup> The parts of an arrow are enumerated
in the Atharvaveda<sup>5</sup> as the shaft ({%śalya%}), the feather-socket
({%parṇa-dhi%}), the point ({%śṛṅga%}), the neck of the point in which
the shaft is fixed ({%kulmala%}), and the {@Apaskambha@} and {@Apāṣṭha,@}
which are of more doubtful significance. In the Aitareya
Brāhmaṇa<sup>6</sup> the parts of an arrow are given as the point ({%anīka%}),
the {%śalya, tejana,%} and the feathers ({%parṇāni%}), where {%śalya%} and
{%tejana%} must apparently mean the upper and lower parts of the
shaft, since it is reasonable to suppose that the arrow is
described as a whole consecutively. So in the Atharvaveda<sup>7</sup>
the arrow of Kāma is described as having feathers, a shaft
[Page1-082+ 56]
({%śalya%}), and a firm fastening ({%kulmala%}).<sup>8</sup> The arrow was shot
from the ear, and so is described in the Rigveda<sup>9</sup> as ‘having

{@Uddālaka Āruṇi.@}¦ — Uddālaka, son of Aruṇa, is one of the
most prominent teachers of the Vedic period. He was a Brāh-
maṇa of the Kurupañcālas, according to the Śatapatha Brāh-
maṇa.<sup>1</sup> This statement is confirmed by the fact that he was
teacher of {@Proti Kausurubindi@} of Kauśāmbī,<sup>2</sup> and that his son
[Page1-088+ 60]
{@Svetaketu@} is found disputing among the Pañcālas.<sup>3</sup> He was a
pupil of Aruṇa, his father,<sup>4</sup> as well as of Patañcala Kāpya,<sup>5</sup> of
Madra, while he was the teacher of the famous Yājñavalkya<sup>6</sup>
Vājasaneya and of Kauṣītaki,<sup>7</sup> although the former is represented
elsewhere<sup>8</sup> as having silenced him. He overcame in argument
Prācīnayogya Śauceya,<sup>9</sup> and apparently also Bhadrasena Ājāta-
śatrava,<sup>10</sup> though the text here seems to read the name as
Āraṇi. He was a Gautama,<sup>11</sup> and is often alluded to as such.
As an authority on questions of ritual and philosophy, he is
repeatedly referred to by his patronymic name Āruṇi in the
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>12</sup> the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad,<sup>13</sup> the
Chāndogya Upaniṣad,<sup>14</sup> and occasionally in the Aitareya,<sup>15</sup> the
Kauṣītaki,<sup>16</sup> and the Ṣaḍviṃśa<sup>17</sup> Brāhmaṇas, as well as the
Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad.<sup>18</sup> In the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā he is not
mentioned, according to Geldner,<sup>19</sup> but only his father Aruṇa;
his name does not occur, according to Weber,<sup>20</sup> in the Pañca-
viṃśa Brāhmaṇa, but in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>21</sup> he is, as
Āruṇi, known as a contemporary of {@Divodāsa Bhaimaseni,@} and
in the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa<sup>22</sup> he is mentioned as
serving {@Vāsiṣṭha Caikitāneya.@} In the Taittirīya tradition he
seldom appears. There is an allusion in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>23</sup>
to Kusurubinda Auddālaki, and according to the Taittirīya
Brāhmaṇa,<sup>24</sup> Naciketas was a son of Vājaśravasa Gautama, who
[Page1-089+ 47]
is made out to be Uddālaka by Sāyaṇa.<sup>25</sup> But the episode of
Naciketas, being somewhat unreal, cannot be regarded as of
historical value in proving relationship. Aruṇa is known to the
Taittirīya Saṃhitā. A real son of Uddālaka was the famous
{@Śvetaketu,@} who is expressly reported by Āpastamba<sup>26</sup> to have
been in his time an Avara or later authority, a statement of
importance for the date of Āruṇi.

<L>363<pc>1-091<k1>upanizad<k2>upanizad
{@Upa-niṣad@}¦ in the Brāhmaṇas<sup>1</sup> normally denotes the ‘secret
sense’ of some word or text, sometimes the ‘secret rule’ of the
mendicant. But in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad<sup>2</sup> it is already
used in the plural as the designation of a class of writings, no
doubt actually existing and similar to the Upaniṣads in the
nature of their subject-matter and its treatment. Similarly
the sections of the Taittirīya Upaniṣad end with the words
{%ity upaniṣad.%} The Aitareya Āraṇyaka<sup>3</sup> commences its third
part with the title ‘The Upaniṣad of the Saṃhitā,’ and the
title occurs also in the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka.<sup>4</sup> The exact
primary sense of the expression is doubtful. The natural
derivation, adopted by Max Müller<sup>5</sup> and usual ever since,
makes the word mean firstly a session of pupils, hence secret
doctrine, and secondly the title of a work on secret doctrine.
Oldenberg,<sup>6</sup> however, traces the use of the word to the earlier
[Page1-092+ 42]
sense of ‘worship’ ({%cf. upāsana%}). Deussen<sup>7</sup> considers the
original sense to have been ‘secret word,’ next ‘secret text,’
and then ‘secret import,’ but this order of meaning is im-
probable. Hopkins<sup>8</sup> suggests that Upaniṣad denotes a sub-
sidiary treatise, but this sense does not account naturally for
the common use as ‘secret meaning,’ which is far more
frequent than any other.

<L>377<pc>1-096<k1>upasti<k2>upasti
{@Upa-sti@}¦ denotes both in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and the Atharvaveda<sup>2</sup> a
‘dependent,’ just as later in the Epic<sup>3</sup> the subordination of the
Vaiśya to the two superior castes is expressed by the verb
{%upa-sthā,%} ‘stand under,’ ‘support.’ The word also appears,
with the same sense, in the form of Sti, but only in the
Rigveda.<sup>4</sup> The exact nature of the dependence connoted by
the term is quite uncertain. Zimmer<sup>5</sup> conjectures that the
‘dependents’ were the members of defeated Aryan tribes who
became clients of the king, as among the Greeks, Romans, and
Germans, the term possibly including persons who had lost
their freedom through dicing.<sup>6</sup> The evidence of the Athar-
vaveda<sup>7</sup> shows that among the Upastis were included the
chariot-makers ({%ratha-kāra%}), the smiths ({%takṣan%}), and the
charioteers ({%sūta%}), and troop-leaders ({%grāma-ṇī%}), while the
Rigveda passages negative the possibility of the ‘subjects’ ({%sti%})
being the whole people. It is therefore fair to assume that
they were the clients proper of the king, not servile, but
attached in a special relation to him as opposed to the ordinary
population. They may well have included among them not
only the classes suggested by Zimmer, but also higher elements,
such as refugees from other clans, as well as ambitious men
who sought advancement in the royal service. Indeed, the
Sūta and the Grāmaṇī were, as such, officers of the king's house-
hold — kingmakers, not themselves kings, as they are described
in the Atharvaveda.<sup>8</sup> The use of the word in the Taittirīya
Saṃhitā,<sup>9</sup> the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>10</sup> and the Kāṭhaka,<sup>11</sup> is
purely metaphorical, as well as in the one passage of the
Rigveda in which it occurs. In the Paippalāda recension of
the Atharvaveda,<sup>12</sup> Vaiśya, Śūdra, and Ārya are referred to as
Upastis, perhaps in the general sense of ‘subject.’

passage of the Atharvaveda,<sup>7</sup> however, the epithet is applied to
a ram; but the sense here is that a marvel occurs, just as in
the Rigveda<sup>8</sup> a ram destroys a lioness. Bloomfield<sup>9</sup> suggests
in the Atharvaveda passage another reading which would mean
‘horse.’ A parallel division of animals is that of the Taittirīya<sup>10</sup>
and Vājasaneyi Saṃhitās<sup>11</sup> into ‘whole-hoofed’ ({%eka-śapha%}) and
‘small’ ({%kṣudra%}).
<div n="P"/>Zimmer<sup>12</sup> seeks to show from the Greek <lang n="greek">ἀμφώδοντα</lang><sup>13</sup> and the
Latin {%ambidens%}<sup>14</sup> that the Indo-European was familiar with
the division of the five sacrificial animals into the two classes
of man and horse on the one hand, and cattle, sheep, and
goats on the other. But this supposition is not necessary.

{@Urvarā@}¦ is with {@Kṣetra@} the regular expression, from the
Rigveda<sup>1</sup> onwards, denoting a piece of ‘ploughland’ (<lang n="greek">ἄρουρα</lang>).
Fertile ({%apnasvatī%}) fields<sup>2</sup> are spoken of as well as waste fields
({%ārtanā%}).<sup>3</sup> Intensive cultivation by means of irrigation is
clearly referred to both in the Rigveda<sup>4</sup> and in the Atharva-
veda,<sup>5</sup> while allusion is also made to the use of manure.<sup>6</sup> The
fields ({%kṣetra%}) were carefully measured according to the Rigveda.<sup>7</sup>
This fact points clearly to individual ownership in land for the
plough, a conclusion supported by the reference of Apālā, in
a hymn of the Rigveda,<sup>8</sup> to her father's field ({%urvarā%}), which
is put on the same level as his head of hair as a personal
possession. Consistent with this are the epithets ‘winning
fields’ ({%urvarā-sā, urvarā-jit, kṣetra-sā%}),<sup>9</sup> while ‘lord of fields’
used of a god<sup>10</sup> is presumably a transfer of a human epithet
({%urvarā-pati%}). Moreover, fields are spoken of in the same
[Page1-100+ 66]
connexion as children,<sup>11</sup> and the conquest of fields ({%kṣetrāṇi%}
{%saṃ-ji%}) is often referred to in the Saṃhitās.<sup>12</sup> Very probably, as
suggested by Pischel,<sup>13</sup> the ploughland was bounded by grass
land (perhaps denoted by {@Khila, Khilya@}) which in all likelihood
would be joint property on the analogy of property elsewhere.
There is no trace in Vedic literature of communal property
in the sense of ownership by a community of any sort,<sup>14</sup> nor is
there mention of communal cultivation. Individual property
in land seems also presumed later on. In the Chāndogya
Upaniṣad<sup>15</sup> the things given as examples of wealth include
fields and houses ({%āyatanāni%}). The Greek evidence<sup>16</sup> also
points to individual ownership. The precise nature of the
ownership is of course not determined by the expression
‘individual ownership.’ The legal relationship of the head
of a family and its members is nowhere explained, and can
only be conjectured (see {@Pitṛ@}). Very often a family may have
lived together with undivided shares in the land. The rules
about the inheritance of landed property do not occur before the
Sūtras.<sup>17</sup> In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>18</sup> the giving of land as
a fee to priests is mentioned, but with reproof: land was no
doubt even then a very special kind of property, not lightly to
be given away or parted with.<sup>19</sup>

of Manu's division of his property,
from which Nābhānediṣṭha was ex-
cluded, this exclusion is made good by
the son's obtaining cattle ({%paśavaḥ%}). It
is clear that cattle, not land, was the
real foundation of wealth, just as in
Ireland, Italy ({%cf. pecunia%}), Greece, etc.
Cattle could be, and were, used indi-
vidually, but land was not open to a
man's free disposal; no doubt, at any
rate, the consent of the family or the
community might be required, but we
are reduced to reliance on analogy in

garded as northerners. In the Rigveda<sup>4</sup> the people is alluded to
in one passage by reference to their queen, Uśīnarāṇī. Zimmer<sup>5</sup>
thinks that the Uśīnaras earlier lived farther to the north-west,
but for this there is no clear evidence. His theory is based
merely on the fact that the Anukramaṇī (Index) of the Rigveda
ascribes one hymn<sup>6</sup> to Śibi Auśīnara, and that the Śibis were
known to Alexander's followers as <lang n="greek">Σίβοι</lang>,<sup>7</sup> living between the
Indus and the Akesines (Chenab). But this is in no way
conclusive, as the Śibis, at any rate in Epic times,<sup>8</sup> occupied
the land to the north of Kurukṣetra, and there is no reason
whatever to show that in the Vedic period the Uśīnaras were
farther west than the ‘Middle Country.’

{@Ṛṇa,@}¦ ‘debt,’ is repeatedly mentioned from the Rigveda<sup>1</sup>
onwards, having apparently been a normal condition among
the Vedic Indians. Reference is often made<sup>2</sup> to debts con-
tracted at dicing. To pay off a debt was called {%ṛṇaṃ saṃ-nī.%}<sup>3</sup>
Allusion is made to debt contracted without intention of
payment.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>The result of non-payment of a debt might be very serious:
the dicer might fall into slavery.<sup>5</sup> Debtors, like other male-
factors, such as thieves, were frequently bound by their
creditors to posts ({%dru-pada%}),<sup>6</sup> presumably as a means of
putting pressure on them or their friends to pay up the
debt.
<div n="P"/>The amount of interest payable is impossible to make out.
In one passage of the Rigveda and Atharvaveda<sup>7</sup> an eighth
({%śapha%}) and a sixteenth ({%kalā%}) are mentioned as paid, but it is
quite uncertain whether interest or an instalment of the
principal is meant. Presumably the interest would be paid
in kind.
<div n="P"/>How far a debt was a heritable interest or obligation does
not appear. The Kauśika Sūtra<sup>8</sup> regards three hymns of the
[Page1-110+ 64]
Atharvaveda<sup>9</sup> as applicable to the occasion of the payment of
a debt after the creditor's decease. For the payment of a debt.
by a relation of the debtor the evidence is still less clear.<sup>10</sup>
<div n="P"/>Zimmer<sup>11</sup> thinks that payments of debt were made in the
presence of witnesses who could be appealed to in case of
dispute. This conclusion is, however, very uncertain, resting
solely on a vague verse in the Atharvaveda.<sup>12</sup>

{@Ṛtu,@}¦ ‘season,’ is a term repeatedly mentioned from the
Rigveda<sup>1</sup> onwards, Three seasons of the year are often
alluded to,<sup>2</sup> but the names are not usually specified. In one
passage of the Rigveda<sup>3</sup> spring ({%vasanta%}), summer ({%grīṣma%}), and
autumn ({%śarad%}) are given. The Rigveda knows also the rainy
season ({%prā-vṛṣ%}) and the winter ({%himā, hemanta%}). A more
usual<sup>4</sup> division (not found in the Rigveda) is into five seasons,
[Page1-111+ 57]
{%vasanta, grīṣma, varṣā, śarad, hemama-siśira,%} but occasionally
the five are otherwise divided, {%varṣā-śarad%} being made one
season.<sup>5</sup> Sometimes six<sup>6</sup> seasons are reckoned, {%hemanta%} and
{%śiśira%} being divided, so that the six seasons can be made
parallel to the twelve months of the year. A still more
artificial arrangement<sup>7</sup> makes the seasons seven, possibly by
reckoning the intercalary month as a season, as Weber and
Zimmer<sup>8</sup> hold, or more probably because of the predilection
for the number seven, as Roth<sup>9</sup> suggests. Occasionally the
word {%ṛtu%} is applied to the months.<sup>10</sup> The last season,
according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>11</sup> is {%hemanta.%}
<div n="P"/>The growth of the division of the seasons from three to five
is rightly explained by Zimmer<sup>12</sup> as indicating the advance of
the Vedic Indians towards the east. It is not Rigvedic, but
dominates the later Saṃhitās. Traces of an earlier division of
the year into winter and summer do not appear clearly in the
Rigveda, where the appropriate words {%himā%} and {%samā%} are
merely general appellations of the year, and where {%śarad%}<sup>13</sup> is
commoner than either as a designation of the year, because it
denotes the harvest, a time of overwhelming importance to a
young agricultural people. The division of the year in one
passage of the Atharvaveda<sup>14</sup> into two periods of six months
is merely formal, and in no way an indication of old
tradition.

{@Ṛtv-ij@}¦ is the regular term for ‘sacrificial priest,’ covering all
the different kinds of priests employed at the sacrifice. It
appears certain that all the priests were Brāhmaṇas.<sup>1</sup> The
number of priests officiating at a sacrifice with different functions
was almost certainly seven. The oldest list, occurring in one
passage of the Rigveda,<sup>2</sup> enumerates their names as Hotṛ, Potṛ,
Neṣṭṛ, Agnīdh, Praśāstṛ, Adhvaryu, Brahman, besides the
institutor of the sacrifice. The number of seven probably
explains the phrase ‘seven Hotṛs’ occurring so frequently in
the Rigveda, and is most likely connected with that of the
mythical ‘seven Ṛṣis.’ It may be compared with the eight of
Iran.<sup>3</sup> The chief of the seven priests was the Hotṛ, who was
the singer of the hymns, and in the early times their composer
also. The Adhvaryu performed the practical work of the
sacrifice, and accompanied his performance with muttered
formulas of prayer and deprecation of evil. His chief assist-
ance was derived from the Agnīdh, the two performing the
smaller sacrifices without other help in practical matters. The
Praśāstṛ, Upavaktṛ, or Maitrāvaruṇa, as he was variously
called, appeared only in the greater sacrifices as giving in-
structions to the Hotṛ, and as entrusted with certain litanies.
The Potṛ, Neṣṭṛ, and Brahman belonged to the ritual of the
Soma sacrifice, the latter being later styled Brāhmaṇāc-
chaṃsin to distinguish him from the priest who in the later
[Page1-113+ 60]
ritual acted as supervisor. Other priests referred to in the
Rigveda<sup>4</sup> are the singers of Sāmans or chants, the Udgātṛ
and his assistant the Prastotṛ, while the Pratihartṛ, another
assistant, though not mentioned, may quite well have been
known. Their functions undoubtedly represent a later stage
of the ritual, the development of the elaborate series of
sacrificial calls on the one hand, and on the other the use
of long hymns addressed to the Soma plant. Other priests,
such as the Achāvāka,<sup>5</sup> the Grāvastut, the Unnetṛ, and the
Subrahmaṇya, were known later in the developed ritual of the
Brāhmaṇas, making in all sixteen priests, who were technically
and artificially classed in four groups<sup>6</sup> Hotṛ, Maitrāvaruṇa,
Achāvāka, and Grāvastut; Udgātṛ, Prastotṛ, Pratihartṛ, and
Subrahmaṇya; Adhvaryu, Pratisthātṛ, Neṣṭṛ, and Unnetṛ;
Brahman, Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin, Agnīdhra, and Petṛ.
<div n="P"/>Apart from all these priests was the {@Purohita,@} who was
the spiritual adviser of the king in all his religious duties.
Geldner<sup>7</sup> holds that, as a rule, when the Purohita actually
took part in one of the great sacrifices he played the part of
the Brahman, in the sense of the priest who superintended the
whole conduct of the ritual. He sees evidence for this view in
a considerable number of passages of the Rigveda<sup>8</sup> and the
later literature,<sup>9</sup> where Purohita and Brahman were combined
or identified. Oldenberg,<sup>10</sup> however, more correctly points out
[Page1-114+ 49]
that in the earlier period this was not the case: the Purohita
was then normally the Hotṛ, the singer of the most important
of the songs; it was only later that the Brahman, who in the
capacity of overseer of the rite is not known to the Rigveda,
acquired the function of general supervision hitherto exercised
by the Purohita, who was {%ex officio%} skilled in the use of magic
and in guarding the king by spells which could also be applied
to guarding the sacrifice from evil demons. With this agrees
the fact that Agni, pre-eminently<sup>11</sup> the Purohita of men, is also
a Hotṛ, and that the two divine Hotṛs of the Āprī hymns are
called<sup>12</sup> the divine Purohitas. On the other hand, the rule
is explicitly recognized in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>13</sup> that a
Kṣatriya should have a Brahman as a Purohita; and in
the Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>14</sup> the Vasiṣṭha family have a special
claim to the office of Brahman-Purohita, perhaps an indi-
cation that it was they who first as Purohitas exchanged the
function of Hotṛs for that of Brahmans in the sacrificial
ritual.
<div n="P"/>The sacrifices were performed for an individual in the great
majority of cases. The Sattra,<sup>15</sup> or prolonged sacrificial session,
was, however, performed for the common benefit of the priests
taking part in it, though its advantageous results could only be
secured if all the members actually engaged were consecrated
({%dīkṣita%}). Sacrifices for a people as such were unknown. The
sacrifice for the king was, it is true, intended to bring about
the prosperity of his people also; but it is characteristic that
the prayer<sup>16</sup> for welfare includes by name only the priest and
the king, referring to the people indirectly in connexion with
the prosperity of their cattle and agriculture.
<F>1) This is assumed throughout the
Vedic texts, and is accompanied by
the rule that no Kṣatriya can eat of
the sacrificial offering ({%Cf.%} Aitareya
Brāhmaṇa, vii. 26): no doubt because
only the Brāhmaṇas were sufficiently
holy to receive the divine essence of
the sacrifice into which, by partaking
of it, the deity has entered in part.</F>

{@Ṛṣi,@}¦ ‘seer,’ is primarily a composer of hymns to the gods.
In the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> reference is often made to previous singers
and to contemporary poets. Old poems were inherited and
refurbished by members of the composer's family,<sup>2</sup> but the
great aim of the singers was to produce new and approved
hymns.<sup>3</sup> It is not till the time of the Brāhmaṇas that the
[Page1-116+ 62]
composition of hymns appears to have fallen into disuse,<sup>4</sup>
though poetry was still produced, for example, in the form of
{@Gāthās,@} which the priests were required to compose them-
selves<sup>5</sup> and sing to the accompaniment of the lute at the
sacrifice. The Ṛṣi was the most exalted of Brāhmaṇas,<sup>6</sup> and
his skill, which is often compared with that of a carpenter,<sup>7</sup>
was regarded as heaven-sent.<sup>8</sup> The Purohita, whether as Hotṛ
or as Brahman (see {@Ṛtvij@}), was a singer.<sup>9</sup> No doubt the Ṛṣis
were normally<sup>10</sup> attached to the houses of the great, the petty
kings of Vedic times, or the nobles of the royal household.
Nor need it be doubted that occasionally<sup>11</sup> the princes them-
selves essayed poetry: a Rājanyarṣi, the prototype of the later
Rājarṣi or ‘royal seer,’ who appears in the Pañcaviṃśa
Brāhmaṇa,<sup>12</sup> though he must be mythical as Oldenberg<sup>13</sup>
points out, indicates that kings cultivated poetry<sup>14</sup> just as later
they engaged in philosophic disputations.<sup>15</sup> Normally, how-
ever, the poetical function is Brahminical, Viśāmitra and others
not being kings, but merely Brāhmaṇas, in the Rigveda.
<div n="P"/>In the later literature the Ṛṣis are the poets of the hymns
preserved in the Saṃhitās. a Ṛṣi being regularly<sup>16</sup> cited when
a Vedic Saṃhitā is quoted. Moreover, the Ṛṣis become the
representatives of a sacred past, and are regarded as holy sages,
[Page1-117+ 56]
whose deeds are narrated as if they were the deeds of gods or
Asuras.<sup>17</sup> They are typified by a particular group of seven,<sup>18</sup>
mentioned four times in the Rigveda,<sup>19</sup> several times in the
later Saṃhitās,<sup>20</sup> and enumerated in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka
Upaniṣad<sup>21</sup> as Gotama, Bharadvāja, Viśvāmitra, Jamadagni,
Vasiṣṭha, Kaśyapa, and Atri. In the Rigveda itself Kutsa,<sup>22</sup>
Atri,<sup>23</sup> Rebha,<sup>24</sup> Agastya,<sup>25</sup> the Kuśikas,<sup>26</sup> Vasiṣṭha,<sup>27</sup> Vyaśva,<sup>28</sup>
and others appear as Ṛṣis; and the Atharvaveda<sup>29</sup> contains a
long list, including Aṅgiras, Agastī, Jamadagni, Atri, Kaśyapa,
Vasiṣṭha, Bharadvāja, Gaviṣṭhira, Viśvāmitra, Kutsa, Kakṣīvant,
Kaṇva, Medhātithi, Triśoka, Uśanā Kāvya, Gotama, and
Mudgala.
<div n="P"/>Competition among the bards appears to have been known.
This is one of the sides of the riddle poetry ({@Brahmodya@}) that
forms a distinctive feature<sup>30</sup> of the Vedic ritual of the Aśva-
medha, or horse sacrifice. In the Upaniṣad period such
competitions were quite frequent. The most famous was that
of Yājñavalkya, which was held at the court of Janaka of
Videha, as detailed in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad,<sup>31</sup> and
which was a source of annoyance to {@Ajātaśatru@} of {@Kāśī.@}<sup>32</sup>
According to an analogous practice, a Brāhmaṇa, like {@Uddālaka@}
{@Aruṇi,@} would go about disputing with all he came across, and
compete with them for a prize of money.<sup>33</sup>

{@Oṣadhi.@}¦ — Roughly speaking, the vegetable world is divided
in Vedic literature<sup>1</sup> between Oṣadhi or {@Vīrudh@} ‘plants’ and
{@Vana@} or {@Vṛkṣa@} ‘trees.’ Oṣadhi is employed in opposition to
Vīrudh to denote plants as possessing a healing power or some
other quality useful to men, while Vīrudh is rather a generic
term for minor vegetable growths, but sometimes,<sup>2</sup> when occur-
ring beside Oṣadhi, signifies those plants which do not possess
medicinal properties.
<div n="P"/>A list of the minor parts of which a plant is made up is given
in the later Saṃhitās.<sup>3</sup> It comprises the root ({%mūla%}), the
panicle ({%tūla%}), the stem ({%kāṇḍa%}), the twig ({%valśa%}), the flower
({%puṣpa%}), and the fruit ({%phala%}), while trees<sup>4</sup> have, in addition, a
corona ({%skandha%}), branches ({%śākhā%}), and leaves ({%parṇa%}). The
Atharvaveda<sup>5</sup> gives an elaborate, though not very intelligible,
division of plants into those which expand ({%pra-stṛṇatīḥ%}), are
bushy ({%stambinīḥ%}), have only one sheath ({%eka-śuṅgāḥ%}), are
creepers ({%pra-tanvatīḥ%}), have many stalks ({%aṃśumatīḥ%}), are
[Page1-126+ 35]
jointed ({%kāṇḍinīḥ%}), or have spreading branches ({%vi-śākhāḥ%}). In
the Rigveda<sup>6</sup> plants are termed ‘fruitful’ ({%phalinīḥ%}), ‘blossom-
ing’ ({%puṣpavatīḥ%}), and ‘having flowers’ ({%pra-sūvarīḥ%}).

he is a teacher of bygone days.<sup>11</sup>

him the authorship of several hymns of the Rigveda, including
two (x. 32. 33) that deal with a prince {@Kuruśravaṇa@} and his
descendant {@Upamaśravas.@} There seems no reason to doubt
this attribution, which is accepted by both Zimmer<sup>2</sup> and
Geldner.<sup>3</sup> The former holds that Kavaṣa was the Purohita of
the joint tribes named {@Vaikarṇa,@} in whom he sees the Kuru-
Krivi (Pañcāla) peoples, and that Kavaṣa in that capacity is
mentioned in the Rigveda as representative of those peoples.
He also suggests that the language of Rigveda x. 33, 4 is best
explained by the reduced position in which the Kuru-Krivis
found themselves on their defeat by the Tṛtsus. Ludwig,<sup>4</sup> on
the other hand, thinks that Kavaṣa was the priest of the five
peoples. Geldner<sup>5</sup> holds that Kavaṣa was the Purohita of
Kuruśravaṇa, by whose son, Upamaśravas, he was ill-treated,
and that he composed Rigveda x. 33 to deprecate the anger of
his royal master. Hopkins<sup>6</sup> thinks that he was a king.

{@Kāru,@}¦ ‘poet,’ is a word almost confined to the Rigveda.<sup>1</sup>
There is evidence that the poet was regarded as a professional
man, just as much as the physician ({@Bhiṣaj@}).<sup>2</sup> The poets, no
doubt, mainly lived at the courts of princes amid their re-
tainers,<sup>3</sup> though they would probably also sing the praises of rich
merchants. There was probably no essential connexion between
the priest and the poet. Though the priest was often a poet,
yet poetry can hardly have been restricted to the priestly caste.
Indeed, at the horse sacrifice (Aśvamedha) the Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa<sup>4</sup> expressly requires that one of the singers of pane-
gyrics should be a Rājanya, while the other was a Brāhmaṇa,
both singing verses of their own composition. The Anukra-
maṇī (Index) in several cases<sup>5</sup> attributes hymns of the Rigveda
to princes; and even though this may often be merely the
same sort of procedure<sup>6</sup> as has made Śūdraka the author of
the Mṛcchakaṭikā, or Harṣa of the Ratnāvalī, and has given
us royal teachers of the Brahman doctrine,<sup>7</sup> still the Indian
tradition evidently saw nothing odd in the idea of non-
Brāhmaṇas as poets. Most of the non-sacred poetry has,

a Kāśi or a Videha king. The Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra<sup>6</sup>
[Page1-154+ 49]
mentions one Purohita as acting for the kings of Kāśi, Kosala,
and Videha; and the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra<sup>7</sup> mentions Kāśi
and Videha in close proximity. Weber,<sup>8</sup> indeed, throws out
the suggestion that the Kāśis and the Videhas together con-
stitute the {@Uśīnaras,@} whose name is very rare in Vedic
literature.
<div n="P"/>As Kosala and Videha were in close connexion, Kāśi and
Kosala are found combined in the compound name Kāśi-
Kauśalyas of the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>9</sup>
<div n="P"/>Though Kāśi is a late word, it is quite possible that the town
is older, as the river {@Varaṇāvatī@} referred to in the Athar-
vaveda<sup>10</sup> may be connected with the later Vārāṇasī (Benares).
<div n="P"/>It is significant that while the Kāśis, Kosalas, and Videhas
were united, any relations which the Kuru-Pañcala peoples
may have had with them were hostile. It is a fair conclusion
that between these two great groups of peoples there did exist
some political conflict as well as probably a difference of culture
in some degree. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>11</sup> in the story of the
advance of Āryan civilization over Kosala and Videha, preserves
a clear tradition of this time, and a piece of evidence that in
the Kuru-Pañcāla country lay the real centre of the Brāhmaṇa
culture (see also {@Kuru-Pañcāla@}). That the Kosala-Videhas
were originally settlers of older date than the Kuru-Pañcālas
is reasonably obvious from their geographical position, but the
true Brāhmaṇa culture appears to have been brought to them
from the Kuru-Pañcala country. It is very probable that the
East was less Āryan than the West, and that it was less
completely reduced under Brahmin spiritual supremacy, as the
movement of Buddhism was Eastern, and the Buddhist texts<sup>12</sup>
reveal a position in which the Kṣatriyas rank above Brāhmaṇas.
With this agrees the fact that the later Vedic texts<sup>13</sup> display
[Page1-155+ 43]
towards the people of Magadha a marked antipathy, which
may be reasonably explained by that people's lack of orthodoxy,
and which may perhaps be traced as far back as the Vājasaneyi
Saṃhitā.<sup>14</sup> It is, of course, possible that the Kosala-Videhas
and Kāśis actually were merely offshoots of the tribes later
known as the Kuru-Pañcālas, and that they by reason of
distance and less complete subjugation of the aborigines lost
their Brahminical culture. This hypothesis, however, appears
less likely, though it might be supported by a literal inter-
pretation of the legend of the Aryan migration in the Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa.<sup>15</sup>

<L>645<pc>1-165<k1>kuru<k2>kuru
{@Kuru.@}¦ — The Kurus appear as by far the most important
people in the Brāhmaṇa literature. There is clear evidence
that it was in the country of the Kurus, or the allied Kuru-
Pañcālas, that the great Brāhmaṇas were composed.<sup>1</sup> The
Kurus are comparatively seldom mentioned alone, their name
being usually coupled with that of the Pañcālas on account of
the intimate connexion of the two peoples. The Kuru-Pañcālas
are often expressly referred to as a united nation.<sup>2</sup> In the land
of the Kuru-Pañcālas speech is said to have its particular
home;<sup>3</sup> the mode of sacrifice among the Kuru-Pañcālas is
proclaimed to be the best;<sup>4</sup> the Kuru-Pañcāla kings perform
the Rājasūya or royal sacrifice;<sup>5</sup> their princes march forth on
raids in the dewy season, and return in the hot season.<sup>6</sup> Later
on the Kuru-Pañcāla Brahmins are famous in the Upaniṣads.<sup>7</sup>
Weber<sup>8</sup> and Grierson<sup>9</sup> have sought to find traces in Vedic
literature of a breach between the two tribes, the latter scholar
seeing therein a confirmation of the theory that the Kurus
belonged to the later stream of immigrants into India, who
were specially Brahminical, as opposed to the Pañcālas, who
were anti-Brahminical. In support of this view, Weber refers
to the story in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>10</sup> of a dispute between
{@Vaka Dālbhya@} and {@Dhṛtarāṣṭra Vaicitravīrya,@} the former
being held to be by origin a Pañcāla, while the latter is held
[Page1-166+ 51]
to be a Kuru. But there is no trace of a quarrel between
Kurus and Pañcālas in the passage in question, which merely
preserves the record of a dispute on a ritual matter between a
priest and a prince: the same passage refers to the Naimiṣīya
sacrifice among the Kuru-Pañcālas, and emphasizes the close
connexion of the two peoples.<sup>11</sup> Secondly, Weber conjectures
in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā.<sup>12</sup> that {@Subhadrikā@} of {@Kāmpila@} was
the chief queen of the king of a tribe living in the neighbour-
hood of the clan, for whose king the horse sacrifice described
in the Saṃhitā was performed. But the interpretation of this
passage by Weber is open to grave doubt;<sup>13</sup> and in the Kāṇva
recension of the Saṃhitā<sup>14</sup> a passage used at the Rājasūya
shows that the Kuru-Pañcālas had actually one king. More-
over, there is the evidence of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>15</sup> that
the old name of the Pañcālas was {@Krivi.@} This word looks very
like a variant of Kuru, and Zimmer<sup>16</sup> plausibly conjectures that
the Kurus and Krivis formed the {@Vaikarṇa@}<sup>17</sup> of the Rigveda,
especially as both peoples are found about the Sindhu and the
Asiknī.<sup>18</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Kurus alone are chiefly mentioned in connexion with
the locality which they occupied, {@Kurukṣetra,@} We are told,
however, of a domestic priest ({@Purohita@}) in the service of both
the Kurus and the {@Sṛñjayas,@}<sup>19</sup> who must therefore at one time
have been closely connected.<sup>20</sup> In the Chāndogya Upaniṣad
reference is made to the Kurus being saved by a mare ({%aśvā%}),<sup>21</sup>
and to some disaster which befel them owing to a hailstorm.<sup>22</sup>
In the Sūtras, again, a ceremony (Vājapeya) of the Kurus is
mentioned.<sup>23</sup> There also a curse, which was pronounced on them
and led to their being driven from Kurukṣetra, is alluded to.<sup>24</sup>
[Page1-167+ 46]
This possibly adumbrates the misfortunes of the Kauravas in
the epic tradition.
<div n="P"/>In the Rigveda the Kurus do not appear under that name as
a people. But mention is made of a prince, {@Kuruśravaṇa@}
(‘Glory of the Kurus’),<sup>25</sup> and of a {@Pākasthāman Kaurayāṇa.@}<sup>26</sup>
In the Atharvaveda<sup>27</sup> there occurs as a king of the Kurus
{@Parikṣit,@} whose son, {@Janamejaya,@} is mentioned in the Śata-
patha Brāhmaṇa<sup>28</sup> as one of the great performers of the horse
sacrifice.
<div n="P"/>It is a probable conjecture of Oldenberg's<sup>29</sup> that the Kuru
people, as known later, included some of the tribes referred to
by other names in the Rigveda. Kuruśravaṇa, shown by his
name to be connected with the Kurus, is in the Rigveda called
Trāsadasyava, ‘descendant of {@Trasadasyu,@}’ who is well known
as a king of the {@Pūrus.@} Moreover, it is likely that the Tṛtsu-
{@Bharatas,@} who appear in the Rigveda as enemies of the Pūtus,
later coalesced with them to form the Kuru people.<sup>30</sup> Since the
Bharatas appear so prominently in the Brāhmaṇa texts as a
great people of the past, while the later literature ignores them
in its list of nations, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that
they became merged in some other tribe. Moreover, there is
evidence that the Bharatas occupied the territory in which the
Kurus were later found. Two of them are spoken of in a hymn
of the Rigveda<sup>31</sup> as having kindled fire on the {@Dṛṣadvatī,@} the
{@Āpayā,@} and the {@Sarasvatī@} — that is to say, in the sacred places
of the later Kurukṣetra. Similarly, the goddess Bhāratī
(‘belonging to the Bharatas’) is constantly mentioned in the
Āprī (‘propitiatory’) hymns together with Sarasvatī.<sup>32</sup> Again,
according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, one Bharata king was
victorious over the Kāśis,<sup>33</sup> and another made offerings to
Gaṅgā and Yamunā,<sup>34</sup> while raids of the Bharatas against the
{@Satvants@} are mentioned in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>35</sup> Nor is it
[Page1-168+ 60]
without importance that the Bharatas appear as a variant for
the Kuru Pañcālas in a passage of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā,<sup>36</sup>
and that in the list of the great performers of the horse sacrifice
the names of one Kuru and two Bharata princes are given
without any mention of the people over which they ruled,
while in other cases that information is specifically given.<sup>37</sup>
<div n="P"/>The territory of the Kuru-Pañcālas is declared in the Aitareya
Brāhmaṇa to be the middle country ({@Madhyadeśa@}).<sup>38</sup> A group
of the Kuru people still remained further north — the {@Uttara@}
{@Kurus@} beyond the Himālaya. It appears from a passage of
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa that the speech of the Northerners — 
that is, presumably, the Northern Kurus — and of the Kuru-
Pañcālas was similar, and regarded as specially pure.<sup>39</sup> There
seems little doubt that the Brahminical culture was developed
in the country of the Kuru-Pañcālas, and that it spread thence
east, south, and west. Traces of this are seen in the Vrātya
Stomas (sacrifices for the admission of non-Brahminical
Āryans) of the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>40</sup> and in the fact that in
the Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka it is unusual for a Brahmin to dwell
in the territory of {@Magadha.@}<sup>41</sup> The repeated mention of Kuru-
Pañcāla Brahmins is another indication of their missionary
activity.<sup>42</sup>
<div n="P"/>The geographical position of the Kuru-Pañcālas renders it
probable that they were later immigrants into India than the
{@Kosala-Videha@} or the {@Kāśis,@}<sup>43</sup> who must have been pushed
[Page1-169+ 71]
into their more eastward territories by a new wave of Āryan
settlers from the west. But there is no evidence in Vedic
literature to show in what relation of time the immigration of
the latter peoples stood to that of their neighbours on the west.
It has, however, been conjectured,<sup>44</sup> mainly on the ground of
later linguistic phenomena, which have no cogency for the
Vedic period, that the Kurus were later immigrants, who,
coming by a new route, thrust themselves between the original
Āryan tribes which were already in occupation of the country
from east to west. {%Cf.%} also {@Kṛtvan.@} For other Kuru princes

probably an error to assume that the
Bharatas were originally situated far
west of Kurukṣetra, and that the main
action of the Rigveda was confined to
the Panjab. When Vasiṣṭha celebrates
the crossing of the Vipāś and Śutudrī
(Rv. iii. 33), he probably came from
the east, as Pischel, {%Vedische Studien,%}
2, 218, points out, and not from the
west. Adopting the ordinary view,
Hopkins, {%India, Old and New,%} 52, finds
it necessary to suggest that Yamunā is
only another name in the Rv. for
the Paruṣṇī. But the necessity for
this suggestion, which is not in itself
plausible, disappears when it is realized
that the Bharatas held a territory
roughly corresponding to Kurukṣetra,
and bounded on the east by the
Yamunā. On the other hand, Hille-
brandt, {%Vedische Mythologie,%} 1, 142, 143.
places the Kurus near the Ārjīkīyā in
Kaśmīr, which puts them too far north.
So also Zimmer, {%Altindisches Leben,%} 103,
and Eggeling, {%Sacred Books of the East,%}
12, xlii. It seems probable that the
Kurus were at a very early period
widely scattered to the north of the
Himālaya, in Kurukṣetra, and about
the Sindhu and Asiknī.

Āraṇyaka<sup>6</sup> as being Khāṇḍava on the south, the Tūrghna on
the north, and the Parīṇah on the west. Roughly speaking, it
corresponded to the modern Sirhind.

{@Kula, Kula-pā.@}¦ — As an uncompounded word, Kula does not

‘home’ or ‘house of the family,’ and by metonymy the family
itself, as connected with the home. The Kula-pā (lit. ‘house
protector’), or chief of the family, is mentioned in the Rigveda<sup>2</sup>
as inferior to and attendant on the {@Vrājapati@} in war, the latter
being perhaps the leader of the village contingent of the clan.
In the Atharvaveda<sup>3</sup> a girl is ironically called Kulapā, because
she is left without a husband in the world, and has only Yama
(the god of death) for a spouse.
<div n="P"/>The use of the term Kula points clearly to a system of
individual families, each no doubt consisting of several members
under the headship of the father or eldest brother, whose Kula
the dwelling is. As distinct from {@Gotra,@} Kula seems to mean

1. {@Kuṣṭha@}¦ is the name of a plant ({%Costus speciosus%} or {%arabicus%})<sup>1</sup>
which is prominent in the Atharvaveda.<sup>2</sup> It grew especially on
the mountains, along with the Soma, on the high peaks of the
Himālaya ({%Himavant%}) where the eagles nest, and was thence
brought east to men.<sup>3</sup> Like Soma, it is said to have grown in
the third heaven under the famous {@Aśvattha@} tree, where the
gods were wont to assemble, and thence it was brought in a
golden ship.<sup>4</sup> As a remedy, it held the highest place among
herbs, being called by the auspicious names Nagha-māra and
Naghā-riṣa, and styled the offspring of Jīvala and Jīvalā, the
‘lively’ ones.<sup>5</sup> It cured headache ({%śīrṣāmaya%}), diseases of the
eyes, bodily affliction,<sup>6</sup> but especially fever — hence called ‘fever-
destroyer’ ({%takma-nāśana%}) — and consumption ({@Yakṣma@}). From
its general properties it was also named ‘all-healing’ ({%viśva-%}
{%bheṣaja%}).<sup>7</sup> Its aromatic qualities were apparently known, as it
is classed with ‘salve’ ({@Āñjana@}) and ‘nard’ ({@Nalada@}).<sup>8</sup>

{@Kṛṣi,@}¦ ‘ploughing.’ The cultivation of the soil was no doubt
known to the Indians before they separated from the Iranians,
as is indicated by the identity of the expressions {%yavaṃ kṛṣ%} and
{%sasya%} in the Rigveda with {%yao karesh%} and {%hahya%} in the Avesta,
referring to the ploughing in of the seed and to the grain
which resulted.<sup>1</sup> But it is not without significance that the
expressions for ploughing occur mainly in the first<sup>2</sup> and tenth<sup>3</sup>
books of the Rigveda, and only rarely in the so-called ‘family’
books (ii.-vii.).<sup>4</sup> In the Atharvaveda {@Pṛthī Vainya@} is credited
with the origination of ploughing,<sup>5</sup> and even in the Rigveda
the Aśvins are spoken of as concerned with the sowing of grain
by means of the plough.<sup>6</sup> In the later Saṃhitās and the
Brāhmaṇas ploughing is repeatedly referred to.<sup>7</sup>
[Page1-182+ 51]
<div n="P"/>Even in the Rigveda<sup>8</sup> there is clear proof of the importance
attached to agriculture. In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>9</sup> the
{@Vrātyas,@} Hindus without the pale of Brahminism, are de-
scribed as not cultivating the soil.
<div n="P"/>The plough land was called {@Urvarā@} or {@Kṣetra;@} manure
({@Śakan, Karīṣa@}) was used, and irrigation was practised ({@Khani-@}
{@tra@}). The plough ({@Lāṅgala, Sīra@}) was drawn by oxen, teams of
six, eight, or even twelve being employed.<sup>10</sup> The operations of
agriculture are neatly summed up in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>11</sup>
as ‘ploughing, sowing, reaping, and threshing’ ({%kṛṣantaḥ,%}
{%vapantaḥ, lunantaḥ, mṛṇantaḥ%}). The ripe grain was cut with
a sickle ({@Dātra, Sṛṇi@}), bound into bundles<sup>12</sup> ({@Parṣa@}), and beaten
out on the floor of the granary ({@Khala@}).<sup>13</sup> The grain was then
separated from the straw and refuse either by a sieve ({@Titau@})
or a winnowing fan ({@Śūrpa@}).<sup>14</sup> The winnower was called
{@Dhānyākṛt,@}<sup>15</sup> and the grain was measured in a vessel called
{@Urdara.@}<sup>16</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Rigveda leaves us in doubt as to the kind of grain
grown, for {@Yava@} is a word of doubtful signification, and {@Dhānā@}
is also vague. In the later Saṃhitās<sup>17</sup> things are different.

<div n="P"/>The seasons for agriculture are briefly summed up in a
passage of the Taittirīya Saṃhitā:<sup>19</sup> barley ripened in summer,
being no doubt sown, as in modern India, in winter; rice
[Page1-183+ 52]
ripened in autumn, being sown in the beginning of the rains;
beans and sesamum, planted at the time of the summer rains,
ripened in the winter and the cool season. There were two
harvests ({@Sasya@}) a year according to the Taittirīya Saṃhitā;<sup>20</sup>
the winter crop was ripe by the month of Caitra (March-April)
according to the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa.<sup>21</sup>
<div n="P"/>The farmer had plenty of trouble of his own: moles destroyed
the seed, birds and various kinds of reptiles ({@Upakvasa, Jabhya,@}
{@Tarda, Pataṅga@}) injured the young shoots, excessive rain or
drought might damage the crops. The Atharvaveda contains
spells to prevent these evils.<sup>22</sup>

the Āryans, when they invaded India, were already agricul-
turists, though the employment of the words referring to
ploughing mentioned under {@Kṛṣi@} indicates that not all of the
people devoted themselves equally to that occupation. Indra

appears better either to regard the coincidence of name as
accidental, or to suppose that the reference is a piece of

sister's son of {@Uccaiḥśravas,@} according to the latter authority.
His people were the {@Pañcālas,@} of whom the Keśins must there-
fore have been a branch, and who are said to have been threefold
({%tryanīka%}).<sup>5</sup> A story is told of his having a ritual dispute with
{@Ṣaṇḍika@} in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā<sup>6</sup> this appears in another
form in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>3</sup> He was a contemporary
of a fellow sage, {@Keśin Sātyakāmi,@} according to the Maitrā-
yaṇī<sup>7</sup> and Taittirīya<sup>8</sup> Saṃhitās. The Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>9</sup>
attributes to him a Sāman or chant, and the Kauṣītaki Brāh-
maṇa<sup>10</sup> tells how he was taught by a golden bird.
<div n="P"/>In view of the fact that the early literature always refers to
Dārbhya as a sage, it seems doubtful whether the commentator
is right in thinking that the Śatapatha refers to a king and
a people, when a sage alone may well be meant, while the
Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa is of no great authority. The
latter work may have assumed that the reference in the Kāṭhaka
Saṃhitā<sup>11</sup> to the Keśin people signifies kingship, but this is
hardly necessary.

{@Kraya,@}¦ ‘sale,’ is a word which does not actually occur in the
Rigveda, though the verb {%krī,%} from which this noun is derived,
is found there.<sup>1</sup> Both noun and verb are common in the later
Saṃhitās.<sup>2</sup> Sale appears to have regularly consisted in barter
in the Rigveda:<sup>3</sup> ten cows are regarded as a possible price for
an (image of) Indra to be used as a fetish, while elsewhere not
a hundred, nor a thousand, nor a myriad are considered as an
adequate price ({%śulka%}) for the purchase of Indra.<sup>4</sup> The Athar-
vaveda<sup>5</sup> mentions, as possible objects of commerce, garments
({%dūrśa%}), coverlets ({%pavasta%}), and goatskins ({%ajina%}). The haggling
of the market was already familiar in the days of the Rigveda,<sup>6</sup>
and a characteristic hymn of the Atharvaveda<sup>7</sup> is directed to
procuring success in trade. The ‘price’ was called {@Vasna,@} and
the ‘merchant’ {@Vaṇij.@} his greed being well known.<sup>8</sup>
<div n="P"/>There is little evidence of a standard of value in currency
having been adopted. When no specific mention is made of
the standard, the unit was probably the cow.<sup>9</sup> In a consider-
able number of passages of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>10</sup> and
elsewhere,<sup>11</sup> however, the expression {%hiraṇyaṃ śata-mānam%}
suggests that there must have been some standard other than
[Page1-197+ 48]
cows, though it might in all these passages be rendered as
‘gold worth a hundred cows.’ But the use of the {@Kṛṣṇala@} as a
measure of weight<sup>12</sup> suggests that the meaning is ‘gold weighing
a hundred Kṛṣṇalas,’ and this seems the more probable explana-
tion. This unit seems not to be known in the Rigveda, where
the meaning of the term {@Manā,@} which occurs once, is mysterious,
and where necklets ({@Niṣka@}) seem to have been one of the more
portable forms of wealth, like jewellery in modern India, and
may perhaps have served as a means of exchange.

importance of the Pañcālas, and the insignificance of the

probable, as Oldenberg<sup>5</sup> suggests, from the Śatapatha Brāh-

as the latter name indicates, probably other tribes also. Or, if
Hopkins' view<sup>7</sup> is accepted that Turvaśa was king of the

(ii. 17, 6; 22, 2; viii. 51, 8) he takes it

{@Kṣatriya.@}¦ — As the origin of caste, the relation of the castes,
intermarriage, and cognate matters may most conveniently be
discussed under {@Varṇa,@} this article will be confined to deter-
mining, as far as possible, the real character of the class called
Kṣatriyas, or collectively {@Kṣatra.@}
<div n="P"/>The evidence of the Jātakas<sup>1</sup> points to the word Khattiya
[Page1-203+ 47]
denoting the members of the old Āryan nobility who had led
the tribes to conquest, {@as well@} as those families of the aborigines
who had managed to maintain their princely status in spite
of the conquest. In the epic<sup>2</sup> also the term Kṣatriya seems to
include these persons, but it has probably a wider signification
than Khattiya, and would cover all the royal military vassals
and feudal chiefs, expressing, in fact, pretty much the same
as the {%barones%} of early English history. Neither in the
Jātakas<sup>3</sup> nor in the epic<sup>4</sup> is the term co-extensive with all
warriors; the army contains many besides the Kṣatriyas, who
are the leaders or officers, rather than the rank and file.
<div n="P"/>In the later Saṃhitās<sup>5</sup> and the Brāhmaṇas<sup>6</sup> the Kṣatriya
stands as a definite member of the social body, distinct from
the priest, the subject people, and the slaves, {@Brāhmaṇa,@}
{@Vaiśya,@} and {@Śūdra.@} It is significant that Rājanya is a variant
to Kṣatriya, and an earlier one. Hence it is reasonable to
suppose that the Kṣatriya and Rājanya are both of similar
origin, being princely or connected with royalty. Moreover,
the early use of Kṣatriya in the Rigveda<sup>7</sup> is exclusively con-
nected with royal authority or divine authority.
<div n="P"/>It is impossible to say exactly what persons would be in-
cluded in the term Kṣatriya. That it covered the royal house
and the various branches of the royal family may be regarded
as certain. It, no doubt, also included the nobles and their
families: this would explain the occasional opposition of
Rājanya and Kṣatriya, as in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>8</sup> where
a Rājanya asks a Kṣatriya for a place for sacrifice ({%deva-yajana%}).
Thus, when strictly applied, Kṣatriya would have a wider
denotation than Rājanya. As a rule, however, the two
expressions are identical, and both are used as evidence in
what follows. That Kṣatriya ever included the mere fighting
[Page1-204+ 72]
man has not been proved: in the Rigveda<sup>9</sup> and later<sup>10</sup> others
than Kṣatriyas regularly fought; but possibly if the nobles had
retinues as the kings had, Kṣatriya would embrace those
retainers who had military functions. The term did not apply
to all members of the royal entourage; for example, the
{@Grāmaṇī@} was usually a Vaiśya.
<div n="P"/>The connexion of the Kṣatriyas with the Brahmins was very
close. The prosperity of the two is repeatedly asserted<sup>11</sup> to
be indissolubly associated, especially in the relation of king
({@Rājan@}) and domestic priest ({@Purohita@}). Sometimes there was
feud between Kṣatriya and Brahmin.<sup>12</sup> His management of the
sacrifice then gave the Brahmin power to ruin the Kṣatriya by
embroiling him with the people<sup>13</sup> or with other Kṣatriyas.<sup>14</sup>
<div n="P"/>Towards the common people, on the other hand, the Kṣa-
triya stood in a relation of well-nigh unquestioned superiority.<sup>15</sup>
There are, however, references to occasional feuds between
[Page1-205+ 60]
the people and the nobles,<sup>16</sup> in which no doubt the inferior
numbers of the latter were compensated by their superior arms
and prowess. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>17</sup> the Vaiśya is
described as tributary to another ({%anyasya bali-kṛt%}), to be
devoured by another ({%anyasyādya%}), and to be oppressed at will
({%yathākāma-jyeya%}). Probably these epithets apply most strictly
to the relation of the king and his people, but the passage
shows that the people were greatly at the mercy of the nobles.
No doubt the king granted to them the right, which may have
been hereditary, to be supported by the common people,
whose feudal superiors they thus became. In return for these
privileges the Kṣatriyas had probably duties of protection to
perform, as well as some judicial functions, to judge from an
obscure passage of the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā.<sup>18</sup>
<div n="P"/>The main duty of the Kṣatriya in the small states<sup>19</sup> of the
Vedic period was readiness for war. The bow is thus his
special attribute,<sup>20</sup> just as the goad is that of the agriculturist;
for the bow is the main weapon of the Veda. Whether the
Kṣatriyas paid much attention to mental occupations is
uncertain. In the latest stratum of the Brāhmaṇa literature
there are references to learned princes like {@Janaka@} of {@Videha,@}
who is said to have become a Brahmin ({%brahmā%}), apparently in
the sense that he had the full knowledge which a Brahmin
possessed.<sup>21</sup> Other learned Kṣatriyas of this period were
[Page1-206+ 62]
{@Pravāhaṇa Jaivali,@}<sup>22</sup> {@Aśvapati Kaikeya,@}<sup>23</sup> and Ajātaśatru.<sup>24</sup>
Garbe,<sup>25</sup> Grierson,<sup>26</sup> and others believe they are justified in
holding the view that the Ksatriyas developed a special
philosophy of their own as opposed to Brahminism, which
appears later as Bhakti, or Faith. On the other hand, there
is clear evidence<sup>27</sup> that the opinion of Ksatriyas on such topics
were held in little respect, and it must be remembered that to
attribute wisdom to a king was a delicate and effective piece
of flattery. There are earlier references to royal sages ({%rājan-%}
{%yarṣi%}),<sup>28</sup> but it is very doubtful if much stress can be laid on
them, and none can be laid on the later tradition of Sāyaṇa.<sup>29</sup>
Again, the Nirukta<sup>30</sup> gives a tradition relating how {@Devāpi,@}
a king's son, became the Purohita of his younger brother
{@Śaṃtanu;@} but it is very doubtful if the story can really be
traced with Sieg<sup>31</sup> in the Rigveda<sup>32</sup> itself. In any case, the
stories refer only to a few selected Kṣatriyas of high rank,
while there is no evidence that the average Kṣatriya was
concerned with intellectual pursuits. Nor is there any
reference to Kṣatriyas engaging in agriculture or in trade
or commerce. It may be assumed that the duties of
administration and war were adequate to absorb his atten-
tion. On the other hand, we do hear of a Rājanya
[Page1-207+ 54]
as a lute player and singer at the Aśvamedha or horse
sacrifice.<sup>33</sup>
<div n="P"/>Of the training and education of a Kṣatriya we have no
record; presumably, as in fact if not in theory later on, he was
mainly instructed in the art of war, the science of the bow, and
the rudimentary administrative functions which would devolve
on him. At this early state of the development of the nobility
which appears to be represented in the Rigveda, it was probably
not unusual or impossible for a Vaiśya to become a Kṣatriya;
at least, this assumption best explains the phrase<sup>34</sup> ‘claiming
falsely a Kṣatriya's rank’ ({%kṣatriyaṃ mithuyā dhārayantam%}).
<div n="P"/>The king and the Kṣatriyas must have stood in a particularly
close relation. The former being the Kṣatriya {%par excellence,%}
it is to him rather than to the ordinary Kṣatriya that we must
refer passages like that in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>35</sup> where it
is said that the Kṣatriya, with the consent of the clansmen,
gives a settlement to a man: clearly a parallel to the rule found
among many peoples that the chief, but only with the consent of
the people, can make a grant of unoccupied land. In the same
Brāhmaṇa<sup>36</sup> it is said that a Kṣatriya consecrates a Kṣatriya, a
clear reference, as the commentator explains, to the practice of
the old king consecrating the prince ({%kumāra%}) who is to succeed
him; and again,<sup>37</sup> the Kṣatriya and the Purohita are regarded
as alone complete in contrast with other people, the parallel
with the Purohita here suggesting that the Kṣatriya {%par excellence%}
is meant. On the other hand, the king is sometimes con-
trasted with the Rājanya.<sup>38</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Sūtra literature contains elaborate rules<sup>39</sup> for the educa-
[Page1-208+ 49]
tion and occupations of Kṣatriyas, but their contents cannot
always be traced in the Brāhmaṇa literature, and their value is
questionable.

razor on a grindstone<sup>5</sup> ({%bhurijos,%} the dual denoting precisely, as
Pischel<sup>6</sup> points out, the two sides of the apparatus, between
which the stone revolved like the modern grindstone). But
Muir,<sup>7</sup> following another view of Roth,<sup>8</sup> adopts the sense ‘the
edge of scissors,’ which, however, hardly suits the other
passage, one in the Atharvaveda,<sup>9</sup> where a Kṣura is described
as moving about on the {%bhurijos,%}<sup>10</sup> as the tongue on the lip. The
meaning ‘razor’ is perfectly clear in the Atharvaveda,<sup>11</sup> where
shaving by means of it is mentioned; in many other passages<sup>12</sup>
either sense is adequate. A {%kṣuro bhṛjvān%} occurs in the Yajur-

1. {@Khila,@}¦<sup>1</sup> {@Khilya@}<sup>2</sup> appear to have the same meaning.
According to Roth,<sup>3</sup> these terms denote the waste land lying
between cultivated fields; but he admits that this sense does
not suit the passage of the Rigveda<sup>4</sup> in which it is said that
the god places the worshipper on an unbroken Khilya ({%abhinne%}
{%khilye%}), and he accordingly conjectures the reading {%akhilya-%}
{%bhinne,%} ‘land unbroken by barren strips.’ Pischel<sup>5</sup> thinks that
the meaning intended is broad lands, which were used for the
pasturing of the cattle of the community, and were not broken
up by cultivated fields. Oldenberg,<sup>6</sup> however, points out that
the sense is rather the land which lay between cultivated fields,
but which need not be deemed to have been unfertile, as
Roth thought. This agrees with the fact that in Vedic
times separate fields were already known: see {@Kṣetra.@}

{@Gāthā@}¦ in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> usually means only ‘song,’ ‘verse,’
like Gātu.<sup>2</sup> In one passage,<sup>3</sup> however, it already has a more
special sense, as it is classed with {@Nārāśaṃsī@} and {@Raibhī,@} a
collocation repeatedly found later.<sup>4</sup> The commentators identify
the three terms with certain verses of the Atharvaveda,<sup>5</sup> but
Oldenberg<sup>6</sup> has shown that this identification is incorrect for
the Rigveda. Gāthās are often mentioned elsewhere,<sup>7</sup> and are
referred to as metrical in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka,<sup>8</sup> where the
{@Ṛc, Kumbyā,@} and Gāthā are classed as forms of verse. The
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>9</sup> distinguishes between Ṛc and Gāthā as
divine and human respectively. According to the usage of the
[Page1-225+ 51]
Brāhmaṇas and the liturgical literature, as stated by the St.
Petersburg Dictionary, the Gāthās are, though religious in
content, distinguished from Ṛc, Yajus, and Sāman as non-
Vedic — that is, are not Mantras. This view is consistent with
the fact that the phrase {@Yajña-gāthā,@} meaning a verse
summarizing a sacrificial usage, is not rare. The Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa<sup>10</sup> preserves several Gāthās, which generally accord
with this description as epitomizing the sacrifices of famous
kings, and the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā<sup>11</sup> states that a Gāthā is
sung at a wedding. Sometimes<sup>12</sup> Gāthā is qualified as
Nārāśaṃsī, where it must be a eulogy of a generous donor.

{@Gṛha@}¦ is used in the singular,<sup>1</sup> or oftener in the plural,<sup>2</sup> to
denote the ‘house’ of the Vedic Indian. {@Dama@} or {@Dam@} has
[Page1-230+ 62]
the same sense, while {@Pastyā@} and {@Harmya@} denote more
especially the home with its surroundings, the family settle-
ment. The house held not only the family, which might be of
considerable size, but also the cattle<sup>3</sup> and the sheep<sup>4</sup> at night.
It was composed of several rooms, as the use of the plural
indicates, and it could be securely shut up.<sup>5</sup> The door ({@Dvār,@}
{@Dvāra@}) is often referred to, and from it the house is called
{@Duroṇa.@} In every house the fire was kept burning.<sup>6</sup>
<div n="P"/>Very little is known of the structure of the house. Presum-
ably stone was not used,<sup>7</sup> and houses were, as in Megasthenes'
time,<sup>8</sup> built of wood. The hymns of the Atharvaveda<sup>9</sup> give
some information about the construction of a house, but the
details are extremely obscure, for most of the expressions used
do not recur in any context in which their sense is clear.
According to Zimmer,<sup>10</sup> four pillars ({@Upamit@}) were set up on a
good site, and against them beams were leant at an angle as
props ({@Pratimit@}). The upright pillars were connected by cross
beams ({@Parimit@}) resting upon them. The roof was formed of
ribs of bamboo cane ({%vaṃśa%}),<sup>11</sup> a ridge called {@Viṣūvant,@} and a
net ({@Akṣu@}), which may mean a thatched covering<sup>12</sup> over the
bamboo ribs. The walls were filled up with grass in bundles
({%palada%}), and the whole structure was held together with ties of
[Page1-231+ 53]
various sorts ({%nahana, prāṇāha, saṃdaṃśa, pariṣvañjalya%}).<sup>13</sup> In
connexion with the house, mention is made of four terms which,
though primarily sacrificial in meaning, seem to designate parts
of the building: Havirdhāna, ‘oblation-holder’; Agniśāla,<sup>14</sup> ‘fire-
place’; Patnīnāṃ Sadana, ‘wives’ room’; and Sadas, ‘sitting
room.’ Slings or hanging vessels ({@Śikya@}) are also mentioned.<sup>15</sup>
Reedwork ({%iṭa%}) is spoken of, no doubt as part of the finishing
of the walls of the house.<sup>16</sup> The sides are called {@Pakṣa.@} The
door with its framework was named {@Ātā.@}

1. {@Go@}¦ ({%a%}), ‘ox’ or ‘cow.’<sup>1</sup> These were among the chief
sources of wealth to the Vedic Indian, and are repeatedly
[Page1-232+ 62]
referred to from the Rigveda onwards.<sup>2</sup> The milk ({@Kṣīra@}) was
either drunk fresh or made into butter ({@Ghṛta@}) or curds ({@Dadhi@}),
or was mixed with {@Soma@} or used for cooking with grain
({@Kṣīraudana@}). The cows were milked thrice a day, early
({%prātar-doha%}), in the forenoon ({@Saṃgava@}), and in the evening
({%sāyaṃ-doha%}).<sup>3</sup> Thrice a day they were driven out to graze,
according to the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>4</sup> ({%prātaḥ, saṃgave, sāyam%}).
The first milking was productive, the last two scanty.<sup>3</sup> According
to the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>5</sup> among the Bharatas the herds in
the evening are in the {@Goṣṭha,@} at midday in the {@Saṃgavīnī.@}
This passage Sāyaṇa expands by saying that the herds go home
to the Śālā, or house for animals, at night so far as they consist
of animals giving milk, while the others stayed out in the
Goṣṭha, or open pasturage; but both were together in the
cattle-shed during the heat of the day. The time before
the Saṃgava, when the cows were grazing freely on the
pastureland, was called {@Svasara.@}<sup>6</sup> When the cows were out
feeding they were separated from the calves, which were, how-
ever, allowed to join them at the Saṃgava,<sup>7</sup> and sometimes in
the evening.<sup>8</sup>
<div n="P"/>While grazing the cattle were under the care of a herdsman
({@Gopā, Gopāla@}) armed with a goad,<sup>9</sup> but they were liable to all sorts
of dangers, such as being lost, falling into pits, breaking limbs,<sup>10</sup>
[Page1-233+ 60]
and being stolen. The marking of the ears of cattle was
repeatedly adopted, no doubt, to indicate ownership.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="P"/>Large herds of cattle were well-known, as is shown by the
Dānastutis, or ‘praises of gifts,’ in the Rigveda,<sup>12</sup> even when
allowances are made for the exaggeration of priestly gratitude.
The importance attached to the possession of cattle is shown<sup>13</sup>
by the numerous passages in which the gods are asked to prosper
them, and by the repeated prayers<sup>14</sup> for wealth in kine. Hence,
too, forays for cattle ({@Gaviṣṭi@}) were well known; the Bharata
host is called the ‘horde desiring cows’ ({%gavyan grāmaḥ%}) in the
Rigveda;<sup>15</sup> and a verbal root {%gup,%}<sup>16</sup> ‘to protect,’ was evolved as
early as the Rigveda from the denominative {%go-pāya,%} ‘to guard
cows.’ The Vedic poets<sup>17</sup> do not hesitate to compare their
songs with the lowing of cows, or to liken the choir of the
singing Apsarases to cows.<sup>18</sup>
<div n="P"/>The cattle of the Vedic period were of many colours: red
({%rohita%}), light ({%śukra%}), dappled ({%pṛśni%}), even black ({%kṛṣṇa%}).<sup>19</sup>
Zimmer<sup>20</sup> sees a reference to cows with blazes on the face in one
passage of the Rigveda,<sup>21</sup> but this is uncertain.
<div n="P"/>Oxen were regularly used for ploughing or for drawing
wagons ({%anaḍvāh%}), in which case they were, it seems, usually
castrated.<sup>22</sup> Cows were not properly used for drawing carts,
though they at times did so.<sup>23</sup> The flesh of both cows and
bulls was sometimes eaten ({@Māmsa@}). Cattle were certainly the
[Page1-234+ 44]
objects of individual ownership, and they formed one of the
standards of exchange and valuation (see {@Kraya@}).
<div n="P"/>({%b%}) The term {@Go@} is often applied to express the products of
the cow. It frequently means the milk,<sup>1</sup> but rarely the flesh<sup>2</sup> of
the animal. In many passages it designates leather used as the
material of various objects, as a bowstring,<sup>3</sup> or a sling,<sup>4</sup> or
thongs to fasten part of the chariot,<sup>5</sup> or reins,<sup>6</sup> or the lash
of a whip.<sup>7</sup> See also {@Carman,@} with which Go is sometimes
synonymous.<sup>8</sup>
<div n="P"/>({%c%}) {@Gāvaḥ@} means the stars of heaven in two passages of the
Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> according to Roth.<sup>2</sup>

shows in the later literature as denoting the ‘family’ or ‘clan,’
and which is found in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Gṛhya Sūtras<sup>5</sup> stress is laid on the prohibition of
[Page1-236+ 55]
marriage within a Gotra, or with a Sapiṇḍa of the mother of
the bridegroom — that is to say, roughly, with agnates and
cognates. Senart<sup>6</sup> has emphasized this fact as a basis of caste,
on the ground that marriage within a {%curia, phratria,%} or caste
({@Varṇa@}) was Indo-European, as was marriage outside the circle
of agnates and cognates. But there is no evidence at all<sup>7</sup> to
prove that this practice was Indo-European, while in India the
Śatapatha<sup>8</sup> expressly recognizes marriage within the third or
fourth degree on either side. According to Sāyaṇa, the Kāṇvas
accepted marriage in the third degree, the Saurāṣṭras only in
the fourth, while the scholiast on the Vajrasūcī<sup>9</sup> adḍs to the
Kāṇvas the Andhras and the Dākṣiṇātyas, and remarks that
the Vājasaneyins forbade marriage with the daughter of the
mother's brother. All apparently allowed marriage with the
daughter of a paternal uncle, which later was quite excluded.
Change of Gotra was quite possible, as in the case of {@Śunaḥ-@}
{@śepa@} and {@Gṛtsamada,@} who, once an Aṅgirasa, became a

{@Graha@}¦ (‘seizing’) is a term applied to the sun in the Śata-
patha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>1</sup> most probably not in the later sense of
‘planet,’ but to denote a power exercising magical influence.<sup>2</sup>
The sense of ‘planet’ seems first to occur in the later literature,
as in the Maitrāyaṇī Upaniṣad.<sup>3</sup> The question whether the
planets were known to the Vedic Indians is involved in
obscurity. Oldenberg<sup>4</sup> recognizes them in the Ādityas, whose
number is, he believes, seven; sun, moon, and the five planets.
But this view, though it cannot be said to be impossible or even
unlikely, is not susceptible of proof, and has been rejected by
Hillebrandt,<sup>5</sup> Pischel,<sup>6</sup> von Schroeder,<sup>7</sup> Macdonell,<sup>8</sup> and Bloom-
field,<sup>9</sup> among others. Hillebrandt<sup>10</sup> sees the planets in the five
Adhvaryus mentioned in the Rigveda,<sup>11</sup> but this is a mere con-
jecture. The five bulls ({%ukṣāṇaḥ%}) in another passage of the
Rigveda<sup>12</sup> have received a similar interpretation with equal
uncertainty,<sup>13</sup> and Durga, in his commentary on the Nirukta,<sup>14</sup>
even explains the term {%bhūmija,%} ‘earth-born,’ which is only men-
tioned by Yāska, as meaning the planet Mars.<sup>15</sup> Thibaut,<sup>16</sup>
who is generally sceptical as to the mention of planets in the
Veda, thinks that Bṛhaspati there refers to Jupiter; but this is
extremely improbable, though in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>17</sup>
Bṛhaspati is made the regent of Tiṣya. A reference to the
[Page1-244+ 55]
planets is much more probable in the seven suns ({%sapta sūryāḥ%})
of the late Taittirīya Āraṇyaka.<sup>18</sup> On the other hand, Ludwig's
efforts to find the five planets with the sun, the moon, and the
twenty-seven Nakṣatras (lunar mansions) in the Rigveda, as
corresponding to the number thirty-four used in connexion with
light<sup>19</sup> ({%jyotis%}) and the ribs of the sacrificial horse,<sup>20</sup> is far-
fetched. See also {@Śukra, Manthin, Vena.@}

{@Grāma.@}¦ — The primitive sense of this word, which occurs
frequently from the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> onwards, appears to have been
‘village.’ The Vedic Indians must have dwelt in villages which
were scattered over the country, some close together,<sup>2</sup> some far
apart, and were connected by roads.<sup>3</sup> The village is regularly
contrasted with the forest ({%araṇya%}), and its animals and plants
with those that lived or grew wild in the woods.<sup>4</sup> The villages
contained cattle, horses, and other domestic animals, as well as
men.<sup>5</sup> Grain was also stored in them.<sup>6</sup> In the evening the
cattle regularly returned thither from the forest.<sup>7</sup> The villages
were probably open, though perhaps a fort ({@Pur@}) might on
[Page1-245+ 58]
occasion be built inside.<sup>8</sup> Presumably they consisted of
detached houses with enclosures, but no details are to be found
in Vedic literature. Large villages ({%mahāgrāmāḥ%}) were known.<sup>9</sup>
<div n="P"/>The relation of the villagers is difficult to ascertain with
precision. In several passages<sup>10</sup> the word occurs with what
appears to be the derivative sense of ‘body of men.’ This
sense presumably started from the use of the word to denote
the ‘village folk,’ as when {@Śaryāta Mānava@} is said in the
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>11</sup> to have wandered about with his
‘village’ ({%grāmeṇa%}); but, as Zimmer<sup>12</sup> observes, this restricted
sense nowhere appears clearly in the Rigveda,<sup>13</sup> where indeed
the ‘folk’ ({%jana%})<sup>14</sup> of the Bharatas is in one passage<sup>15</sup> called
the ‘horde seeking cows’ ({%gavyan grāmaḥ%}). Zimmer<sup>16</sup> tends to
regard the Grāma as a clan, and as standing midway between
the family and the tribe ({@Viś@}). The Grāma may, however,
perhaps be regarded more correctly<sup>17</sup> as an aggregate of several
families, not necessarily forming a clan, but only part of a clan
({@Viś@}), as is often the case at the present day.<sup>18</sup>
<div n="P"/>Vedic literature tells us very little about the social economy
of the village. There is nothing to show that the community
as such held land. What little evidence there is indicates that
individual tenure of land was known (see {@Urvarā, Kṣetra@}), but
this, in effect though not in law, presumably meant tenure by a
family rather than by an individual person. The expression
[Page1-246+ 58]
‘desirous of a village’ ({%grāma-kāma%}), which occurs frequently in
the later Saṃhitās,<sup>19</sup> points, however, to the practice of the king's
granting to his favourites his royal prerogatives over villages so
far as fiscal matters were concerned. Later<sup>20</sup> the idea developed
that the king was owner of all the land, and parallel with that
idea the view that the holders of such grants were landlords.
But of either idea there is no vestige in Vedic literature beyond
the word {%grāma-kāma,%} which much more probably refers to the
grant of regalia than to the grant of land, as Teutonic parallels
show.<sup>21</sup> Such grants probably tended to depress the position
of the actual cultivators, and to turn them into tenants, but
they can hardly have had this effect to any appreciable extent
in early times.
<div n="P"/>The village does not appear to have been a unit for legal
purposes in early days,<sup>22</sup> and it can hardly be said to have been
a political unit. The village no doubt, as later, included in its
members various menials, besides the cultivating owners, and
also the Brāhmaṇas and Kṣatriyas who might hold interest
in it by royal grant or usage without actually cultivating land,
such as chariot-makers ({@Ratha-kāra@}), carpenters ({@Takṣan@}),
smiths ({@Karmāra@}), and others, but they did not presumably, in
any sense, form part of the brotherhood.<sup>23</sup> All alike were
politically subject to the king, and bound to render him food or
service or other tribute, unless he had transferred his rights to
[Page1-247+ 60]
others of the royal family or household, as was no doubt often
the case, either in whole or part. The king's share in a village
is referred to as early as the Atharvaveda.<sup>24</sup>
<div n="P"/>At the head of the village was the Grāma-ṇī, or ‘leader of
the village,’ who is referred to in the Rigveda,<sup>25</sup> and often in
the later Saṃhitās and in the Brāhmaṇas.<sup>26</sup> The exact
meaning of the title is not certain. By Zimmer<sup>27</sup> the Grāmaṇī
is regarded as having had military functions only, and he is
certainly often connected with the {@Senānī,@} or ‘leader of an
army.’ But there is no reason so to restrict the sense: pre-
sumably the Grāmaṇī was the head of the village both for civil
purposes and for military operations. He is ranked in the
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>28</sup> as inferior to the {@Sūta,@} or ‘charioteer,’
with whom, however, he is associated<sup>29</sup> as one of the {@Ratnins,@}
the ‘jewels’ of the royal establishment. The post was especially
valuable to a Vaiśya, who, if he attained it, was at the summit
of prosperity ({%gataśrī%}).<sup>30</sup> The Grāmaṇī's connexion with the
royal person seems to point to his having been a nominee of
the king rather than a popularly elected officer. But the post
may have been sometimes hereditary, and sometimes nomi-
nated or elective: there is no decisive evidence available.
The use of the singular presents difficulties: possibly the
Grāmaṇī of the village or city where the royal residence was
situated was specially honoured and influential.<sup>31</sup>

{@Ghṛta,@}¦ the modern Ghee or ‘clarified butter,’ is repeatedly
mentioned in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later<sup>2</sup> both as in ordinary use
and as a customary form of sacrifice. According to a citation
in Sāyaṇa's commentary on the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>3</sup> the dis-
tinction between Ghṛta and {@Sarpis@} consisted in the latter being
butter fully melted, while the former was butter melted and
hardened ({%ghanī-bhūta%}), but this distinction cannot be pressed.
Because the butter was thrown into the fire, Agni is styled
‘butter-faced’ ({%ghṛta-pratīka%}),<sup>4</sup> ‘butter-backed’ ({%ghṛta-pṛṣṭha%}),<sup>5</sup>
and ‘propitiated with butter’ ({%ghṛta-prasatta%}),<sup>6</sup> and ‘found of
butter’ ({%ghṛta-prī%}).<sup>7</sup> Water was used to purify the butter: the
waters were therefore called ‘butter-cleansing’ ({%ghṛta-pū%}).<sup>8</sup> In
the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa^9 it is said that Ājya, Ghṛta, Āyuta, and
Navanīta pertain to gods, men, Pitṛs, and embryos respectively.

{@Cakra,@}¦ the ‘wheel’ of a chariot or wagon, is repeatedly
mentioned from the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> onwards, often in a metaphorical
sense. The wheel was fixed on the axle ({@Akṣa@}) when the
chariot was required for use; this required considerable
strength, as is shown by a reference in the Rigveda.<sup>2</sup> The
wheel consisted normally of spokes ({@Ara@}), and a nave ({@Nābhi@}),<sup>3</sup>
in the opening ({@Kha@}) of which the end of the axle ({@Āṇi@}) was
inserted. An indication of the importance attached to the
strength of the wheel is the celebration of the car of the god
Pūṣan as having a wheel that suffers no damage.<sup>4</sup> The usual
number of wheels was two,<sup>5</sup> but in seven passages of the Rigveda<sup>6</sup>
a chariot is called ‘three-wheeled,’ in a few others ‘seven-
wheeled,’<sup>7</sup> while in one of the Atharvaveda<sup>8</sup> it is styled ‘eight-
wheeled.’ Zimmer<sup>9</sup> argues that these epithets do not refer to
real chariots, pointing out that in all the passages where
{%tri-cakra,%} ‘three-wheeled,’ occurs there is a mythical reference.
On the other hand, Weber<sup>10</sup> thinks that there might have been
chariots with three wheels, one being in the centre between the
two occupants. This is not very conclusive; at any rate, the
seven-wheeled and the eight-wheeled chariots can hardly be
regarded as indicating the existence of real vehicles with that
number of wheels.

{@Camū@}¦ is a term of somewhat doubtful sense occurring
repeatedly in the Rigveda, and connected with the preparation
of Soma. Zimmer<sup>1</sup> considers that in the dual it denotes the
two boards between which, in his opinion, the Soma was
crushed ({%cf.%} {@Adhiṣavaṇa@}). Roth,<sup>2</sup> however, appears to be right
in taking the normal sense to designate a vessel into which the
Soma was poured from the press, and Hillebrandt<sup>3</sup> shows
clearly that when it occurs in the plural<sup>4</sup> it always has this
sense, corresponding to the Graha-pātras of the later ritual,
and that sometimes it is so used in the singular<sup>5</sup> or dual<sup>6</sup> also.
In some cases,<sup>7</sup> however, he recognizes its use as denoting the
mortar in which the Soma was pressed: he may be right here,
as this mode of preparation was probably Indo-Iranian.<sup>8</sup>

{@Cātur-māsya,@}¦ ‘four-monthly,’ denotes the festival of the
Vedic ritual held at the beginning of the three seasons of four
months each, into which the Vedic year was artificially divided.<sup>1</sup>
It is clear that the sacrifices commenced with the beginning
of each season,<sup>2</sup> and it is certain that the first of them, the
Vaiśvadeva, coincided with the Phālgunī full moon,<sup>3</sup> the second,
the Varuṇa-praghāsas, with the Āṣāḍhī full moon,<sup>4</sup> and the
third, the Sāka-medha, with the Kārttikī full moon.<sup>5</sup> There
were, however, two alternative datings: the festivals could also
be held in the Caitrī, the Śrāvaṇī, and Āgrahāyaṇī (Mārgaśīrṣī)
full moons,<sup>6</sup> or in the Vaiśākhī, Bhādrapadī, and Pauṣī full
moons.<sup>7</sup> Neither of the later datings is found in a Brāhmaṇa
text, but each may well have been known early, since the
Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>8</sup> and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>9</sup> both
recognize the full moon in the month Caitra as an alternative
to the full moon in the month Phālguna, for the beginning of
the year.
<div n="P"/>Jacobi considers that the commencement of the year with the
full moon in the asterism Phalgunī, which is supported by other
evidence,<sup>10</sup> indicates that the year at one time began with the winter
solstice with the moon in Phalgunī, corresponding to the summer
solstice when the sun was in Phalgunī. These astronomical
conditions, he believes, existed in the time of the Rigveda,<sup>11</sup>
and prevailed in the fourth millennium B.C. The alternative
[Page1-260+ 51]
dates would then indicate periods when the winter solstice
coincided with the Caitrī or the Vaiśākhī full moon. But
Oldenberg<sup>12</sup> and Thibaut<sup>13</sup> seem clearly right in holding that
the coincidence of Phālgunī with the beginning of spring,<sup>14</sup>
which is certain, is fatal to this view, and that there is no
difficulty in regarding this date as consistent with the date of
the winter solstice in the new moon of Māgha, which is given
by the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa,<sup>15</sup> and which forms the basis of
the calculations of the Jyotiṣa.<sup>16</sup> The full moon in Phālguna
would be placed about one month and a half after the winter
solstice, or, say, in the first week of February, which date,
according to Thibaut, may reasonably be deemed to mark the
beginning of a new season in India about 800 B.C. At the
same time it must be remembered that the date was necessarily
artificial, inasmuch as the year was divided into three seasons,
each of four months, and the Indian year does not in fact
consist of three equal seasons. The variations of the other
datings would then not be unnatural if any school wished to
defer its spring festival, the Vaiśvadeva, to the time when
spring had really manifested itself. See also {@Saṃvatsara.@}

{@Cyavana,@}¦<sup>1</sup> {@Cyavāna,@}<sup>2</sup> are variant forms of the name of an
ancient Ṛṣi, or seer. The Rigveda<sup>3</sup> represents him as an old
decrepit man, to whom the Aśvins restored youth and strength,
making him acceptable to his wife, and a husband of maidens.
[Page1-265+ 49]
The legend is given in another form in the Śatapatha Brāh-
maṇa,<sup>4</sup> where Cyavana is described as wedding Sukanyā,
the daughter of {@Śaryāta.@} He is there called a Bhṛgu or
Āṅgirasa, and is represented as having been rejuvenated by
immersion in a pond — the first occurrence of a motive, later
very common in Oriental literature. Another legend about
Cyavāna is apparently alluded to in an obscure hymn of the
Rigveda,<sup>5</sup> where he seems to be opposed to the {@Paktha@} prince
{@Tūrvayāṇa,@} an Indra worshipper, while Cyavāna seems to
have been specially connected with the Aśvins. This explana-
tion of the hymn, suggested by Pischel,<sup>6</sup> is corroborated by the
Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>7</sup> which relates that {@Vidanvant,@} another
son of Bhṛgu, supported Cyavana against Indra, who was
angry with him for sacrificing to the Aśvins; it is also note-
worthy that the Aśvins appear in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>8</sup> as
obtaining a share in the sacrifice on the suggestion of Sukanyā.
But a reconciliation of Indra and Cyavana must have taken
place, because the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>9</sup> relates the inauguration
of {@Śāryāta@} by Cyavana with the great Indra consecration
({%aindreṇa mahābhiṣekeṇa%}). In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇā<sup>10</sup>
Cyavana is mentioned as a seer of Sāmans or Chants.

1. {@Chandas@}¦ in the Rigveda usually denotes a ‘song of
praise’ or ‘hymn.’<sup>1</sup> The original sense of the word, as derived
from the verb {%chand,%} ‘to please,’ was probably ‘attractive
spell,’ ‘magic hymn,’<sup>2</sup> which prevailed on the gods. In a very
late hymn of the Rigveda,<sup>3</sup> as well as in one of the Atharvaveda,<sup>4</sup>
the word is mentioned in the plural ({%chandāṃsi%}), beside Ṛc
({%ṛcaḥ%}), Sāman ({%sāmāni%}), and Yajus, and seems to retain its
original meaning, not improbably with reference to the magical
subject-matter of the Atharvaveda. From denoting a (metrical)
hymn it comes to mean ‘metre’ in a very late verse of the
Rigveda,<sup>5</sup> in which the ‘Gāyatrī, the Triṣṭubh, and all ({%sarvā%})
the metres ({%chandāṃsi%}) are mentioned. In the later Saṃhitās
three<sup>6</sup> or seven<sup>7</sup> metres are enumerated, and in the Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa<sup>8</sup> eight. By the time of the Rigveda Prātiśākhya<sup>9</sup>
the metres were subjected to a detailed examination, though
much earlier references are found to the number of syllables in

{@Jana,@}¦ besides meaning ‘man’ as an individual, with a
tendency to the collective sense, commonly denotes a ‘people’
or ‘tribe’ in the Rigveda and later. Thus, the ‘five tribes’
({@Panca Janāḥ@} or {@Janāsaḥ@}) are frequently referred to, and in
one hymn of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> the ‘people of Yadu’ ({%yādva jana%})
and the {@Yadus@} ({%yādvāḥ%}) are synonymous. Again, the king
({%rājan%}) is described as ‘protector ({%gopā%}) of the people ({%janasya%}),’<sup>2</sup>
and there are other references to king and Jana.<sup>3</sup> The people
of the {@Bharatas@} ({%bhārata jana%}) is also mentioned;<sup>4</sup> there is no
ground to assume with Hopkins<sup>5</sup> that Jana in this case means
a clan or horde ({@Grāma@}), as distinguished from a people.
<div n="P"/>It is difficult to say exactly how a people was divided.
Zimmer<sup>6</sup> argues from a passage in the Rigveda<sup>7</sup> that a people
was divided into cantons ({@Viś@}), cantons into joint families or
clans, or village communities ({@Grāma, Vṛjana@}), and these again
into single families. He thinks that the four divisions are
reflected in the passage in question. by Jana, Viś, Janman, and
Putrāḥ, or sons, and argues that each village community was
originally founded on relationship. But it is very doubtful
whether this precise division of the people can be pressed. The
division of the Jana into several Viś may be regarded as
probable, for it is supported by the evidence of another passage
of the Rigveda,<sup>8</sup> which mentions the Viś as a unit of the fighting
men, and thus shows that, as in Homeric times and in ancient
Germany, relationship was deemed a good principle of military
arrangement. But the subdivision of the Viś into several
Grāmas is very doubtful. Zimmer<sup>9</sup> admits that neither Grāma<sup>10</sup>
[Page1-270+ 47]
nor {@Vṛjana@}<sup>11</sup> has the special sense of a subdivision of the Viś
when used for war, for both words only denote generally an
armed host. He finds other designations of the village host in
{@Vrā@}<sup>12</sup> and in {@Vrāja,@}<sup>13</sup> but it is sufficient to say that the former
passage is of extremely doubtful import,<sup>14</sup> and that the latter
has no reference to war at all. It is therefore impossible to state
in what exact relation the Grāma in Vedic times stood to the
Viś or to the family (Kula or Gotra). The confusion is increased
by the vagueness of the sense of both Grāma and Viś. If the
latter be regarded as a local division, then no doubt the Grāma
must have been a part of a district; but if a Viś was a unit of
relationship, then a Grāma may have contained families of
different Viśes, or may have sometimes coincided with a
Viś, or have contained only a part of a Viś. But in any
case the original state of affairs must have been greatly
modified by the rise of the system of caste, and the substitu-
tion of a hierarchical for a political point of view. The
elements of the people were represented by the family — either
as an individual family inhabiting one home ({@Kula@}), and con-
sisting often, no doubt, of a joint family of brothers, or as a
patriarchal family of sons who still lived with their father — and
by the clan, the later {@Gotra,@} which included all those who
claimed a common ancestor. The Gotra may be regarded as
roughly corresponding to the Latin {%gens%} and the Greek <lang n="greek">γένος</lang>,
and possibly the Viś may be the equivalent of the {%curia%} and
<lang n="greek">φρήτρη</lang>, and the Jana of the {%tribus%} and <lang n="greek">φῦλον</lang> or <lang n="greek">φῦλη</lang>.<sup>15</sup> These
three divisions may also be seen in the Viś, Zantu, and Daqyu
of the Iranian world, where the use of Viś suggests that in the
Indian Viś a relationship based on blood rather than locality is
meant — and perhaps even in the {%vicus, pagus,%} and {%civitas%} of the
old German polity described in the Germania<sup>16</sup> of Tacitus.
The family in some form appears as the third element of the
Jana in a passage of the Rigveda,<sup>17</sup> where the house ({%gṛha%}) is
[Page1-271+ 44]
contrasted with the Jana and the Viś. Possibly, too, another
passage<sup>18</sup> contrasts the {%adhvara,%} or family sacrifice, with that of
the Jana or Viś, rather than, as Zimmer<sup>19</sup> thinks, the village
with the two larger units. But it is significant of the particu-
larism of the Vedic Indians that while the king maintained a
fire which might be regarded as the sacred fire of the tribe,
there is no sure trace<sup>20</sup> of any intermediate cult between that of
the king and that of the individual householder. The real
elements in the state are the Gotra and the Jana, just as
ultimately the {%gens%} and {%tribus,%} the <lang n="greek">γένος</lang> and <lang n="greek">φῦλον</lang> are alone
important. It may be that Viś sometimes represents in the
older texts what later was known as the Gotra. See {@Viś.@}
<div n="P"/>This appears clearly when the constitution of society in the
Brāhmaṇa period is considered. The tribe or people still exists,
and is presupposed, but the division into Viś disappears. The
real division is now the separate castes ({@Varṇa@}), but the
numerous sections into which each of them is divided appear to
be based in part on the ancient Gotra.

mentioned as a teacher in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (x. 6, 1, 1

{@Janaka,@}¦ king of Videha, plays a considerable part in the
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> and the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad,<sup>2</sup>
as well as in the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup> and the Kauṣītaki
Upaniṣad.<sup>4</sup> He was a contemporary of {@Yājñavalkya Vāja-@}
[Page1-272+ 50]
{@saneya,@}<sup>5</sup> of {@Śvetaketu Āruṇeya,@} and of other sages.<sup>6</sup> He had
become famous for his generosity and his interest in the dis-
cussion of the nature of Brahman, as ultimate basis of reality,
in the life-time of {@Ajātaśatru@} of Kāśi.<sup>7</sup> It is significant that
he maintained a close intercourse with the Brahmins of the
Kuru-Pañcālas, such as Yājñavalkya and Śvetaketu; for this
indicates that the home of the philosophy of the Upaniṣads
was in the Kuru-Pañcāla country rather than in the east.
There is a statement in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>8</sup> that he
became a Brahmin ({%brahmā%}). This does not, however, signify
a change of caste, but merely that in knowledge he became
a Brahmin (see {@Kṣatriya@}). Janaka is occasionally mentioned
in later texts: in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>9</sup> he has already
become quite mythical; in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra<sup>10</sup>
a {%sapta-rātra%} or seven nights' rite is ascribed to him.
<div n="P"/>It is natural to attempt to date Janaka by his being a con-
temporary of Ajātaśatru, and by identifying the latter with the
Ajātasattu of the Pāli texts:<sup>11</sup> this would make the end of the
sixth century B.C. the approximate date of Janaka.<sup>12</sup> But it is
very doubtful whether this identification can be supported:
Ajātaśatru was king of Kāśi, whereas Ajātasattu was king of
Magadha, and his only connexion with Kāśi was through his
marriage with the daughter of Pasenadi of Kosala.<sup>13</sup> More-
over, the acceptance of this chronology would be difficult to
reconcile with the history of the development of thought; for
it would make the rise of Buddhism contemporaneous with the
Upaniṣads, whereas it is reasonably certain that the older
Upaniṣads preceded Buddhism.<sup>14</sup> Nor do the Vedic texts know
anything of Bimbisāra or Pasenadi, or any of the other princes
famed in Buddhist records.
[Page1-273+ 54]
<div n="P"/>The identification<sup>15</sup> of Janaka of Videha and the father of
Sītā is less open to objection, but it cannot be proved, and is
somewhat doubtful. In the Sūtras Janaka appears as an
ancient king who knew of a time when wifely honour was less
respected than later.<sup>16</sup>

capital, according to a Gāthā quoted in the Śatapatha<sup>4</sup> and

who performed the sacrifice for him was {@Indrota Daivāpi@}
{@Śaunaka.@}<sup>6</sup> On the other hand the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>7</sup> which
also mentions his Aśvamedha, names {@Tura Kāvaṣeya@} as his
priest. It also contains an obscure tale stating that at one
sacrifice of his he did not employ the {@Kaśyapas,@} but the
{@Bhūtavīras,@} being, however, induced by the {@Asitamṛgas@} to
have recourse to the Kaśyapas again.<sup>8</sup> He was a {@Kuru@} prince;

{@Jani, Janī.@}¦ — These words appear to denote ‘wife,’ usually

general sense of ‘woman’ is doubtful; for when Uṣas is called
a fair {@Janī,@}<sup>1</sup> ‘wife’ may be meant, and the other passage<sup>2</sup> cited
for this sense by Delbrück,<sup>3</sup> which refers to the begetting of
children, seems to demand the sense of ‘wives.’ Since the
words usually appear in the plural,<sup>4</sup> it is possible they may
[Page1-275+ 45]
refer not to ‘wives’ proper, but to Hetairai. This is, how-
ever, rendered unlikely because the Rigveda<sup>5</sup> uses the phrase
{%patyur janitvam,%} denoting ‘wifehood to a husband,’ as well
as the expression {%janayo na patnīḥ,%}<sup>6</sup> ‘like wives (who are)

thong of ox-hide.<sup>4</sup> It was not usually kept taut,<sup>5</sup> but was
specially tightened when the bow was to be used.<sup>6</sup> The sound
of the bowstring ({%jyā-ghoṣa%}) is referred to in the Atharvaveda.<sup>7</sup>

<L>1095<pc>1-294<k1>takman<k2>takman
{@Takman@}¦ is a disease repeatedly mentioned in the Athar-
vaveda, but later not known under this name. It is the subject
of five hymns<sup>1</sup> of the Atharvaveda, and is often mentioned else-
where.<sup>2</sup> Weber<sup>3</sup> first identified it with ‘fever,’ and Grohmann<sup>4</sup>
showed that all the symptoms pointed to that ailment.<sup>5</sup> Refer-
ence is made to the alternate hot and shivering fits of the
patient,<sup>6</sup> to the yellow colour of the jaundice which accompanies
the fever,<sup>7</sup> and to its peculiar periodicity. The words used to
describe its varieties are {%anye-dyuḥ,%}<sup>8</sup> {%ubhaya-dyuḥ,%}<sup>9</sup> {%tṛtīyaka,%}<sup>10</sup>
{%vi-tṛtīya,%}<sup>11</sup> and {%sadaṃ-di,%}<sup>12</sup> the exact sense of most of which
terms is somewhat uncertain. It is agreed<sup>13</sup> that the first
epithet designates the fever known as {%quotidianus,%} which recurs
each day at the same hour, though the word is curious (lit.
[Page1-295+ 54]
‘on the other — {%i.e.,%} next, day’). The {%ubhaya-dyuḥ%} (‘on both
days’) variety appears to mean a disease recurring for two suc-
cessive days, the third being free; this corresponds to the {%rhythmus%}
{%quartanus complicatus.%}<sup>14</sup> But Sāyaṇa considers that it means a
fever recurring on the third day, the ‘tertian.’ The {%tṛtīyaka,%}
however, must be the ‘tertian’ fever,<sup>15</sup> though Zimmer<sup>16</sup> suggests
that it may mean a fever which is fatal at the third paroxysm.
Grohmann<sup>17</sup> regards the {%vi-tṛtīyaka%} as equivalent to the {%tertiana%}
{%duplicata,%} a common form in southern countries, in which the
fever occurs daily, but with a correspondence in point of time
or severity of attack on alternate days. Bloomfield<sup>18</sup> suggests
that it is identical with the {%ubhaya-dyuḥ%} variety. The {%sadaṃ-di%}<sup>19</sup>
type appears to be the kind later known as {%saṃtata-jvara%}
(‘continuous fever’), in which there are attacks of several days’
duration, with an interval followed by a fresh period of attack.
Fever occurred at different seasons, in the autumn ({%śārada%}), in
the hot weather ({%graiṣma%}), in the rains ({%vārṣika%}),<sup>20</sup> but was
especially prevalent in the first, as is indicated by the epithet
{%viśva-śārada,%} ‘occurring every autumn.’<sup>21</sup>
<div n="P"/>The disease is said to arise when Agni enters the waters.<sup>22</sup>
From this Weber<sup>23</sup> deduced that it was considered to be the
result of a chill supervening on heat, or the influence of heat on
marshy land. Grohmann<sup>24</sup> preferred to see in this connexion
of the origin of the disease with Agni's entering the waters<sup>25</sup>
an allusion to the fact that fever arises in the rainy season, the
time when Agni, as lightning, descends to earth with the rain.
Zimmer.<sup>26</sup> who accepts this view, further refers to the prevalence
[Page1-296+ 41]
of fever in the Terai, and interprets {%vanya,%} an epithet of fever
found in the Atharvaveda,<sup>27</sup> as meaning ‘sprung from the
forest,’ pointing out that fever is mentioned as prevalent among
the {@Mūjavants@} and {@Mahāvṛṣas,@} two mountain tribes of the
western Himālaya.<sup>28</sup> There is no trace of fever having been
observed to be caused by the bite of the {%anopheles%} mosquito,
which breeds in stagnant water: this theory has without reason
been held to be known to classical Indian medicine.<sup>29</sup>
<div n="P"/>Among the symptoms of Takman, or among complications
accompanying it, are mentioned ‘itch’ ({@Pāman@}), ‘headache’
({%śīrṣa-śoka%}),<sup>30</sup> ‘cough’ ({@Kāsikā@}), and ‘consumption,’ or perhaps
some form of itch ({@Balāsa@}).
<div n="P"/>It is perhaps significant that the Takman does not appear
until the Atharvaveda. It is quite possible that the Vedic
Āryans, when first settled in India, did not know the disease,
which would take some generations to become endemic and
recognized as dangerous. What remedies they used against it
is quite uncertain, for the Atharvaveda mentions only spells
and the {@Kuṣṭha,@} which can hardly have been an effective
remedy, though still used in later times. Fever must, even in
the Atharvan period, have claimed many victims, or it would
not be mentioned so prominently.

{@Tāyu@}¦ was another name for thief, perhaps of a less
distinguished and more domestic character than the highway-
man, for though he is referred to as a cattle-thief,<sup>13</sup> he is also
alluded to as a stealer of clothes ({%vastra-mathi%})<sup>14</sup> and as a
debtor.<sup>15</sup> In one passage the Tāyus are said to disappear at
the coming of dawn (which is elsewhere called {%yāvayad-dveṣas,%}
‘driving away hostile beings,’ and {%ṛta-pā,%} ‘guardian of order’),
like the stars of heaven ({%nakṣatra%}).<sup>16</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Śatarudriya litany of the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>17</sup> Rudra
is called lord of assailers ({%ā-vyādhin%}), thieves ({%stena%}), robbers
({%taskara%}), pickpockets ({%stāyu%}), stealers ({%muṣṇant%}), and cutters
({%vi-kṛnta%}); and designations of sharpers ({%gṛtsa%}) and bands
({%gaṇa, vrāta%}), apparently of robbers, are mentioned.<sup>18</sup> It is
therefore not surprising that the Rigveda<sup>19</sup> should contain
many prayers for safety at home or on the way, or that
the Atharvaveda should devote several hymns to night<sup>20</sup>
chiefly for protection against the evil doings of thieves and
robbers.
<div n="P"/>Pischel<sup>21</sup> suggests that in one passage of the Rigveda<sup>22</sup>
{@Vasiṣṭha@} is represented as a burglar, but the admits that, since
Vasiṣṭha was attacking the house of his father Varuṇa, he was
only seeking to obtain what he may have regarded as his own.
But the interpretation of the hymn is not certain.<sup>23</sup>
<div n="P"/>Sāyaṇa's explanation of one passage of the Rigveda,<sup>24</sup> as
[Page1-304+ 60]
referring to professional cattle-trackers, like the Khojis of the
Panjab, seems quite probable.<sup>25</sup>
<div n="P"/>The punishment of thieves appears primarily to have been
left to the action of the robbed. The practice of binding them
in stocks<sup>26</sup> seems clearly referred to. But later, at any rate — 
and in all probability earlier also, as in other countries — a more
severe penalty could be exacted, and death inflicted by the
king.<sup>27</sup> There is no hint in Vedic literature of the mode of
conviction; a fire ordeal is not known to the Atharvaveda,<sup>28</sup>
and the ordeal known to the Chāndogya Upaniṣad<sup>29</sup> is not said
to be used in the case of theft. No doubt the stolen property
was recovered by the person robbed if he could obtain it.
Nothing is known as to what happened if the property had
passed from the actual thief into the possession of another
person.

<LEND>
[Page1-315+ 55]

<L>1171<pc>1-315<k1>turvaSa<k2>turvaSa
{@Turvaśa@}¦ occurs frequently in the Rigveda as the name of
a man or of a people, usually in connexion with {@Yadu.@} The
two words usually occur in the singular without any connecting
particle, {%Turvaśa Yadu%} or {%Yadu Turvaśa.%}<sup>2</sup> In a plural form
the name Turvaśa occurs once with the Yadus,<sup>3</sup> and once
alone<sup>4</sup> in a hymn in which the singular has already been used.
In one passage<sup>5</sup> the dual {%Turvaśā-Yadū%} actually occurs, and
in another<sup>6</sup> {%Yadus Turvaś ca,%} ‘Yadu and Turva.’ In other
passages<sup>7</sup> Turvaśa appears alone, while in one<sup>8</sup> Turvaśa and
Yādva occur.
<div n="P"/>From these facts Hopkins<sup>9</sup> deduces the erroneousness of the
ordinary view,<sup>10</sup> according to which Turvaśa is the name of
a tribe, the singular denoting the king, and regards Turvaśa
as the name of the Yadu king. But the evidence for this is
not conclusive. Without laying any stress on the argument
based on the theory<sup>11</sup> that the ‘five peoples’ of the Rigveda
are the {@Anus, Druhyus,@} Turvaśas, Yadus, and {@Pūrus,@} it is
perfectly reasonable to hold that the Turvaśas and Yadus were
two distinct though closely allied tribes. Such they evidently
were to the seers of the hymns which mention in the dual the
{%Turvaśā-Yadū%} and speak of {%Yadus Turvaś ca.%} This explanation
also suits best the use of the plural of Turvaśa in two Rigvedic
hymns.
<div n="P"/>In the Rigveda the chief exploit of Turvaśa was his partici-
pation in the war against {@Sudās,@} by whom he was defeated.<sup>12</sup>
Hopkins<sup>13</sup> suggests that he may have been named Turvaśa
because of his fleet ({%tura%}) escape from the battle. His escape
<div n="P"/>1 i. 36, 18; 54, 6; 174, 9; vi. 20,
12; 45, 1; viii. 4, 7; 7, 18; 9, 14;
45, 27; x. 49, 8. In vii. 18, 6, Turvaśa
is joined with Yakṣu, apparently a con-
temptuous variant of Yadu (Hopkins,
{%Journal of the American Oriental Society,%}
15, 261). {%Cf.%} {@Tṛtsu.@}
[Page1-316+ 54]
may have been assisted by Indra, for in some passages<sup>14</sup> Indra's
aid to Turvaśa (and) Yadu is referred to; it is also significant
that the Anu, and apparently the Druhyu, kings are mentioned
as having been drowned in the defeat, but not the Turvaśa
and Yadu kings, and that Turvaśa appears in the eighth book
of the Rigveda as a worshipper of Indra with the Anu prince,
the successor, presumably, of the one who was drowned.<sup>15</sup>
Griffith,<sup>16</sup> however, proposes to refer these passages to a defeat
by Turvaśa and Yadu of Arṇa and Citraratha on the {@Sarayu;@}<sup>17</sup>
but the evidence for this is quite inadequate.
<div n="P"/>Two passages of the Rigveda<sup>18</sup> seem to refer to an attack by
Turvaśa and Yadu on {@Divodāsa,@} the father of Sudās. It is
reasonable to suppose that this was an attack of the two
peoples on Divodāsa, for there is some improbability of the
references being to the Turvaśa, who was concerned in the
attack on Sudās, the son.
<div n="P"/>Zimmer<sup>19</sup> considers that the Turvaśas were also called {@Vṛcī-@}
{@vants.@} This view is based on a hymn<sup>20</sup> in which reference
is made to the defeat of the Vṛcīvants on the {@Yavyāvatī@} and
{@Hariyūpīyā@} in aid of Daivarāta, and of Turvaśa in aid of
{@Sṛñjaya,@} the latter being elsewhere<sup>21</sup> clearly the son of Deva-
rāta. But as this evidence for the identification of the Turvaśas
with the Vṛcīvants is not clear, it seems sufficient<sup>22</sup> to assume
that they were allies.
<div n="P"/>Later, in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>23</sup> the Turvaśas appear
as allies of the Pañcālas, Taurvaśa horses, thirty-three in
number, and armed men, to the number of 6,000, being
mentioned.<sup>24</sup> But otherwise the name disappears: this lends
[Page1-317+ 47]
probability to Oldenberge's conjecture<sup>25</sup> that the Turvaśas
became merged in the {@Pañcāla@} people. Hopkins<sup>26</sup> considers
that in the Śatapatha passage the horses were merely named
from the family of Turvaśa; but this view is less likely, since
it ignores the difficulty involved in the reference to the men.
<div n="P"/>It is impossible to be certain regarding the home of the
Turvaśas at the time of their conflict with Sudās. They
apparently crossed the {@Paruṣṇī,@}<sup>27</sup> but from which side is dis-
puted. The view of Pischel<sup>28</sup> and Geldner,<sup>29</sup> that they advanced
from the west towards the east, where the {@Bharatas@} were (see
{@Kuru@}), is the more probable.

{@Tṛtsu@}¦ occurs in the Rigveda, once in the singular<sup>1</sup> and several
times in the plural,<sup>2</sup> as a proper name. The Tṛtsus were
clearly helpers of {@Sudās@} in the great battle against the ten
kings, {@Śimyu,@} the {@Turvaśa,@} the {@Druhyu, Kavaṣa,@} the {@Pūru,@}
the {@Anu, Bheda, Śambara,@} the two {@Vaikarṇas,@} and perhaps
the {@Yadu,@} who led with them as allies<sup>3</sup> the {@Matsyas, Pakthas,@}
{@Bhalānas, Alinas, Viṣāṇins, Śivas, Ajas, Śigrus,@} and perhaps
Yakṣus.<sup>4</sup> The defeat of the ten kings is celebrated in one
[Page1-321+ 56]
hymn of the Rigveda,<sup>5</sup> and is evidently alluded to in two
others.<sup>6</sup> The great battle took place on the {@Paruṣṇī,@} but there
was also a fight on the {@Yamunā@} with Bheda, the Ajas, Śigrus,
and Yakṣus. As the Yamunā and the Parusṇī represent
opposite ends of the territory of the Tṛtsus (for we cannot
with Hopkins<sup>7</sup> safely identify the streams), it is difficult to see
exactly how the ten kings could be confederated, but it should
be noted that the references to the ten kings occur in the two
later hymns,<sup>6</sup> and not in the hymn<sup>5</sup> describing the battle itself;
besides, absolute numerical accuracy cannot be insisted upon.
<div n="P"/>It is difficult exactly to determine the character of the
Tṛtsus; especially in their relation to the Bharatas, who under
Viśvāmitra's guidance are represented as prospering and as
advancing to the {@Vipāś@} and {@Śutudrī.@}<sup>8</sup> Roth ingeniously
brought this into connexion with the defeat of his enemies
by Sudās, which is celebrated in the seventh book of the
Rigveda — a book attributed to the Vasiṣṭha family — and thought
that there was a reference in one verse<sup>9</sup> to the defeat of the
Bharatas by Sudās. But it seems certain that the verse is
mistranslated, and that the Bharatas are really represented as
victors with Sudās.<sup>10</sup> Ludwig<sup>11</sup> accordingly identifies the
Tṛtsus and the Bharatas. Oldenberg,<sup>12</sup> after accepting this
view at first,<sup>13</sup> later expressed the opinion that the Tṛtsus were
the priests of the Bharata people, and therefore identical with
the Vasiṣṭhas. This view is supported by the fact that in one
passage<sup>14</sup> the Tṛtsus are clearly described as wearing their
hair in the peculiar manner affected by the Vasiṣṭhas,<sup>15</sup> and
would in that passage thus seem to represent the Vasiṣṭhas.
[Page1-322+ 59]
But Geldner<sup>16</sup> has suggested with great probability that Tṛtsu,
who is once mentioned in the singular,<sup>17</sup> means the Tṛtsu
king — that is, Sudās.<sup>18</sup> This explanation alone justifies the
description<sup>19</sup> of the Bharatas as {%Tṛtsūnāṃ viśaḥ,%}<sup>20</sup> ‘subjects of
the Tṛtsus,’ meaning the Tṛtsu Gotra or family, for the people
could not be said to be subjects of a body of priests. The
Vasiṣṭhas might be called Tṛtsus because of their close con-
nexion with the royal house of that people. The reverse
process is also quite possible, but is rendered improbable by
the fact that the {@Pratṛdaḥ@} are referred to as receiving Vasiṣṭha.<sup>21</sup>
This name of the Tṛtsu dynasty is probably older than its
connexion with Vasiṣṭha in the time of Sudās, a conclusion
supported by the name of {@Pratardana,@} who is mentioned later
as a descendant of Divodāsa,<sup>22</sup> an ancestor of Sudās. The
Tṛtsu dynasty could therefore hardly have been referred to as
Vasiṣṭhas. For the further history of the dynasty and its
relation with Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra, see {@Sudās.@}
<div n="P"/>If the Tṛtsus and their subjects, the Bharatas, were in the
Rigvedic period at war with the tribes on either side of the
territory between the Paruṣṇī and the Yamunā, it is clear<sup>23</sup>
that later on they coalesced with the Pūrus and probably
others of those tribes to form the {@Kuru@} people. Already in
the Rigveda<sup>24</sup> the Tṛtsus are allied with the {@Sṛñjayas,@} and in
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>25</sup> one Purohita serves both Kurus
and Sṛñjayas.
[Page1-323+ 50]
<div n="P"/>Hillebrandt<sup>26</sup> considers that the Tṛtsus cannot be identified
with the Bharatas, but that Sudās and the Bharatas represent
an invading body, which, however, became allied with the
Tṛtsus and the Vasiṣṭha priests. He also thinks that the
Rigveda reveals a time when {@Divodāsa,@} the grandfather or
ancestor of Sudās, was living in Arachosia, on the {@Sarasvatī,@}
and warring against the {@Paṇis,@} whom he identifies with the
Parnians. But this conjecture<sup>27</sup> cannot be regarded as
probable. In the Sarasvatī<sup>28</sup> it is not necessary to see any
other river than the later Sarasvatī, in the middle country,
which flowed within the boundaries of the Tṛtsus: it is also
significant that there are references<sup>29</sup> to contests between
{@Turvaśa Yadu@} and Atithigva or Divodāsa. Thus there is no
reason to doubt that Divodāsa and the Bharatas were in the
middle country, and not in Iran.

<F>3) They were regarded as enemies of
the kings by Roth, {%Zur Litteratur und%}
{%Geschichte des Weda,%} 95, and by Zimmer,
{%op. cit.,%} 126, The latter, however,
altered his view (see pp. 430, 431,
which Hopkins, {%op. cit.,%} 260, has over-
looked), and there is no doubt that
the later opinion is correct. {%Cf.%} also
Ludwig, Translation of the Rigveda,
3, 173; Hopkins, 260, 261. Of these
tribes the Pakthas, Alinas, Bhalānas,
Viṣāṇins, and Śivas, were probably
settled in the north-west, to the west
of the Indus, and around the Kabul
River. The Anus, Pūrus, Turvaśas,
Yadus, and Druhyus, were probably
tribes of the Panjab; the Ajas, Śigrus,
and Yakṣus, tribes of the east, under
Bheda; Śambara may also have been
a native of the east; Śimyu and Kavaṣa
are doubtful; and the Vaikarṇau prob-
ably belonged to the north-west.</F>
<F>4) This is uncertain; the text of the
Rigveda, vii. 18, 6, has Yakṣu, and
the same word recurs in verse 19. On
the other hand, the word Yadu would
naturally be expected in verse 6, as Tur-
vaśa is mentioned. Zimmer, {%Altindisches%}
{%Leben,%} 122, says that Yadu occurs in
vii. 18, but on p. 126 he cites Yakṣu
in both places, evidently by oversight.
Hopkins, {%Journal of the American Oriental%}
{%Society,%} 15, 261, n., considers that Tur-
vaśa, the Yakṣu, is a sarcastic expres-
sion, instead of Turvaśa, the Yadu,
making Turvaśa, whom he regards as
king of the Yadus, ridiculous as a
member of an insignificant people, and
alluding to him also as a sacrificial
victim (as it were, {%yaṣṭavya,%} ‘to be
offered’; {%of puroḍāś,%} ‘cake of sacrifice,’
in verse 6, as a pun on {%purogās,%} ‘leader’).
Whether Yakṣu is used contemptuously
for Yadu or not, it seems hard not to
believe that the Yadus are referred
to.</F>

<L>1206<pc>1-327<k1>trasadasyu<k2>trasadasyu
{@Trasa-dasyu,@}¦ son of {@Purukutsa,@}<sup>1</sup> is mentioned in the Rigveda
as king of the Pūrus.<sup>2</sup> He was born to Purukutsa by his wife,
{@Purukutsānī,@} at a time of great distress;<sup>3</sup> this, according to
Sāyaṇa, refers to Purukutsa's captivity: possibly his death is
really meant. Trasadasyu was also a descendant of Girikṣit,<sup>4</sup>
and Purukutsa was a descendant of Durgaha. The genealogy,
therefore, appears to be: Durgaha, Girikṣit, Purukutsa, Trasa-
dasyu. Trasadasyu was the ancestor of {@Tṛkṣi,@}<sup>5</sup> and, according
to Ludwig,<sup>6</sup> had a son Hiraṇin. Trasadasyu's chronological
position is determined by the fact that his father, Purukutsa,
was a contemporary of Sudās, either as an opponent<sup>7</sup> or as
a friend.<sup>8</sup> That Purukutsa was an enemy of Sudās is more
probable, because the latter's predecessor, Divodāsa, was
apparently<sup>9</sup> at enmity with the Pūrus, and in the battle of the
ten kings Pūrus were ranged against Sudās and the Tṛtsus.
Trasadasyu himself seems to have been an energetic king.
His people, the Pūrus, were settled on the {@Sarasvatī,@}<sup>10</sup> which
was, no doubt, the stream in the middle country, that locality
according well with the later union of the Pūrus with the
{@Kuru@} people, who inhabited that country. This union is
exemplified in the person of {@Kuruśravaṇa,@} who is called
Trāsadasyava, ‘descendant of Trasadasyu,’ in the Rigveda,<sup>11</sup>
whose father was {@Mitrātithi,@} and whose son was {@Upamaśravas.@}
The relation of Mitrātithi to Tṛkṣi does not appear.
<div n="P"/>Another descendant of Trasadasyu was {@Tryaruṇa Traivṛṣṇa,@}
who is simply called Trasadasyu in a hymn of the Rigveda.<sup>12</sup>
[Page1-328+ 50]
He was not only a ‘descendant of Trivṛṣan,’ but, according
to the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>13</sup> he was also Traidhātva,
‘descendant of Tridhātu.’ The order of these two predecessors
of Tryaruṇa cannot be determined in any way from Vedic
literature. According to the later tradition,<sup>14</sup> a prince named
Tridhanvan preceded Tryaruṇa in the succession. Vedic tradi-
tion further fails to show in what precise relation Trasadasyu
stood to Trivṛṣan or Tryaruṇa.
<div n="P"/>Trasdasyu Paurukutsa appears in several Brāhmaṇas<sup>15</sup> as a
famous sacrificer of ancient times, together with {@Para Āṭṇāra,@}
{@Vītahavya Śrāyasa,@} and {@Kakṣīvant Auśija,@} who in the
Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa<sup>16</sup> are called ‘ancient great
kings’ ({%pūrve mahārājāḥ%}).

whose generosity to a singer is celebrated in a hymn of the
Rigveda.<sup>1</sup> In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> he appears as
{@Tryaruṇa Traidhātva Aikṣvāka,@} and is the hero of the
following story. He was out in his chariot with his Purohita,
or domestic priest, {@Vṛśa Jāna,@} and by excessive speed in driving
killed a Brahmin boy. This sin was atoned for by the Puro-
hita's using his Vārśa Sāman (chant). The Śāṭyāyana Brāh-
maṇa, cited by Sāyaṇa,<sup>3</sup> elaborates the tale. As Vṛśa had
held the reins, king and priest accused each other of the murder.
The Ikṣvākus being consulted threw the responsibility for the
crime on Vṛśa, who thereupon revived the boy by the Vārśa
Sāman. In consequence of this unfairness of theirs — being
Kṣatriyas they were partial to a Kṣatriya — Agni's glow ceased
to burn in their houses. In response to their appeal to restore
it, Vṛśa came to them, saw the Piśācī (demoness), who, in the
form of Trasadasyu's wife, had stolen the glow, and succeeded
in restoring it to Agni. This version with some variations
occurs also in the Bṛhaddevatā,<sup>4</sup> which connects the story with
a hymn of the Rigveda.<sup>5</sup> Sieg's attempt<sup>6</sup> to show that the
hymn really refers to this tale is not at all successful.<sup>7</sup>
[Page1-333+ 44]
<div n="P"/>It is clear that Trasadasyu must here mean ‘descendant of
Trasadasyu,’ and not King Trasadasyu himself. The difference
of the patronymics, Traivṛṣṇa and Traidhātva, by which he is
referred to can best be explained by assuming that there were
two kings, Trivṛṣan and Tridhātu (or possibly Tridhanvan),
from whom Tryaruṇa was descended.<sup>8</sup> The connexion with the
Ikṣvākus is important (see {@Ikṣvāku@}).

‘Praises of Gifts,’ in the Rigveda immensely exaggerate these
donations, and the exaggeration grows in the Brāhmaṇas. It
is important to notice that these enumerations of gifts in the

kine, horses, buffaloes, or camels ({%uṣṭra%}), ornaments, and so
forth, but not land.<sup>5</sup> Reference is, however, made in the
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>6</sup> to land as a Dakṣiṇā, but with dis-
approval, probably because the land came to be regarded as
inalienable without the consent of the clansmen.<sup>7</sup>

{@Daśan,@}¦ ‘ten,’ forms the basis of the numerical system of the
Vedic Indians, as it does of the Āryan people generally. But
it is characteristic of India<sup>1</sup> that there should be found at a
very early period long series of names for very high numerals,
whereas the Āryan knowledge did not go beyond 1,000. In
the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>2</sup> the list is 1; 10; 100; 1,000; 10,000
({%ayuta%}); 100,000 ({%niyuta%}); 1,000,000 ({%prayuta%}); 10,000,000 ({%arbuda%});
100,000,000 ({%nyarbuda%}); 1,000,000,000 ({%samudra%}); 10,000,000,000
({%madhya%}); 100,000,000,000 ({%anta%}); 1,000,000,000,000 ({%parārdha%}).
In the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>3</sup> the list is the same, but {%niyuta%} and
{%prayuta%} exchange places, and after {%nyarbuda%} a new figure
({%badva%}) intervenes, thus increasing {%samudra%} to 10,000,000,000,
and so on. The Taittirīya Saṃhitā has in two places<sup>4</sup> exactly
the same list as the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā. The Maitrāyaṇī
Saṃhitā<sup>5</sup> has the list {%ayuta, prayuta,%} then {%ayuta%} again, {%arbuda,%}
{%nyarbuda, samudra, madhya, anta, parārdha.%} The Pañcaviṃśa
Brāhmaṇa<sup>6</sup> has the Vājasaneyi list up to {%nyarbuda%} inclusive,
then follow {%nikharvaka, badva, akṣita,%} and apparently {%go%} =
1,000,000,000,000. The Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa<sup>7</sup> list
[Page1-343+ 58]
replaces {%nikharvaka%} by {%nikharva, badva%} by {%padma,%} and ends
with {%akṣitir vyomāntaḥ.%} The Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra<sup>8</sup> con-
tinues the series after {%nyarbuda%} with {%nikharvāda, samudra,%}
{%salila, antya, ananta%} (= 10 billions).
<div n="P"/>But beyond {%ayuta%}<sup>9</sup> none of these numbers has any vitality.
{%Badva,%} indeed, occurs in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>10</sup> but it
cannot there have any precise numerical sense;<sup>11</sup> and later on
the names of these high numerals are very much confused.
<div n="P"/>An arithmetical progression of some interest is found in the
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>12</sup> where occurs a list of sacrificial gifts
in which each successive figure doubles the amount of the
preceding one. It begins with {%dvādaśa-mānaṃ hiraṇyam,%} ‘gold
to the value of 12’ (the unit being uncertain, but probably the
{@Kṛṣṇala@}),<sup>13</sup> followed by ‘to the value of 24, 48, 96, 192, 384,
768, 1,536, 3072,’ then {%dve aṣṭāviṃśati-śata-māne,%} which must
mean 2×128×24 (the last unit being not a single {%māna,%} but
a number of 24 {%mānas%}) = 6,144, then 12,288, 24,576, 49,152,
98,304, 196,608, 393, 216. With these large numbers may be
compared the minute theoretical subdivision of time found
in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>14</sup> where a day is divided into
15 {%muhūrtas%} — 1 {%muhūrta%} = 15 {%kṣipras,%} 1 {%kṣipra%} = 15 {%etarhis,%}
1 {%etarhi%} = 15 {%idānis,%} 1 {%idāni%} = 15 {%prāṇas.%} The Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta
Sūtra<sup>15</sup> has a decimal division of the day into 15 {%muhūrtas%} — 
1 {%muhūrta%} = 10 {%nimeṣas,%} 1 {%nimeṣa%} = 10 {%dhvaṃsis.%}
<div n="P"/>Few fractions are mentioned in Vedic literature. {%Ardha,%}
{%pāda, śapha,%} and {%kalā%} denote (1/2), (1/4), (1/8), (1/16) respectively, but only
[Page1-344+ 61]
the first two are common. {%Tṛtīya%} denotes the third part.<sup>16</sup>
In the Rigveda<sup>17</sup> Indra and Viṣṇu are said to have divided
1,000 by 3, though how they did so is uncertain. {%Tri-pād%}
denotes ‘three-fourths.’<sup>18</sup>
<div n="P"/>There is no clear evidence that the Indians of the Vedic

{@Dasyu,@}¦ a word of somewhat doubtful origin, is in many
passages of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> clearly applied to superhuman
enemies. On the other hand, there are several passages in
which human foes, probably the aborigines, are thus designated.
This may be regarded as certain in those passages where the
Dasyu is opposed to the Āryan, who defeats him with the aid
of the gods.<sup>2</sup> The great difference between the Dasyus and
the Āryans was their religion: the former are styled ‘not
sacrificing,’ ‘devoid of rites,’ ‘addicted to strange vows,’ ‘god-
hating,’ and so forth.<sup>3</sup> As compared with the {@Dāsa,@} they are
less distinctively a people: no clans ({%viśaḥ%}) of the Dasyus are
mentioned, and while Indra's {%dasyu-hatya,%} ‘slaughter of the
Dasyus,’ is often spoken of, there is no corresponding use of
{%dāsa-hatya.%} That the Dasyus were real people is, however,
shown by the epithet {%anās%} applied to them in one passage of the
Rigveda.<sup>5</sup> The sense of this word is not absolutely certain: the
Pada text and Sāyaṇa both take it to mean ‘without face’ ({%an-ās%}),<sup>6</sup>
but the other rendering, ‘noseles’ ({%a-nās%}), is quite possible,<sup>7</sup>
<div n="P"/>4 Rv. i. 51, 5, 6; 103, 4; x. 95, 7;

slaying,’ i. 100, 12; vi. 45, 24; viii. 76,
11; 77, 3; x. 47, 4 (all of Indra);
vi. 16, 15; viii. 39, 8 (of Agni), etc.
[Page1-348+ 68]
and would accord well with the flat-nosed aborigines of the
Dravidian<sup>8</sup> type, whose language still persists among the Brahuis,
who are found in the north-west. This interpretation would
receive some support from Vṛtra's being called ‘broken-nosed’
if this were a correct explanation of the obscure word {%rujānās.%}<sup>9</sup>
<div n="P"/>The other epithet of the Dasyus is {%mṛdhra-vāc,%} which
occurs with {%anās,%}<sup>10</sup> and which has been rendered<sup>11</sup> ‘of stam-
mering, or unintelligible speech.’ This version is by no
means certain, and since the epithet is elsewhere<sup>12</sup> applied
to Āryans, its correct meaning is more probably ‘of hostile
speech.’
<div n="P"/>Dasyu corresponds with the Iranian {%daṅhu, daqyu,%} which
denotes a ‘province.’ Zimmer<sup>13</sup> thinks that the original
meaning was ‘enemy,’ whence the Iranians developed the
sense of ‘hostile country,’ ‘conquered country,’ ‘province,’
while the Indians, retaining the signification of ‘enemy,’ ex-
tended it to include demon foes. Roth<sup>14</sup> considers that the
meaning of human enemy is a transfer from the strife of gods
[Page1-349+ 59]
and demons. Lassen<sup>15</sup> attempted to connect the contrast
{%daqyu: dasyu%} with that of {%daeva: deva,%} and to see in it a result
of the religious differences which, according to Haug's theory,
had separated the Iranians and the Indians. The word may
have originally meant ‘ravaged land’<sup>16</sup> as a result of invasion;
hence ‘enemies’ country,' then ‘hostile people,’ who as human
foes were more usually called by the cognate name of {@Dāsa.@}
<div n="P"/>Individual Dasyus are {@Cumuri, Śambara, Śuṣṇa,@} etc.
<div n="P"/>In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>17</sup> the word has, as later,<sup>18</sup> the
sense of uncivilized peoples generally.

{@Dāya@}¦ occurs in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> only in the sense of ‘reward’
of exertion ({%śrama%}), but later it means ‘inheritance’ — that is,
a father's property which is to be divided among his sons
either during his lifetime or after his death. The passages all
negative the idea that the property of the family was legally
family property: it is clear that it was the property of the head
of the house, usually the father, and that the other members
of the family only had moral claims upon it which the father
could ignore, though he might be coerced by his sons if they
were physically stronger.
<div n="P"/>Thus {@Manu@} is said in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>2</sup> to have divided
his property among his sons. He omitted {@Nābhānediṣṭha,@}
[Page1-352+ 66]
whom he afterwards taught how to appease the Aṅgirases, and
to procure cows. This is a significant indication that the
property he divided was movable property, rather than land
({@Urvarā@}). In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup> the division is said to
have been made during Manu's lifetime by his sons, who left
only their aged father to Nābhānediṣṭha. According to the
Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>4</sup> again, four sons divided the inheritance
while their old father, Abhipratārin, was still alive. It is,
of course, possible to regard Dāya as denoting the heritable
property of the family, but the developed {%patria potestas%} of the
father, which was early very marked, as shown by the legend
of {@Śunaḥśepa,@} is inconsistent with the view that the sons
were legally owners with their father, unless and until. they
actually insisted on a division of the property.<sup>5</sup> Probably — 
there is no evidence of any decisive character — land was not
divided at first, but no doubt its disposal began to follow the
analogy of cattle and other movable property as soon as the
available supply of arable land became limited.
<div n="P"/>As for the method of division, it is clear from the Taittirīya
Saṃhitā<sup>6</sup> that the elder son was usually preferred; perhaps
[Page1-353+ 50]
this was always the case after death. During the father's life-
time another might be preferred, as appears from a passage
of the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.<sup>7</sup> Women were excluded from
partition or inheritance, according to the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>8</sup>
and the Nirukta.<sup>9</sup> They were, no doubt, supported by their
brothers; but if they had none they might be reduced to prosti-
tution.<sup>10</sup> Detailed rules of inheritance appear in the Sūtras.<sup>11</sup>

{%Communities in India,%} 133 {%et seq.,%} doubts
the existence in early India of such a
{%patria potestas.%} But the facts seem clearly
to show that there was such a power,
and that the father owned the property.
His sons, as they grew up, came to
claim the property, and he might have
to divide it; hence the idea naturally
developed that every child on birth had
a legal share in the property. No doubt
also from the first the right to part with
land was one which grown-up sons and
the rest of the community could object
to, once the village had acquired a fixed
existence. This would account ade-

{@Dāsa,@}¦ like {@Dasyu,@} sometimes denotes enemies of a demoniac
character in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> but in many passages<sup>2</sup> the word
refers to human foes of the Āryans. The Dāsas are described
as having forts ({%puraḥ%}),<sup>3</sup> and their clans ({%viśaḥ%}) are mentioned.<sup>4</sup>
It is possible that the forts, which are called ‘autumnal’
({%śaradīḥ%}),<sup>5</sup> may be mythical, but it is not essential, for the
epithet may allude to their being resorted to in the autumn
season. The Dāsa colour ({@Varṇa@})<sup>6</sup> is probably an allusion to
the black skin of the aborigines, which is also directly men-
tioned.<sup>7</sup> The aborigines (as Dasyus) are called {%anās,%} ‘nose-
less’(?),<sup>8</sup> and {%mṛdhra-vāc,%} ‘of hostile speech,’<sup>9</sup> and are probably
meant by the phallus-worshippers ({%śiśna-devāḥ,%} ‘whose deity
is a phallus’) of the Rigveda.<sup>10</sup> It is significant that constant
[Page1-357+ 67]
reference is made to the differences in religion between Ārva
and Dāsa or Dasyu.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="P"/>Since the Dāsas were in many cases reduced to slavery, the
word Dāsa has the sense of ‘slave’ in several passages of the
Rigveda.<sup>12</sup> Dāsī, the feminine, always has this sense from
the Atharvaveda<sup>13</sup> onwards. Aboriginal women were, no doubt,
the usual slaves, for on their husbands being slain in battle
they would naturally have been taken as servants. They would
sometimes also become concubines; thus {@Kavaṣa@} was taunted
with being the son of a female slave ({%dāsyāḥ putraḥ%}) in the
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>14</sup>
<div n="P"/>Ludwig<sup>15</sup> considers that in some passages<sup>16</sup> Dāsa is applied,
in the sense of ‘enemy,’ to Āryan foes, but this is uncertain.
Zimmer<sup>17</sup> and Meyer<sup>18</sup> think that Dāsa<sup>19</sup> originally meant
‘enemy’ in general, later developing in Iran into the name of
the Dahae<sup>20</sup> of the Caspian steppes, and in India into a desig-
nation of the aborigines. On the other hand, Hillebrandt<sup>21</sup>
argues that, as the Dāsas and the Paṇis are mentioned together,<sup>22</sup>
they must be deemed to be closely related tribes, identifying
[Page1-358+ 51]
the Paṇis with the Parnians and the Dāsas of the Rigveda
with the Dahae. This view, of course, necessitates a transfer
of the scenes of the Rigveda, where Dāsas are prominent, and
especially those in which Divodāsa — ‘the heavenly Dāsa’ — plays
an important part,<sup>23</sup> to the far west. Hillebrandt justifies this
by regarding the scene of the sixth book of the Rigveda as
quite different from that of the seventh and third, in which
Sudās, the Bharatas, Vasiṣṭha, and Viśvāmitra appear. The
Sarasvatī of the sixth book he locates in Arachosia, that of the
seventh in the ‘Middle Country.’ It is, however, extremely
doubtful whether this theory can be upheld. That Divodāsa
should have been a Dāsa, and yet have fought against other
Dāsas, is not in itself likely, especially when his son Sudās
appears as a protagonist of Āryan civilization. It also seems
unreasonable to seek in Arachosia for the river {@Sarasvati,@}
which it is natural to locate in the ‘Middle Country.’
<div n="P"/>The wealth of the Dāsas was no doubt considerable,<sup>24</sup> but in
civilization there is no reason to suppose that they were ever
equal to the invaders.<sup>25</sup> Leading Dāsas were {@Ilībiśa, Cumuri@}
and {@Dhuni, Pipru, Varcin, Śambara.@} For names of aboriginal
tribes, see {@Kirāta, Kīkaṭa, Caṇḍāla, Parṇaka, Śiṃyu.@}

a widow could be regarded as a ‘wooer’ when able to control

{@Div,@}¦ ‘sky.’ The world as a whole is regarded as divided
into the three domains of ‘earth,’ ‘air’ or ‘atmosphere,’ and
‘heaven’ or ‘sky’ ({%div%}),<sup>1</sup> or alternatively into ‘heaven and
earth’ ({%dyāvā-pṛthivī%}),<sup>2</sup> which two are then considered as com-
prising the universe, the atmosphere being included in the sky.
Lightning, wind, and rain belong to the atmosphere, solar and
[Page1-361+ 56]
similar phenomena to the sky. In some passages<sup>3</sup> the vault
({%nāka%}) of the sky is added after the usual triad, and before the
celestial light ({%svar, jyotis%}).
<div n="P"/>The threefold division of the universe is reflected in a three-
fold division of the three elements — earth, air, and sky. Thus
a highest ({%uttama,%}<sup>4</sup> {%uttara,%}<sup>5</sup> {%pārya%}<sup>6</sup> ), a middle, and a lowest
heaven are specified.<sup>4</sup> In the Atharvaveda<sup>7</sup> the three heavens
are distinguished as ‘rich in water’ ({%udanvatī%}), as {%pīlumatī%} (of
uncertain meaning), and as the {%pradyaus,%} where the Fathers sit.
Heaven is frequently called {%vyoman%} as well as {%rocana%}<sup>8</sup> (properly
the ‘luminous space’ of heaven), and the dividing firmament
which separates the visible upper world from the highest
heaven is called, besides {%nāka,%} ‘vault,’ {%sānu,%} ‘summit,’ {%viṣṭap,%}
‘surface,’ and {%pṛṣṭha,%} ‘ridge,’ and even ‘ridge of the vault,’<sup>9</sup> or
‘summit of the vault.’<sup>10</sup>
<div n="P"/>Similarly three atmospheres ({%rajas%}), or oftener two, are
alluded to,<sup>11</sup> but the division here is merely artificial. In one
passage<sup>12</sup> six {%rajāṃsi,%} ‘regions,’ are referred to, the heavens
and the earths no doubt being meant. The usual name for the
atmosphere is {%antarikṣa.%}
<div n="P"/>The three earths are equally artificial, the origin of the triad
being probably the use of {%pṛthivī%} in the plural<sup>13</sup> to denote the
three divisions of the universe (just as {%pitarau,%} ‘two fathers,’
denotes ‘father and mother’).<sup>14</sup> The earth is called {%kṣam, kṣā,%}
{%gmā,%} or designated by the epithets {%mahī,%} ‘the great,’ {%pṛthivī%} or
{%urvī,%} ‘the broad,’ {%uttānā,%} ‘the extended,’ and is regularly con-
trasted as {%idam,%} ‘this world here,’ with the upper sphere.<sup>15</sup>
[Page1-362+ 59]
The shape of the earth is compared with a wheel in the
Rigveda,<sup>16</sup> and is expressly called ‘circular’ ({%pari-maṇḍala%}) in
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>17</sup> When earth is conjoined with
heaven, the two are conceived as great bowls ({%camvā%}) turned
towards each other.<sup>18</sup> In the Aitareya Āraṇyaka<sup>19</sup> the two are
regarded as halves of an egg. The distance of heaven from
the earth is given by the Atharvaveda<sup>20</sup> as a thousand days'
journey for the sun-bird, by the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>21</sup> as a
thousand days' journey for a horse, while the Pañcaviṃśa
Brāhmaṇa<sup>22</sup> whimsically estimates the distance as equivalent
to a thousand cows standing one on the top of the other.
<div n="P"/>According to Zimmer,<sup>23</sup> the Vedic poets conceived the
atmosphere to be above the earth in its upper division only,
but below it in its lower stratum. The evidence,<sup>24</sup> however, for
the latter assumption is quite insufficient.<sup>25</sup> The theory of
the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>26</sup> is that the sun merely reverses its
bright side at night, turning its light on the stars and the moon
while it retraverses its course to the east; and it has been
shown<sup>25</sup> that this is probably the doctrine of the Rigveda also.<sup>27</sup>

See also {@Sūrya@} and {@Candramās.@} For the Vedic knowledge
of the planets, see {@Graha.@}
<div n="P"/>There is no geographical division of the earth in Vedic
literature. The Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa<sup>28</sup> states that
the centre of the earth is a span north of the {@Plakṣa Prāsravaṇā,@}
and that the centre of the sky is the constellation of the seven
Ṛṣis, the Great Bear. For the quarters, see {@Diś.@}

{@Divodāsa Atithigva@}¦ is one of the leading princes of the
early Vedic age. He was a son of Vadhryaśva,<sup>1</sup> and father,
or more probably grandfather, of {@Sudās,@} the famous king of the
{@Tṛtsu@} family, among the {@Bharatas.@} Probably Pijavana was
the son and Sudās the grandson. Divodāsa was naturally a
{@Bharata,@}<sup>2</sup> and, like Sudās, was an opponent of the {@Turvaśas@}
and {@Yadus.@}<sup>3</sup> His great enemy was {@Śambara,@} the {@Dāsa,@} who
was apparently chief of a mountain people,<sup>4</sup> and whom he
repeatedly defeated.<sup>5</sup> He was also, it seems, like his father
Vadhryaśva,<sup>6</sup> an energetic supporter of the fire ritual, for Agni
is once called by his name in the Rigveda.<sup>7</sup> On the other hand,
he was defeated, with {@Āyu@} and {@Kutsa,@} by Indra's aid. In
several passages he seems closely connected with the singer

of Arachosia, and interpreting the name as the ‘heavenly
Dāsa’<sup>11</sup> conjectures that he was himself a Dāsa. This con-
clusion is not probable, for the {@Sarasvatī@} on which the battle
in question took place, and which can hardly be the Haraqaiti
of Arachosia, would naturally designate the later Sarasvatī,

description of {@Purukutsa@} as Durgaha's son, who was either
captured by the enemy or slain, and whose wife, {@Purukutsānī,@}
then obtained a son, {@Trasadasyu,@} to restore the line; he also
quotes a story, not found in the Bṛhaddevatā,<sup>4</sup> to support this
interpretation. On the other hand, the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>5</sup>
seems to take Daurgaha as meaning a horse. Sieg<sup>6</sup> thinks
that the same sense should be adopted in the Rigveda passage,
which he interprets as referring to the sacrifice of a horse,
Daurgaha, by King Purukutsa to gain a son; he also sees in
Dadhikrāvan, with Pischel<sup>7</sup> and Ludwig,<sup>8</sup> a real horse, the
charger of Trasadasyu. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa's inter-
pretation of Daurgaha is, however, doubtful, and cannot be
regarded as receiving support from the case of Dadhikrāvan,
who was probably a divinity, and not a real horse at all.<sup>9</sup>

{@Devāpi Ārṣṭiṣeṇa@}¦ (‘descendant of Ṛṣṭiṣeṇa’) is mentioned
in a hymn of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and in the Nirukta.<sup>2</sup> According to
the latter source there were two brothers, {@Devāpi@} and {@Śantanu,@}
princes of the Kurus. The elder was Devāpi, but Śantanu got
himself anointed king, whereupon no rain fell for twelve years.
The drought being attributed by the Brahmins to his having
superseded his elder brother, Śantanu offered the kingdom to
Devāpi. The latter, however, refused, but acting as Purohita,
or domestic priest, for his brother, obtained rain. The Bṛhad-
devatā<sup>3</sup> tells much the same tale, but adds that the reason for
Devāpi's exclusion from the throne was the fact that he suffered
from a skin disease. The Epic and later legends further
[Page1-378+ 54]
develop the story, presenting two somewhat discrepant accounts.
According to the one version,<sup>4</sup> the ground of Devāpi's being
passed over was leprosy, while in the other his devoting
himself to asceticism in his youth was the cause of his brother's
taking his place. The Epic,<sup>5</sup> moreover, treats him as a son of
Pratīpa, and names as his brothers Bāhlīka<sup>6</sup> and Āṛṣṭiṣeṇa,<sup>7</sup>
who is a new figure developed from the patronymic of Devāpi
Possibly Sieg<sup>8</sup> is right in holding that two stories, those of
Devāpi, Pratīpa's son, and of Devāpi, Ṛṣṭiṣeṇa's son, have been
confused; but in any case it is impossible to extract history
from them.<sup>9</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Rigvedic hymn certainly appears to represent Devāpi
as sacrificing for Śantanu, who seems to be called {@Aulāna.@}<sup>10</sup>
But there is no trace in it of the brotherhood of the two men,
nor is there anything to show that Devāpi was not a Brahmin,
but a Kṣatriya. Sieg,<sup>11</sup> who interprets the hymn by the
Nirukta, thinks that he was a Kṣatriya, but on this occasion
was enabled by the favour of Bṛhaspati to officiate as priest,
and that the hymn shows clear recognition of the unusual
character of his action; but this view seems very improbable.

last act of the funeral rite included the removal of the bow from
[Page1-389+ 53]
the right hand of the dead man.<sup>4</sup> The weapon was composed
of a stout staff bent into a curved shape ({%vakra%}),<sup>5</sup> and of a bow-
string ({@Jyā@}) made of a strip of cowhide<sup>6</sup> which joined the ends.
The tips of the bow, when the string was fastened, were called

strung up when needed for shooting.<sup>7</sup> The stages of the
process are given in detail in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā:<sup>8</sup> the

arrow, the bending ({%ā-yam%}) of the bow, and the shooting ({%as%}).

{@Dharma,@}¦<sup>1</sup> {@Dharman,@}<sup>2</sup> are the regular words, the latter in the
Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> and both later,<sup>2</sup> for ‘law’ or ‘custom.’ But there is
very little evidence in the early literature as to the administra-
tion of justice or the code of law followed. On the other hand,
the Dharma Sūtras<sup>3</sup> contain full particulars.
<div n="P"/>(1) {%Criminal Law.%} — The crimes recognized in Vedic litera-
ture vary greatly in importance, while there is no distinction
adopted in principle between real crimes and what now are
regarded as fanciful bodily defects or infringements of merely
[Page1-391+ 80]
conventional practices.<sup>4</sup> The crimes enumerated include the
slaying of an embryo ({%bhrūṇa%}),<sup>5</sup> the slaying of a man ({%vīra%}),<sup>6</sup> and
 the slaying of a Brahmin,<sup>7</sup> a much more serious crime.
Treachery is mentioned in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>8</sup> as being
punishable by death, as it was punished later.<sup>9</sup> But there is no
trace of an organized criminal justice vested either in the
king or in the people. There still seems to have prevailed the
system of wergeld ({@Vaira@}), which indicates that criminal justice
remained in the hands of those who were wronged. In the
Sūtras,<sup>10</sup> on the other hand, the king's peace is recognized as
infringed by crimes, a penalty being paid to him, or, according
to the Brahminical textbooks, to the Brahmins. It may there-
[Page1-392+ 54]
fore reasonably be conjectured that the royal power of jurisdic-
tion steadily increased; the references in the Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa to the king as wielding punishment ({@Daṇḍa@}) confirm
this supposition. Whether, as the analogy of other systems
suggests, the king was assisted in his judicial duties, as he
undoubtedly was later, by assessors, presumably of the Brahmin
caste, cannot be made out clearly.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="P"/>The procedure adopted in deciding cases is quite uncertain.
In the Chāndogya Upaniṣad<sup>12</sup> the ordeal of the red-hot axe is
mentioned as applied in an accusation of theft. It must
apparently be understood to have been inflicted by the direction
of the king. But no other judicial ordeal is known to Vedic
literature (see {@Divya@}). The punishment of theft was in some
cases at least death, probably when the thief was taken red-
handed;<sup>13</sup> in other cases binding to posts was the penalty,<sup>14</sup>
presumably accompanied by the return of the stolen goods. In
the Chāndogya Upaniṣad<sup>15</sup> the list of sins given as apparently
equal in wickedness is stealing gold, drinking spirits, defiling a
Guru's bed, and the murder of a Brahmin.
<div n="P"/>(2) {%Civil Law.%} — There is little recorded as to civil law in
Vedic literature. The relations of the family and the question
of family property are dealt with under {@Urvarā, Kṣetra, Pati;@}
succession and partition of property are treated under {@Dāya.@}
As regards the transfer of chattels — for land as transferable
{%inter vivos%} is hardly yet recognized, save exceptionally as a
sacrificial fee ({@Dakṣiṇā@}), and then disapproved<sup>16</sup> — the recognized
modes are gift ({@Dāna@}) and barter or sale ({@Kraya@}), which includes
exchange. Original acquisition of land was no doubt brought
[Page1-393+ 52]
about by occupation and apportionment among the tribesmen,<sup>17</sup>
while chattels were acquired by taking possession of them,
provided that they were found on one's own land or on
unoccupied land, and did not belong to any other person
originally. The Sūtras<sup>18</sup> contain rules for the disposal of lost
property, which tend to give it to the king, with the deduction
of a percentage for the finder, unless the latter is a Brahmin,
who keeps it all. As for contract, save in regard to money-
lending (for which see {@Ṛṇa@}), practically nothing is to be gathered
from Vedic literature, doubtless because of the primitive
conditions prevailing in that early period. Much of the labour,
which would in a more developed society have been done by
workers for hire, would be performed by slaves ({%cf.%} {@Dāsa,@}
{@Śūdra@}), while the technical workers of the village — of whom
long lists are given in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>19</sup> and the
Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>20</sup> — may have been recompensed not by
any sum based on each piece of work done, but by fixed allow-
ances, much as the village servants are in modern times.<sup>21</sup> But
this must remain a matter of conjecture, and it is uncertain
what exact status the carpenter or smith held in the village.
Similarly it is impossible to trace in the early literature any
legal theory or practice as to torts, but rules as to penalties for
insults appear in the Sūtras.<sup>22</sup>
<div n="P"/>Very little is recorded as to procedure. The list<sup>23</sup> of victims
at the Puruṣamedha, or ‘horse sacrifice,’ includes a {%praśnin,%}
an {%abhi-praśnin,%} and a {%praśna-vivāka,%} in whom it is not un-
reasonable to see the plaintiff, the defendant, and the arbitrator
or judge: the terms may refer to what is probably an early
[Page1-394+ 59]
form of judicial procedure, a voluntary arbitration. The same
idea may be conveyed by the word {%madhyama-śī,%} ‘lying in the
midst,’ which occurs in the Rigveda,<sup>24</sup> and which Roth,<sup>25</sup>
followed by Zimmer,<sup>26</sup> understood to mean an arbitrator or
judge, the expression being derived from the judge acting with
other judicial persons,<sup>27</sup> and being surrounded by the assembly
of the people. But this interpretation is uncertain; Whitney<sup>28</sup>
thinks that the word merely alludes to a chief round whom
his men encamp. The king is later the chief civil judge, and
may presumably have been so earlier, no doubt in conjunction
with the elders of the tribe, but for this we are reduced to
conjecture.<sup>29</sup>
<div n="P"/>The use of witnesses as evidence is uncertain (see {@Jñātṛ@}),
and the ordeal is not recorded as deciding any civil matter
except the dispute between {@Vatsa@} and his rival as to the true
Brahminical descent of the former, which was settled by his
walking unharmed through the flame of a fire.<sup>30</sup> But it is
probable on analogy that the ordeal may have been used for
the purpose of deciding disputes. Whether the oath was
so used cannot be certainly shown. It appears, however, that
a Brahmin was preferred in legal matters to a non-Brahmin.<sup>31</sup>
<div n="P"/>There are very few references to police officials: no doubt
the king employed some of his dependents to execute sentences
and arrest offenders (see {@Ugra, Jīvagṛbh@}).
<div n="P"/>(3) {%Morality.%} — It is convenient to notice under this head
[Page1-395+ 61]
several points bearing on the moral condition of the people:
({%a%}) the exposure of children; ({%b%}) the exposure of the aged;
({%c%}) prostitution; ({%d%}) adultery; ({%e%}) incest.
<div n="P"/>({%a%}) The exposure of girl infants is asserted by Zimmer<sup>32</sup> on
the strength of a passage in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā,<sup>33</sup> but it
seems clear that the passage has been misunderstood,<sup>34</sup> and
that it refers merely to laying the child aside, not exposing it,
while a boy was lifted up. It is, however, true that the birth
of a girl was not at all popular, not an unnatural sentiment in
an early society, and paralleled among other Āryan peoples.<sup>35</sup>
<div n="P"/>({%b%}) The exposure of the aged is also inferred by Zimmer<sup>36</sup>
from a passage of the Rigveda,<sup>37</sup> and from the mention of
persons exposed ({%ud-hitāḥ%}) in the Atharvaveda.<sup>38</sup> The latter
passage may well refer merely to the bodies being exposed
after death to the elements (as is done by the Parsis). The
former passage merely refers to the individual case of some
person who may have been cast out, and proves absolutely
nothing as to a habitual or recognized custom, nor can such a
custom be inferred from, {%e.g.,%} the legend of {@Cyavāna.@}
<div n="P"/>({%c%}) That prostitution existed in Rigvedic times is certain,
but its extent is disputed. Brotherless girls were frequently
reduced to becoming prostitutes;<sup>39</sup> the putting away of an
illegitimate child is referred to in the Rigveda;<sup>40</sup> besides the
[Page1-396+ 61]
terms {%puṃścalī%}<sup>41</sup> and {%mahānagnī,%}<sup>42</sup> which undoubtedly mean
‘harlot,’ there are other clear references to prostitution;<sup>43</sup> and
expressions like {%kumārī-putra,%} ‘son of a maiden,’<sup>44</sup> and the
‘son of an unmarried girl’ ({%agrū%}), spoken of in the Rigveda<sup>45</sup>
as exposed and attacked by animals, point in the same
direction. The Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>46</sup> seems to recognize
prostitution as a profession. Pischel<sup>47</sup> sees many references
to Hetairai in the Rigveda, which as Geldner<sup>48</sup> insists reflects in
its imagery the court life of Indian princes. But the correct-
ness of the view of these two scholars on this point is not by
any means certain.<sup>49</sup>
<div n="P"/>({%d%}) Adultery was generally regarded among Āryan peoples
as a serious offence against the husband of the woman affected.
We accordingly find in the legal literature of India traces of
the rule that an adulterer can be slain with impunity if taken
in the act.<sup>50</sup> Weber,<sup>51</sup> however, has adduced some material
indicating an indifference to these matters in Vedic times, and
Ludwig<sup>52</sup> has adopted the same view. But, as Delbrück<sup>53</sup> has
clearly shown, the evidence is not convincing; the cited pre-
scriptions<sup>54</sup> forbidding connexion with another man's wife
during a certain rite do not imply that such connexion would
otherwise be allowed: the ritual of the Varuṇa-praghāsas,<sup>55</sup>
when a wife names her lover or lovers, seems originally to have
been a solemn means of banishing the evil brought on a family
by a wife's fall; {@Yājñavalkya's@} famous saying<sup>56</sup> that no one
[Page1-397+ 48]
cares whether a wife is ‘unchaste’ ({%paraḥ-puṃsā%}) or not is a
mere mistranslation,<sup>57</sup> the expression {%paraḥ-puṃsā%} really mean-
ing ‘removed from the male persons.’ And the uncertainty
asserted in some passages<sup>58</sup> as to origin from a Ṛṣi is not a
sign of doubtful descent, but is due to the fact that Ṛṣihood
was a difficult matter to ascertain. None the less woman's
position was lowered by the prevalence of polygamy, and such
stories as that of Ahalyā and Indra<sup>59</sup> are not compatible with
a very high standard of morality. A similar conclusion is
pointed to by references in the Yajurveda<sup>60</sup> to relations between
the Ārya man and the Śūdrā woman, and by a spell given in
the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad<sup>61</sup> to expiate relations with the
wife of a Śrotriya (Brahmin theologian).
<div n="P"/>({%e%}) Incest was recognized in the marriage of brother and
sister as appears from the legend of Yama and Yamī in the
Rigveda,<sup>62</sup> which clearly shows that such a marriage was not
approved by the feeling of the Vedic age. There is also another
hymn<sup>63</sup> in which reference to such intercourse appears to be
made. Mention is further made in the Rigveda<sup>64</sup> to the
wedlock of Prajāpati and his daughter, which is, however,
interpreted mythologically in the Brāhmaṇas,<sup>65</sup> an interpre-
tation which may be correct. That incest, however, actually
did take place is clear from the Atharvaveda;<sup>66</sup> but even though
the mythological interpretation of the passage were not justi-
fied, no conclusion could be drawn from the hymn as to the
normal occurrence of such relations.

which is, unhappily, far from intelligible. But there is no
ground for supposing that he was a Kuru-Pañcāla king; he
seems rather to have lived at some distance from the Kuru-
Pañcālas. There is no good reason to deny his identity<sup>2</sup> with
the Dhṛtarāṣṭra of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>3</sup> king of {@Kāśi,@} who
was defeated, when he attempted to offer a horse sacrifice, by
{@Sātrājita Śatānīka.@} The fact that the latter was a {@Bharata@}
also points to Dhṛtarāṣṭra's not having been a Kuru-Pañcāla at
all. In the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā he appears as having a dispute
with {@Vaka Dālbhi;@} but even assuming that the latter was
a Pañcāla, there is nothing to hint that the former was a Kuru
or that this dispute is a sign of an early hostility of Kuru and
Pañcāla.<sup>4</sup> It is true that in the Epic {@Śantanu@} and Vicitravīrya

seems to be due, as so often in the Epic, to a confused derange-

{@Dhvasra@}¦ is named with {@Puruṣanti@} in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāh-
maṇa<sup>1</sup> as giving gifts to {@Taranta@} and {@Purumīḍha.@} These two,
being kings, could not<sup>2</sup> properly accept gifts which Brāhmaṇas
alone could accept, but by becoming authors of a verse of the
Rigveda<sup>3</sup> they qualified themselves to accept them. The verse
mentions the names in the dual as {%Dhvasrayoḥ Puruṣantyoḥ,%}
‘from the two, Dhvasra and Puruṣanti.’<sup>4</sup> In the Pañcaviṃśa
Brāhmaṇa<sup>5</sup> the names occur in the dual as {%Dhvasre Puruṣantī,%}
a reading which is confirmed by the Nidāna Sūtra.<sup>6</sup> The
former is necessarily a feminine form, though Sāyaṇa, in his
comment on the passage, explains it as really an irregular
masculine. According to Roth,<sup>7</sup> the feminine is a corruption
based on the dual form in the verse of the Rigveda mentioned
above; but the names may be those of women,<sup>8</sup> as Benfey<sup>9</sup>
[Page1-408+ 47]
inclines to believe. Weber<sup>10</sup> suggests that the two were
demons, but this is, as Sieg<sup>11</sup> shows, quite unnecessary.
Dhvasra is no doubt identical with {@Dhvasanti.@}

<L>1474<pc>1-409<k1>nakzatra<k2>nakzatra
{@Nakṣatra@}¦ is a word of obscure origin and derivation. The
Indian interpreters already show a great divergence of opinion
as to its primary meaning. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> re-
solves it into {%na-kṣatra%} (‘no power’), explaining it by a legend.
The Nirukta<sup>2</sup> refers it to the root {%nakṣ,%} ‘obtain,’ following the
Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>3</sup> Aufrecht<sup>4</sup> and Weber<sup>5</sup> derived it from
{%nakta-tra,%} ‘guardian of night,’ and more recently<sup>6</sup> the derivation
from {%nak-kṣatra,%} ‘having rule over night,’ seems to be gaining
acceptance. The generic meaning of the word therefore seems
to be ‘star.’
<div n="P"/>{%The Nakṣatras as Stars in the Rigveda and Later.%} — The sense
of ‘star’ appears to be adequate for all or nearly all the passages
in which Nakṣatra occurs in the Rigveda.<sup>7</sup> The same sense
occurs in the later Saṃhitās also: the sun and the Nakṣatras are
mentioned together,<sup>8</sup> or the sun, the moon, and the Nakṣatras,<sup>9</sup>
or the moon and the Nakṣatras,<sup>10</sup> or the Nakṣatras alone;<sup>11</sup>
[Page1-410+ 55]
but there is no necessity to attribute to the word the sense of
‘lunar mansion’ in these passages.
<div n="P"/>On the other hand, the names of at least three of the
Nakṣatras in the later sense occur in the Rigveda. Tiṣya,<sup>12</sup>
however, does not seem to be mentioned as a lunar mansion.
With {@Aghās@} (plur.) and {@Arjunī@} (dual)<sup>13</sup> the case is different:
it seems probable that they are the later lunar mansions called
Maghās (plur.) and Phalgunī (dual). The names appear to
have been deliberately changed in the Rigveda, and it must be
remembered that the hymn in which they occur, the wedding
hymn of Sūryā, has no claim to great age.<sup>14</sup> Ludwig<sup>15</sup> and
Zimmer<sup>16</sup> have seen other references to the Nakṣatras as
27 in the Rigveda,<sup>17</sup> but these seem most improbable. Nor
do the adjectives {%revatī%} (‘rich’) and {%punarvasā%} (‘bringing
wealth again’) in another hymn<sup>18</sup> appear to refer to the
Nakṣatras.
<div n="P"/>{%The Nakṣatras as Lunar Mansions.%} — In several passages of the
later Saṃhitās the connexion of the moon and the Nakṣatras
is conceived of as a marriage union. Thus in the Kāṭhaka<sup>19</sup>
and Taittirīya Saṃhitās<sup>20</sup> it is expressly stated that Soma was
wedded to the mansions, but dwelt only with Rohiṇī; the
others being angry, he had ultimately to undertake to live with
them all equally. Weber<sup>21</sup> hence deduced that the Nakṣatras
were regarded as of equal extent, but this is to press the texts
unduly, except in the sense of approximate equality. The
number of the mansions is not stated as 27 in the story told in
the two Saṃhitās: the Taittīriya has 33, and the Kāṭhaka no
[Page1-411+ 56]
number; but 27 appears as their number in the list which is
found in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>22</sup> and elsewhere.<sup>23</sup> The
number 28 is much less well attested: in one passage of the
Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>24</sup> Abhijit is practically marked as a new
comer, though in a later book,<sup>25</sup> in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā,<sup>26</sup>
and in the Atharvaveda list,<sup>27</sup> it has found acceptance. It is
perfectly possible that 28 is the earlier number, and that Abhijit
dropped out because it was faint, or too far north, or because
27 was a more mystic (3×3×3) number: it is significant that
the Chinese Sieou and the Arabic Manāzil are 28 in number.<sup>28</sup>
Weber,<sup>29</sup> however, believes that 27 is the older number in
India.
<div n="P"/>The meaning of the number is easily explained when it is
remembered that a periodic month occupies something between
27 and 28 days, more nearly the former number. Such a month
is in fact recognized in the Lāṭyāyana<sup>30</sup> and Nidāna Sūtras<sup>31</sup>
as consisting of 27 days, 12 months making a year of 324 days,
a Nakṣatra year, or with an intercalary month, a year of
351 days. The Nidāna Sūtra<sup>32</sup> makes an attempt to introduce
the Nakṣatra reckoning into the civil or solar ({%sāvana%}) year
of 360 days, for it holds that the sun spends 13(1/3) days in
each Nakṣatra (13(1/3)×27 = 360). But the month of 27 or
28 days plays no part in the chronological calculations of the
Veda.<sup>33</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%The Names of the Nakṣatras.%} — In addition to the two men-
tioned in the Rigveda, the earlier Atharvaveda<sup>34</sup> gives the
[Page1-412+ 61]
names of Jyeṣṭhaghnī<sup>35</sup> (the later Jyeṣṭhā) and Vicṛtau,<sup>36</sup> which
are mentioned as in close connexion, and of Revatīs (plural)
and Kṛttikās.<sup>37</sup> With reference to possible times for the
ceremony of the Agnyādhāna, or ‘laying of the sacred fires,’
the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā,<sup>38</sup> the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā,<sup>39</sup> and the
Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>40</sup> mention the Nakṣatras called Kṛttikās,
Rohiṇī, Phalgunyas, Hasta; the latter Brāhmaṇa adds Punar-
vasū, and in an additional remark<sup>41</sup> excludes Pūrve Phalgunī
in favour of Uttare Phalgunī. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>42</sup>
adds Mṛgaśīrṣa and Citrā as possibilities. On the other hand,
Punarvasū is recommended by all authorities<sup>43</sup> as suitable for
the Punarādheya, ‘relaying of the sacred fires,’ which takes
place if the first fire has failed to effect the aim of its existence,
the prosperity of the sacrificer.<sup>44</sup> The Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā,<sup>45</sup>
however, allows Anurādhās also.
<div n="P"/>In the ceremony of the Agnicayana, or ‘piling of the fire-
altar,’ the bricks are assumed to be equal in number to the
Nakṣatras. The bricks number 756, and they are equated to
27 Nakṣatras multiplied by 27 secondary Nakṣatras, reckoned
as 720 (instead of 729), with the addition of 36 days, the length
of an intercalary month. Nothing can be usefully derived
from this piece of priestly nonsense.<sup>46</sup> But in connexion with
this ceremony the Yajurveda Saṃhitās<sup>47</sup> enumerate the 27
[Page1-413+ 50]
Nakṣatras, and these lists<sup>48</sup> may be given {%in extenso%} as

<div n="P"/>The Taittirīya Brahmaṇa<sup>49</sup> has a list of the Nakṣatras
which agrees generally with the list of the Saṃhitās. It runs
as follows: Kṛttikās, Rohiṇī, Invakās, Bāhū (dual), Tiṣya,
Āśleṣās, Maghās, Pūrve Phalgunī, Uttare Phalgunī, Hasta,
Citrā, Niṣṭyā, Viśākhe, Anūrādhās, Rohiṇī, Mūlabarhaṇī,
Pūrvā Aṣāḍhās, Uttarā Aṣāḍhās, Śroṇā, Śraviṣṭhās, Śatabhiṣaj,
Pūrve Proṣṭhapadās, Uttare Proṣṭhapadās, Revatī, Aśvayujau,
Apabharaṇīs. In a later book,<sup>50</sup> however, the list grows to 28,
[Page1-414+ 50]
and the full moon is inserted after number 14, and the new
moon after number 28, as an attempt to bring the Nākṣatra
(lunar) month into accordance with the Sāvana (solar) month
of 30 days. The names in this second list are as in the
Saṃhitās with the following exceptions. The seven stars of
the Kṛttikās are named as Ambā, Dulā, Nitatnī, Abhrayantī,
Meghayantī, Varṣayantī, Cupuṇīkā, names found also in the
Taittirīya<sup>51</sup> and Kāṭhaka Saṃhitās.<sup>52</sup> Beside Mṛgaśīrṣa, Invakās
are also mentioned.<sup>53</sup> Then come Ārdrā, Punarvasū, Tiṣya,
Āśreṣās, Maghās (beside which Anaghās, Agadās, and Arun-
dhatīs are also mentioned), Phalgunyas (but elsewhere in the
dual, Phalgunyau),<sup>54</sup> Phalgunyas, Hasta, Citrā, Niṣṭyā, Viśākhe,
Anūrādhās, Jyeṣṭhā, Mūla, Aṣāḍhās, Aṣāḍhās, Abhijit, Śronā,
Śraviṣṭhās, Śatabhiṣaj, Proṣṭhapadās, Proṣṭhapadās, Revatī,
Aśvayujau, Bharaṇyas, but also Apabharaṇīs.<sup>55</sup> Abhijit, which
occurs also in an earlier part of the Brāhmaṇa,<sup>56</sup> is perhaps
interpolated. But Weber's<sup>57</sup> argument that Abhijit is out of
place in this list because Brāhmaṇa is here mentioned as the
28th Nakṣatra, loses some force from the fact (of course unknown
to him) that the list in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā<sup>58</sup> contains
28 Nakṣatras, including Abhijit, and adds Brāhmaṇa at the end
as another.
<div n="P"/>In another passage<sup>59</sup> the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa divides the
Nakṣatras into two sets, the Deva Nakṣatras and the Yama
Nakṣatras, being 1-14 and 15-27 (with the omission of Abhijit)
respectively. This division corresponds with one in the third
book of the Brāhmaṇa<sup>60</sup> where the days of the light half of
the month and those of the dark half are equated with the
Nakṣatras. The Brāhmaṇa treats the former series as south,
the latter as north; but this has no relation to facts, and
can only be regarded as a ritual absurdity.
<div n="P"/>The late nineteenth book of the Atharvaveda contains a
list<sup>61</sup> of the Nakṣatras, including Abhijit. The names here
[Page1-415+ 53]
given are: Kṛttikās, Rohiṇī, Mṛgaśiras, Ārdrā, Punarvasū,
Puṣya, Āśleṣās, Maghās, Pūrvā Phalgunyau ({%sic%}),<sup>62</sup> Hasta,
Citrā, Svāti (masc.),<sup>63</sup> Viśākhe, Anurādhā,<sup>64</sup> Jyeṣṭhā, Mūla,
Pūrvā Aṣāḍhās,<sup>65</sup> Uttarā Aṣāḍhās, Abhijit, Śravaṇa, Śraviṣṭhās,
Śatabhiṣaj, Dvayā Proṣṭhapadā, Revatī, Aśvayujau, Bharaṇyas.
<div n="P"/>{%The Position of the Nakṣatras.%} — There is nothing definite in
Vedic literature regarding the position of most of the Nakṣatras,
but the later astronomy precisely locates all of them, and its
statements agree on the whole satisfactorily with what is said
in the earlier texts, though Weber<sup>66</sup> was inclined to doubt this.

Brāhmaṇa,<sup>84</sup> however, constructs an asterismal Prajāpati,
giving him Citrā (<lang n="greek">α</lang> Virginis) for head, Hasta (Corvus) for
hand, the Viśākhe (<lang n="greek">α</lang> and <lang n="greek">β</lang> Libræ) for thighs, and the
Anurādhās (<lang n="greek">β, δ,</lang>, and <lang n="greek">π</lang> Scorpionis) for standing place, with

systems have respectively, instead of Arcturus, <lang n="greek">ι, κ</lang>, and <lang n="greek">λ</lang>
Virginis and <lang n="greek">κ</lang> Virginis, which would well fit into the Prajāpati

Whitney<sup>86</sup> is not certain that Niṣṭyā here must mean a star in

support the view that it was a later addition to the system; its
occurrence, however, as early as the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā,<sup>91</sup>
which he does not note, somewhat invalidates<sup>92</sup> that view. In
the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>93</sup> Abhijit is said to be ‘over Aṣāḍhās,

space, inferring thence that its Vedic position corresponded to
that of the Arab Manāzil and the Chinese Sieou — viz., <lang n="greek">α, β</lang>
Capricorni. But Whitney<sup>95</sup> argues effectively that the words
‘over’ and ‘under’ really refer to the place of Abhijit in the
list, ‘after’ Aṣāḍhās and ‘before’ Śroṇā.

Nakṣatra names are regularly used to denote dates. This is
done in two ways. The name, if not already a feminine, may
be turned into a feminine and compounded with {%pūrṇa-māsa,%}
‘the full moon,’ as in {%Tiṣyā-pūrṇamāsa,%} ‘the full moon in the
Nakṣatra Tiṣya.’<sup>103</sup> Much more often, however, it is turned
into a derivative adjective, used with {%paurṇamāsī,%} ‘the full

moon (night),’ or with {%amāvāsyā,%} ‘the new moon (night),’ as in
{%Phālgunī paurṇamāsī,%} ‘the full-moon night in the Nakṣatra
Phalgunī’;<sup>104</sup> or, as is usual in the Sūtras, the Nakṣatra adjec-
tive alone is used to denote the full-moon night. The month

speaking, these should be lunar months, but the use of a lunar
year was clearly very restricted: we have seen that as early as
the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa there was a tendency to equate lunar
months with the twelve months of thirty days which made up
the solar year (see {@Māsa@}).
<div n="P"/>{%The Nakṣatras and Chronology.%} — (1) An endeavour has been
made to ascertain from the names of the months the period at
which the systematic employment of those names was intro-
duced. Sir William Jones<sup>111</sup> refers to this possibility, and
Bentley, by the gratuitous assumption that Śrāvaṇa always
marked the summer solstice, concluded that the names of the
months did not date before B.C. 1181. Weber<sup>112</sup> considered
that there was a possibility of fixing a date by this means, but
Whitney<sup>113</sup> has convincingly shown that it is an impossible
feat, and Thibaut<sup>114</sup> concurs in this view. Twelve became
fixed as the number of the months because of the desire,
evident in the Brāhmaṇas, somehow or other to harmonize
lunar with solar time; but the selection of twelve Nakṣatras
out of twenty-seven as connected with the night of full moon
can have no chronological significance, because full moon at
[Page1-421+ 55]
no period occurred in those twelve only, but has at all periods
occurred in every one of the twenty-seven at regularly re-
current intervals.
<div n="P"/>(2) All the lists of the Nakṣatras begin with Kṛttīkās. It is
only fair to suppose that there was some special reason for this
fact. Now the later list of the Nakṣatras begins with Aśvinī,
and it was unquestionably rearranged because at the time of its
adoption the vernal equinox coincided with the star <lang n="greek">ζ</lang> Piscium
on the border of Revatī and Aśvinī,<sup>115</sup> say in the course of the
sixth century A.D. Weber<sup>116</sup> has therefore accepted the view
that the Kṛttikās were chosen for a similar reason, and the
date at which that Nakṣatra coincided with the vernal equinox
has been estimated at some period in the third millennium B.C.<sup>117</sup>
A very grave objection to this view is its assumption that the
sun, and not the moon, was then regarded as connected with
the Nakṣatras; and both Thibaut<sup>118</sup> and Oldenberg<sup>119</sup> have
pronounced decidedly against the idea of connecting the
equinox with the Kṛttikās. Jacobi<sup>120</sup> has contended that in
the Rigveda<sup>121</sup> the commencement of the rains and the summer
solstice mark the beginning of the new year and the end of the
old, and that further the new year began with the summer
solstice in Phalgunī.<sup>121</sup> He has also referred to the distinction
of the two sets of Deva and Yama Nakṣatras in the Taittirīya
Brāhmaṇa<sup>122</sup> as supporting his view of the connexion of the
sun and the Nakṣatras. But this view is far from satisfactory:
the Rigveda passages cannot yield the sense required except
by translating the word {%dvādaśa%}<sup>123</sup> as ‘the twelfth (month)’
instead of ‘consisting of twelve parts,’ that is, ‘year,’ the accepted
[Page1-422+ 61]
interpretation; and the division of the Nakṣatras is not at all
satisfactorily explained by a supposed connexion with the sun. It
may further be mentioned that even if the Nakṣatra of Kṛttikās
be deemed to have been chosen because of its coincidence with
the vernal equinox, both Whitney<sup>124</sup> and Thibaut<sup>125</sup> are pre-
pared to regard it as no more than a careless variant of the date
given by the Jyotiṣa, which puts the winter solstice in Māgha.
<div n="P"/>(3) The winter solstice in Māgha is assured by a Brāhmaṇa
text, for the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa<sup>126</sup> expressly places it in the
new moon of Māgha ({%māghasyāmāvāsyāyām%}). It is not very
important whether we take this with the commentators<sup>127</sup> as
the new moon in the middle of a month commencing with the
day after full moon in Taiṣa, or, which is much more likely, as
the new moon beginning the month and preceding full moon in
Māgha. The datum gives a certain possibility of fixing an epoch
in the following way. If the end of Revatī marked the vernal
equinox at one period, then the precession of the equinoxes would
enable us to calculate at what point of time the vernal equinox
was in a position corresponding to the winter solstice in Māgha,
when the solstitial colure cut the ecliptic at the beginning of
Śraviṣṭhās. This would be, on the strict theory, in the third
quarter of Bharaṇī, 6(3/4) asterisms removed from Śraviṣṭhās, and
the difference between that and the beginning of Aśvinī=
[Page1-423+ 48]
1(3/4) asterisms = 23(1/3)° (27 asterisms being = 360°). Taking the
starting-point at 499 A.D., the assured period of Varāha Mihira,
Jones<sup>128</sup> arrived at the date B. C. 1181 for the vernal equinox
corresponding to the winter solstice in Māgha — that is, on the
basis of 1° = 72 years as the precession. Pratt<sup>129</sup> arrived at
precisely the same date, taking the same rate of precession and
adopting as his basis the ascertained position in the Siddhāntas
of the junction star<sup>130</sup> of Maghā, <lang n="greek">α</lang> Leonis or Regulus. Davis<sup>131</sup>
and Colebrooke<sup>132</sup> arrived at a different date, B.C. 1391, by
taking as the basis of their calculation the junction star of Citrā,
which happens to be of uncertain position, varying as much as
3° in the different textbooks. But though the twelfth century
has received a certain currency as the epoch of the observation
in the Jyotiṣa,<sup>133</sup> it is of very doubtful value. As Whitney
points out, it is impossible to say that the earlier asterisms
coincided in position with the later asterisms of 13(1/3)° extent
each. They were not chosen as equal divisions, but as groups
of stars which stood in conjunction with the moon; and the
result of subsequently making them strictly equal divisions
was to throw the principal stars of the later groups altogether
out of their asterisms.<sup>134</sup> Nor can we say that the star <lang n="greek">ζ</lang> Piscium
early formed the eastern boundary of Revatī; it may possibly
not even have been in that asterism at all, for it is far remote
from the Chinese and Arabic asterisms corresponding to Revatī.
Added to all this, and to the uncertainty of the starting-point — 
582 A.D., 560 A.D., or 491 A.D. being variants<sup>135</sup> — is the fact that
the place of the equinox is not a matter accurately determin-
able by mere observation, and that the Hindu astronomers of
the Vedic period cannot be deemed to have been very accurate
observers, since they made no precise determination of the
[Page1-424+ 78]
number of days of the year, which even in the Jyotiṣa they do
not determine more precisely than as 366 days, and even
the Sūrya Siddhānta<sup>136</sup> does not know the precession of the
equinoxes. It is therefore only fair to allow a thousand years
for possible errors,<sup>137</sup> and the only probable conclusion to be
drawn from the datum of the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa is that it
was recording an observation which must have been made some
centuries B.C., in itself a result quite in harmony with the
probable date of the Brāhmaṇa literature,<sup>138</sup> say B.C. 800-600.
<div n="P"/>(4) Another chronological argument has been derived from
the fact that there is a considerable amount of evidence for
Phālguna having been regarded as the beginning of the year,
since the full moon in Phalgunī is often described as the
‘mouth ({%mukham%}) of the year.’<sup>139</sup> Jacobi<sup>140</sup> considers that this
[Page1-425+ 54]
was due to the fact that the year was reckoned from the winter
solstice, which would coincide with the month of Phālguna
about B.C. 4000. Oldenberg<sup>141</sup> and Thibaut,<sup>142</sup> on the other
hand, maintain that the choice of Phālguna as the ‘mouth’ of
the year was due to its being the first month of spring. This
view is favoured by the fact that there is distinct evidence<sup>143</sup>
of the correspondence of Phālguna and the beginning of spring:
as we have seen above in the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa, the new
moon in Māgha is placed at the winter solstice,<sup>144</sup> which puts
the full moon of Phalgunī at a month and a half after the
winter solstice, or in the first week of February, a date not in
itself improbable for about B.C. 800, and corresponding with
the February 7 of the {%veris initium%} in the Roman Calendar.
This fact accords with the only natural division of the year
into three periods of four months, as the rainy season lasts from
June 7-10 to October 7-10, and it is certain that the second set
of four months dates from the beginning of the rains (see
{@Cāturmāsya@}). Tilak,<sup>145</sup> on the other hand, holds that the
winter solstice coincided with Māghī full moon at the time of the
Taittirīya Saṃhitā (B.C. 2350), and had coincided with Phālgunī
and Caitrī in early periods — viz., B.C. 4000-2500, and B.C. 6000-
4000.
<div n="P"/>(5) The passages of the Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>146</sup> and the Pañca-
viṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>147</sup> which treat the full moon in Phālguna as
the beginning of the year, give as an alternative the full moon
in Caitra. Probably the latter month was chosen so as to
secure that the initial day should fall well within the season of
spring,<sup>148</sup> and was not, as Jacobi believes, a relic of a period
[Page1-426+ 49]
when the winter solstice corresponded with Caitra. Another
alternative is the Ekāṣṭakā, interpreted by the commentators as
the eighth day after the full moon in Maghās, a time which
might, as being the last quarter of the waning half of the old
year, well be considered as representing the end of the year.
A fourth alternative is the fourth day before full moon; the full
moon meant must be that of Caitra, as Ālekhana quoted by
Āpastamba held, not of Māgha, as Āśmarathya, Laugākṣi and
the Mīmāṃsists believed, and as Tilak believes.<sup>149</sup>
<div n="P"/>(6) Others, again, according to the Gṛhya ritual, began the
year with the month Mārgaśīrṣa, as is shown by its other name
Āgrahāyaṇa<sup>150</sup> (‘belonging to the commencement of the year’).
Jacobi and Tilak<sup>151</sup> think that this one denoted the autumn
equinox in Mṛgaśiras, corresponding to the winter solstice in
Phalgunī. But, as Thibaut<sup>152</sup> shows clearly, it was selected as
the beginning of a year that was taken to commence with
autumn, just as some took the spring to commence with Caitra
instead of Phālguna.<sup>153</sup>
<div n="P"/>(7) Jacobi has also argued, with the support of Bühler,<sup>154</sup>
from the terms given for the beginning of Vedic study in the
Gṛhya Sūtras, on the principle that study commenced with the
rains (as in the Buddhist {%vassā%}) which mark the summer
solstice. He concludes that if Bhādrapada appears as the
date of commencing study in some texts, it was fixed thus
because at one time Proṣṭhapadās (the early name of Bhadra-
padās) coincided with the summer solstice, this having been the
case when the winter solstice was in Phālguna. But Whitney<sup>155</sup>
has pointed out that this argument is utterly illegitimate; we
cannot say that there was any necessary connexion between the
rains and learning — a month like Śrāvaṇa might be preferred
[Page1-427+ 89]
because of its connexion with the word Śravaṇa, ‘ear’ — and
in view of the precession of the equinoxes, we must assume that
Bhādrapada was kept because of its traditional coincidence
with the beginning of the rains after it had ceased actually so
to coincide.<sup>156</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%The Origin of the Nakṣatras.%} — As we have seen, there is no
evidence showing the process by which the Nakṣatras may
[Page1-428+ 52]
have originated in India. They are mentioned only as stars in
the earlier parts of the Rigveda, then the names of three of
them are found in the latest parts of that Saṃhitā, and finally
in the later Atharvaveda and in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās the
full list appears. It may also be noted that the Vedic Indians
show (see {@Graha@}) a remarkably small knowledge of the other
astronomical phenomena; the discovery of a series of 27 lunar
mansions by them would therefore be rather surprising. On
the other hand, the nature of such an operation is not very
complicated; it consists merely in selecting a star or a star
group with which the moon is in conjunction. It is thus
impossible {%a priori%} to deny that the Vedic Indians could have
invented for themselves a lunar Zodiac.<sup>157</sup>
<div n="P"/>But the question is complicated by the fact that there exist
two similar sets of 28 stars or star groups in Arabia and in
China, the Manāzil and the Sieou. The use of the Manāzil in
Arabia is consistent and effective; the calendar is regulated by
them, and the position of the asterisms corresponds best with
the positions required for a lunar Zodiac. The Indians might
therefore have borrowed the system from Arabia, but that is a
mere possibility, because the evidence for the existence of the
Manāzil is long posterior to that for the existence of the
Nakṣatras, while again the Mazzaroth or Mazzaloth of the Old
Testament<sup>158</sup> may really be the lunar mansions.<sup>159</sup> That the
Arabian system is borrowed from India, as Burgess<sup>160</sup> held, is,
on the other hand, not at all probable.
<div n="P"/>Biot, the eminent Chinese scholar, in a series of papers
published by him between 1839 and 1861,<sup>161</sup> attempted to prove
[Page1-429+ 48]
the derivation of the Nakṣatra from the Chinese Sieou. The
latter he did not regard as being in origin lunar mansions at all.
He thought that they were equatorial stars used, as in modern
astronomy, as a standard to which planets or other stars
observed in the neighbourhood can be referred; they were, as
regards twenty-four of them, selected about B.C. 2357 on
account of their proximity to the equator, and of their having
the same right ascension as certain circumpolar stars which had
attracted the attention of Chinese observers. Four more were
added in B.C. 1100 in order to mark the equinoxes and solstices
of the period. He held that the list of stars commenced with
Mao (= Kṛttikās), which was at the vernal equinox in B.C. 2357.
Weber,<sup>162</sup> in an elaborate essay of 1860, disputed this theory,
and endeavoured to show that the Chinese literary evidence for
the Sieou was late, dating not even from before the third
century B.C. The last point does not appear<sup>163</sup> to be correct,
but his objections against the basis of Biot's theory were rein-
forced by Whitney,<sup>164</sup> who insisted that Biot's supposition of
the Sieou's not having been ultimately derived from a system of
lunar mansions, was untenable. This is admitted by the latest
defender of the hypothesis of borrowing from China, Léopold
de Saussure,<sup>165</sup> , but his arguments in favour of a Chinese origin
for the Indian lunar mansions have been refuted by Oldenberg,<sup>166</sup>
who has also pointed out<sup>167</sup> that the series does not begin with
Mao (= Kṛttikās).
<div n="P"/>There remains only the possibility that a common source for
all the three sets — Nakṣatra, Manāzil, and Sieou — may be
found in Babylonia. Hommel<sup>168</sup> has endeavoured to show
that recent research has established in Babylonia the existence
of a lunar zodiac of twenty-four members headed by the
[Page1-430+ 120]
Pleiades (= Kṛttikās); but Thibaut's researches<sup>169</sup> are not
favourable to this claim. On the other hand, Weber,<sup>170</sup>
Whitney,<sup>171</sup> Zimmer,<sup>172</sup> and Oldenberg<sup>173</sup> all incline to the
view that in Babylonia is to be found the origin of the system,
and this must for the present be regarded as the most probable
view, for there are other traces of Babylonian influence in
Vedic literature, such as the legend of the flood, perhaps the
Ādityas,<sup>174</sup> and possibly the word {@Manā.@}

<F>156) Mention should here be made of
the following points: (1) Jacobi's argu-
ment from the word Dhruva, the name
of the star pointed out to the bride in
the marriage ritual. The word does
not occur in the literature anterior to
the Gṛhya Sūtras, and it must remain
an undecided question whether the
practice was or was not old. Jacobi
urges that Dhruva means ‘fixed,’ and
that it must originally have referred to
a real fixed pole star, and he thinks
that such a star could only be found
in the third millennium B.C. Whitney
and Oldenberg definitely reject this
view on the ground that too much
must not be made out of a piece of
folk-lore, and that the marriage ritual
requirements would be satisfied by any
star of some magnitude which was
approximately polar. This conclusion
seems convincing. {%Cf.%} Keith, {%Journal%}
{%of the Royal Asiatic Society,%} 1909, 1102;
1910, 465; {%contra,%} Jacobi, {%ibid.,%} 1909,
726 {%et seq.;%} 1910, 464. (2) The Śata-
patha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 2, 3, asserts
that the Kṛttikās do not move from
the eastern quarter, which the others
do; and stress has been laid (by Jacobi,
{%Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,%} 1910,
463, 464) upon this assertion as giving
a date of the third millennium B.C. for
the Śatapatha observation. But this
notice is quite inadequate to support
any such result, and its lack of trust-
worthiness as a chronological guide is
increased by the fact that the Baudhā-
yana Śrauta Sūtra, xviii 5, has a similar
notice, coupled with another notice,
which, according to Barth, would only
be true somewhere in or after the sixth
century A.D., the equatorial point being
placed between Citrā and Svātī, which
in the early period were both very
much north of the equator (see Caland,
{%Über das rituelle Sūtra des Baudhāyana,%}
37-39). The same passage of the Śata-
patha Brāhmaṇa, ii. 1, 2, 2, in the
Mādhyaṃdina recension, states that
the number of the Kṛttikās is greater
than that of the stars in any of the
other Nakṣatras, which consist of one,
two, three, or four stars, or which,
according to the Kāṇva recension (see
Eggeling, {%Sacred Books of the East,%} 12,
282, n. 2), have four stars. It is not
possible to put much faith in this asser-
tion, for Hasta later has five stars, and
its name (with reference to the fingers)
suggests five ({%cf.%} Weber, {%Naxatra,%} 2,
368, 381), and that number is possibly
referred to in the Rigveda (i. 105, 10).
See Geldner, {%Vedische Studien,%} 3, 177.
(3) Attempts have been made to regard
the names of the Nakṣatras as signifi-
cant of their position in the list. Thus
Bentley, {%Historical View,%} 2, thought
Viśākhā was so called because the
equinoctial colure divided the equator
about 1426 B.C.; this is refuted by
Tilak, {%Orion,%} 57 {%et seq.%} Jyeṣṭhaghnī
has been interpreted as ‘slaying the
eldest’ — {%i.e.,%} as marking the new year
by putting an end to the old year.
Tilak, 90, suggests that Mūla was so
called because its acronycal rising
marked the beginning of the year when
the vernal equinox was near Mṛgaśiras.
More probable is Whitney's view, {%Sārya%}
{%Siddhānta,%} 194, that it was the most
southern, and so, as it were, the basis
of the asterisms.</F>
<F>157) Max Müller, {%Rigveda,%} 4^2, xliv

which makes the longest day fourteen

compared the Babylonian day of four-

view ({%Altindisches Leben,%} 363, 364) of the
division of day and night into thirty
parts, which he sees in Rv. i. 123, 8,
and which he thinks is based on the
Babylonian division of the same period
of time into sixtieths. {%Cf.%} also V. Smith,
{%Indian Antiquary,%} 34, 230, who argues,

<div n="P"/>The facts about the Nakṣatras are
(with the exception of the data from the
Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā and the Baudhā-
yana Śrauta Sūtra) collected in Weber's
second essay, {%Die vedischen Nachrichten%}
{%von den Naxatra,%} 1861. The first essay,
1860, deals with the problem of origins.
See also his discussions in {%Indische%}
{%Studien,%} 9, 424 {%et seq.;%} 10, 213 {%et seq.%}
Whitney's work lies partly in his
scientific determination (in many places
correcting Colebrooke's discoveries) of
the later Naxatras in his edition and
version of the Sūrya Siddhānta ({%Journal%}
{%of the American Oriental Society,%} 6), and
partly in his discussions of the question
of origin ({%Journal of the American Oriental%}
{%Society,%} 8), {%Oriental and Linguistic Essays,%}
2, 341-421 (with a stellar chart), and
of the question of date as against
Jacobi and Tilak's {%Orion%} ({%Journal of%}
{%the American Oriental Society,%} 16, lxxxii
{%et seq.%}). The views of Max Müller are
found in his {%Rigveda,%} 4^2, xxxiv {%et seq.%}
The modern discussion of the dates
inferable from the Nakṣatra was in-
augurated by Jacobi (1893) in the
{%Festgruss an Roth,%} 68-74 (translated in
the {%Indian Antiquary,%} 23). See also his

{@Napāt@}¦ in Vedic literature apparently has both the wider
sense of ‘descendant,’<sup>1</sup> and the narrower one of ‘grandson’ in
the Saṃhitās.<sup>2</sup> In the Brāhmaṇas the word seems hardly to
have the sense of ‘descendant’ at all, while it denotes not
only ‘grandson,’<sup>3</sup> but also ‘great-grandson’ in the sequence
‘sons, grandsons, great-grandsons’ ({%putrān, pautrān, naptṝn%}).<sup>4</sup>
‘Grandson’ is also expressed by Pautra (‘son's son’) in the
Atharvaveda and later,<sup>5</sup> while the sense of ‘great-grandson’ is
accurately conveyed as early as the Rigveda<sup>6</sup> by Pra-ṇapāt,
used beside Napāt, ‘grandson.’ Naptī, the feminine, is practi-
cally limited to the Saṃhitās,<sup>7</sup> and denotes ‘daughter.’ The
use in the Veda throws no light on the original use of the
word.<sup>8</sup>

{@Nābhā-nediṣṭha@}¦ (‘nearest in descent’) {@Mānava@} (‘descendant
of Manu’) is famous in the later Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas<sup>1</sup>
for the way in which he was treated when his father {@Manu@}
divided his property among his sons, or they divided it:
Nābhānediṣṭha was left out, but was solaced by obtaining,
through his father's advice, cows from the Aṅgirases, a feat
which is regarded in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra<sup>2</sup> as on a
level with the exploits of other seers who celebrated their
patrons in hymns, and as giving rise to the hymn, Rigveda x. 62.
Nābhānediṣṭha's hymn is repeatedly mentioned in the Brāh-
maṇas,<sup>3</sup> but beyond its authorship nothing is recorded of him.
In the Saṃhitā<sup>4</sup> itself he seems to be spoken of as a poet in
one passage, which is, however, of quite uncertain meaning.
<div n="P"/>Nābhānediṣṭha is etymologically connected in all probability
with Nabānazdiṣta in the Avesta, which refers to the Fravaṣi
of the paoiryō-ṭkaēsha and the Fravaṣi of the Nabānazdiṣta.
Lassen<sup>5</sup> saw in the legend a reminiscence of an Indo-Iranian
split; but Roth<sup>6</sup> showed conclusively that this was impossible,
and that Nābhānediṣṭha meant simply ‘nearest in birth,’ and
[Page1-443+ 48]
Weber<sup>7</sup> admits that the connexion of the words is not one of
borrowing on either side, but that in the Avesta it has kept its
original sense of ‘nearest relation,’ while in the Rigveda it has
become a proper name.

{@Nāman,@}¦ ‘name,’ is a common word from the Rigveda
onwards. The Gṛhya Sūtras<sup>1</sup> give elaborate rules for the
formation of the names of children, but more important is
the distinction between the secret ({%guhya%}) and the ordinary
name, though the rules as to the secret name are not at all
consistent. The secret name is already recognized in the
Rigveda,<sup>2</sup> and is referred to in the Brāhmaṇas,<sup>3</sup> one secret
name, that of Arjuna for Indra, being given in the Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa.<sup>4</sup> It is to be noted that the rule as to giving the
[Page1-444+ 54]
designation of a Nakṣatra (lunar asterism) as the secret name
or otherwise is not illustrated by a single recorded name of a
teacher in the Brāhmaṇas.<sup>5</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>6</sup> several times mentions the
adoption of a second name with a view to securing success,
and also refers to the adoption of another name for purposes
of distinction.<sup>7</sup>
<div n="P"/>In actual practice two names are usually found in the
Brāhmaṇas, the second being a patronymic or a metronymic,
as in {@Kakṣīvant Auśija@}<sup>8</sup> (if the story of the slave woman Uśij
as his mother is correct), or {@Bṛhaduktha Vāmneya,@}<sup>9</sup> ‘son of
Vāmnī,’ though the relationship may, of course, be not direct
parentage, but more remote descent.<sup>10</sup> Three names are less
common — for example, {@Kūśāmba Svāyava Lātavya,@}<sup>11</sup> ‘son of
Svāyu, of the Lātavya (son of Latu) family,’ or {@Devataras@}
{@Śyāvasāyana Kāśyapa,@}<sup>12</sup> where the patronymic and the Gotra
name are both found. In other cases the names probably
have a local reference — {%e.g.,%} {@Kauśāmbeya@} and {@Gāṅgya.@} Fre-
quently the patronymic only is given, as {@Bhārgava, Maudgalya,@}

Saṃhitā,<sup>3</sup> while distinguishing the two, asserts that both are
false ({%anṛtam%}). It is hardly probable that the two were abso-
lutely distinct, for the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>4</sup> has the phrase
‘a Gāthā celebrating men’ ({%nārāśaṃsī%}). What such verses
were may be seen from the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra,<sup>5</sup> which

The word seems to denote not so much a particular tribe, but
to be the general term for the non-Āryan tribes who were not
under Āryan control, as the Śūdras were, for Aupamanyava<sup>2</sup>
took the five peoples ({%pañca janāḥ%}) to be the four castes ({%catvāro%}

{%varṇāḥ%}) and the Niṣādas, and the commentator Mahīdhara
explains the word where it occurs in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>3</sup>
as meaning a Bhilla, or Bhīl. A village of Niṣādas is men-
tioned in the Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra,<sup>4</sup> and a Niṣāda {@Sthapati,@}
a leader of some kind, is referred to in the Kātyāyana Śrauta
Sūtra<sup>5</sup> and in a Brāhmaṇa cited by the scholiast on that
passage. Weber<sup>6</sup> thinks that the Niṣādas were the settled
aborigines (form {%ni,%} ‘down,’ and {%sad,%} ‘settle’), a view sup-
ported by the fact that the ritual of the Viśvajit sacrifice<sup>7</sup>
requires a temporary residence with Niṣādas; for the Niṣādas
who would permit an Āryan to reside temporarily amongst
them must have been partially amenable to Āryan influence.
But the name might easily be applied to the whole body of
aborigines outside the Āryan organization. Von Schroeder<sup>8</sup>
thinks that the Niṣādas were most probably identical with the
Nysæans, who, according to the Greek account, sent an
embassy to Alexander when he was in the territory of the
Aśvakas, but this identification is doubtful.

{@Nau@}¦ is the regular word in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later<sup>2</sup> for a
‘boat’ or ‘ship.’ In the great majority of cases the ship was
merely a boat for crossing rivers, though no doubt a large boat
was needed for crossing many of the broad rivers of the Panjab
as well as the {@Yamunā@} and {@Gaṅgā.@} Often no doubt the Nau
was a mere dug-out canoe ({%dāru%}).<sup>3</sup> It is certainly against the
theory<sup>4</sup> of the existence in Vedic times of an extensive sea
trade that there is no mention of any of the parts of a ship, such
as masts and sails, except the oar ({@Aritra@}), Yet there are some
allusions indicating a trade more extensive than that implied
by boats used for crossing rivers. The Atharvaveda<sup>5</sup> compares
the ruin of a kingdom where Brahmins are oppressed to the
[Page1-462+ 49]
sinking of a ship which is leaking ({%bhinnā%}); though the language
here employed can be made to fit the theory that the ship was
only a canoe, it cannot naturally be so interpreted. Moreover,
there is mention made in the Rigveda<sup>6</sup> of men who go to the
ocean ({@Samudra@}) eager for gain ({%saniṣyavaḥ%}). It is not altogether
satisfactory to restrict such references with Zimmer<sup>7</sup> to the
broad stream of the Indus after the union of that river with
the tributaries of the Panjab. In the Rigveda<sup>8</sup> too it is said
that the Aśvins rescued {@Bhujyu@} in the ocean with a ship of
a hundred oars ({%śatāritra%}). It is not easy to refuse to recognize
here the existence of larger vessels with many oars used for
sea voyages. The Baudhāyana Dharma Sūtra,<sup>9</sup> at any rate,
clearly refers to maritime navigation. See also {@Samudra.@}

that they were a northern tribe; this is probable, since the
Bharatas seem to have occupied the Madhyadeśa, or ‘Middle
Land.’ In three passages of the Rigveda<sup>5</sup> a Paktha is referred

{@Pañca-janāḥ,@}¦ the ‘five peoples,’ are mentioned under various
names in Vedic literature.<sup>1</sup> Who are meant by the five is very
uncertain. The Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> explains the five to be
gods, men, Gandharvas and Apsarases, snakes, and the Fathers.
[Page1-467+ 60]
Aupamanyava<sup>3</sup> held that the four castes ({@Varṇa@}) and the
{@Niṣādas@} made up the five, and Sāyaṇa<sup>4</sup> is of the same opinion.
Yāska<sup>5</sup> thinks that the five are the Gandharvas, fathers, gods,
Asuras, and Rakṣases. No one of these explanations can be
regarded as probable. Roth<sup>6</sup> and Geldner<sup>7</sup> think that all the
peoples of the earth are méant: just as there are four quarters
({@Diś@}), there are peoples at the four quarters (N. E. S. W.), with
the Āryan folk in the middle. Zimmer<sup>8</sup> opposes this view on
the ground that the inclusion of all peoples in one expression is
not in harmony with the distinction so often made between
Āryan and Dāsa; that neither {%janāsaḥ,%} ‘men,’<sup>9</sup> nor {%mānuṣāḥ,%}
‘people,’<sup>10</sup> could be used of non-Āryans; that the Soma is
referred to as being among the five tribes;<sup>11</sup> that the five tribes
are mentioned as on the {@Sarasvatī,@}<sup>12</sup> and that Indra is {%pāñca-%}
{%janya,%}<sup>13</sup> ‘belonging to the five peoples.’ He concludes that
Āryans alone are meant, and in particular the five tribes of the
{@Anus, Druhyus, Yadus, Turvaśas,@} and {@Pūrus,@} who are all
mentioned together in one or perhaps two hymns of the
Rigveda,<sup>14</sup> and four of whom occur in another hymn.<sup>15</sup> But he
admits that the expression might easily be used more generally
later. Hopkins<sup>16</sup> has combated Zimmer's view, but his own
opinion rests mainly on his theory that there was no people
named Turvaśa, but only a king of the Yadus called Turvaśa,
and that theory is not very probable.

{@Paṇi@}¦ in the Rigveda appears to denote a person who is
rich, but who does not give offerings to the gods, or bestow
{@Dakṣiṇās@} on the priests, and who is therefore an object of
intense dislike to the composers of the Saṃhitā.<sup>1</sup> Hence the
gods are asked to attack the Paṇis, who are also referred to
as being defeated with slaughter.<sup>2</sup> The Paṇi is opposed to the
pious sacrificer as a niggard,<sup>3</sup> and is spoken of as a wolf,<sup>4</sup> the
symbol of enmity. In some passages<sup>5</sup> the Paṇis definitely
appear as mythological figures, demons who withhold the cows
or waters of heaven, and to whom Saramā goes on a mission
from Indra.<sup>6</sup> Among the Paṇis {@Bṛbu@} was apparently important.
In one passage of the Rigveda<sup>7</sup> they are described as {@Beka-@}
{@nāṭas,@} or ‘usurers’ (?). In another<sup>8</sup> they are called {@Dasyus,@}
and styled {%mṛdhra-vāc,%} probably ‘of hostile speech,’ and {%grathin,%}
a word of uncertain meaning. Hillebrandt<sup>9</sup> thinks that the
latter epithet refers to the continuous flow of a speech which
[Page1-472+ 54]
is not understood, and that {%mṛdhra-vāc%} means ‘śpeaking an
enemy's speech,’ though not necessarily with reference to
non-Āryans.<sup>10</sup> In two passages<sup>11</sup> the Paṇis appear as {@Dāsas,@}
and in one<sup>12</sup> a Paṇi is mentioned in connexion with wer-
geld ({@Vaira@}), being apparently regarded as equal to a man
merely in the price put on his life, but in other respects as
inferior.
<div n="P"/>It is difficult to be certain exactly who a Paṇi was. Roth<sup>13</sup>
thinks that the word is derived from {%paṇ,%} ‘barter,’ and that
the Paṇi is properly the man who will give nothing without
return, hence the niggard, who neither worships the gods nor
rewards their priests. This view is accepted by Zimmer<sup>14</sup> and
by Ludwig.<sup>15</sup> The latter scholar thinks the apparent references
to fights with Paṇis are to be explained by their having been
aboriginal traders who went in caravans — as in Arabia and
Northern Africa — prepared to fight, if need be, to protect their
goods against attacks which the Āryans would naturally deem
quite justified. He supports this explanation by the references
to the Paṇis as Dasyus and Dāsas. It is, however, hardly
necessary to do more than regard the Paṇis generally as
non-worshippers of the gods favoured by the singers; the term
is wide enough to cover either the aborigines or hostile Āryan
tribes, as well as demons. Hillebrandt,<sup>16</sup> however, thinks that
a real tribe is meant, the Parnians of Strabo, and that they
were associated with the Dahae ({@Dāsa@}). Moreover, he finds
them associated in one passage<sup>17</sup> with the {@Pārāvatas,@} whom
[Page1-473+ 45]
he identifies with the <lang n="greek">Παρουῆται</lang> of Ptolemy,<sup>18</sup> and with {@Bṛṣaya,@}
whom he connects with <lang n="greek">Βαρσαέντης</lang> of Arrian;<sup>19</sup> he also con-
siders that the frequent<sup>20</sup> mention of the Paṇis as opponents
of {@Divodāsa@} shows that the latter was on the Arachosian
Haraqaiti ({@Sarasvatī@}) fighting against the Parnians and Dahae,
as well as other Iranian tribes. But the identification of Paṇi
and the Parnians is needless, especially as the root {%paṇ,%} which
is found also in the Greek <lang n="greek">πέρνημι</lang>, shows a satisfactory deri-
vation, while the transfer of Divodāsa to the Haraqaiti is
improbable. See also {@Divodāsa@} and {@Bekanāṭa.@}

{@Pati, Patnī.@}¦ — Under these words denoting primarily, as the
evidence collected in the St. Petersburg Dictionary shows,
‘lord’ and ‘lady,’ and so ‘husband’ and ‘wife,’ it is convenient
to consider the marital relations of the Vedic community.
<div n="P"/>{%Child Marriage.%} — Marriage in the early Vedic texts appears
essentially as a union of two persons of full development. This
is shown by the numerous references<sup>1</sup> to unmarried girls who
grow old in the house of their fathers ({%amā-jur%}), and who adorn
themselves in desire of marriage, as well as to the paraphernalia
of spells and potions used in the Atharvavedic tradition<sup>2</sup> to
compel the love of man or woman respectively, while even the
Rigveda<sup>3</sup> itself seems to present us with a spell by which a
[Page1-475+ 60]
lover seeks to send all the household to sleep when he visits his
beloved. Child wives first occur regularly in the Sūtra period,
though it is still uncertain to what extent the rule of marriage
before puberty there obtained.<sup>4</sup> The marriage ritual also quite
clearly presumes that the marriage is a real and not a nominal
one: an essential feature is the taking of the bride to her
husband's home, and the ensuing cohabitation.<sup>5</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%Limitations on Marriage.%} — It is difficult to say with certainty
within what limits marriage was allowed. The dialogue of
Yama and Yamī in the Rigveda<sup>6</sup> seems clearly to point to a
prohibition of the marriage of brother and sister. It can
hardly be said, as Weber<sup>7</sup> thinks, to point to a practice that
was once in use and later became antiquated. In the Gobhila
Gṛhya Sūtra<sup>8</sup> and the Dharma Sūtras<sup>9</sup> are found prohibitions
against marriage in the {@Gotra@} (‘family’) or within six degrees
on the mother's or father's side, but in the Śatapatha Brāh-
maṇa<sup>10</sup> marriage is allowed in the third or fourth generation,
the former being allowed, according to Harisvamin,<sup>11</sup> by the
Kāṇvas, and the second by the Saurāṣṭras, while the Dākṣi-
ṇātyas allowed marriage with the daughter of the mother's
brother or the son of the father's sister, but presumably not
with the daughter of the mother's sister or the son of the
father's brother. The prohibition of marriage within the
Gotra cannot then have existed,<sup>12</sup> though naturally marriages
[Page1-476+ 64]
outside the Gotra were frequent.<sup>13</sup> Similarity of caste was also
not an essential to marriage, as hypergamy was permitted even
by the Dharma Sūtras,<sup>14</sup> so that a Brāhmaṇa could marry
wives of any lower caste, a Kṣatriya wives of the two lowest
castes as well as of his own caste, a Vaiśya a Śūdrā as well as
a Vaiśyā, although the Śūdrā marriages were later disapproved
{%in toto.%} Instances of such intermarriage are common in the
Epic, and are viewed as normal in the Bṛhaddevatā.<sup>15</sup>
<div n="P"/>It was considered proper that the younger brothers and
sisters should not anticipate their elders by marrying before
them. The later Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas<sup>16</sup> present a series
of names expressive of such anticipation, censuring as sinful
those who bear them. These terms are the {%pari-vividāna,%}<sup>17</sup> or
perhaps {%agre-dadhus,%}<sup>18</sup> the man who, though a younger brother,
marries before his elder brother, the latter being then called the
{%parivitta;%}<sup>19</sup> the {%agre-didhiṣu,%}<sup>20</sup> the man who weds a younger
daughter while her elder sister is still unmarried; and the
{@Didhiṣū-pati,@}<sup>21</sup> who is the husband of the latter. The passages
do not explicitly say that the exact order of birth must always
be followed, but the mention of the terms shows that the order
was often broken.
<div n="P"/>{%Widow Remarriage.%} — The remarriage of a widow was
[Page1-477+ 62]
apparently permitted. This seems originally to have taken the
form of the marriage of the widow to the brother or other
nearest kinsman of the dead man in order to produce children.
At any rate, the ceremony is apparently alluded to in a funeral
hymn of the Rigveda;<sup>22</sup> for the alternative explanation, which
sees in the verse a reference to the ritual of the Puruṣamendha
(‘human sacrifice’), although accepted by Hillebrandt<sup>23</sup> and
Delbrück,<sup>24</sup> is not at all probable, while the ordinary view is
supported by the Sūtra evidence.<sup>25</sup> Moreover, another passage
of the Rigveda<sup>26</sup> clearly refers to the marriage of the widow
and the husband's brother ({%devṛ%}), which constitutes what the
Indians later knew as Niyoga.<sup>27</sup> This custom was probably
not followed except in cases where no son was already born.
This custom was hardly remarriage in the strict sense, since
the brother might — so far as appears — be already married
himself. In the Atharvaveda,<sup>28</sup> a verse refers to a charm which
would secure the reunion, in the next world, of a wife and her
second husband. Though, as Delbrück<sup>29</sup> thinks, this very
possibly refers to a case in which the first husband was still
alive,<sup>30</sup> but was impotent or had lost caste ({%patita%}),<sup>31</sup> still it is
certain that the later Dharma Sūtras<sup>32</sup> began to recognize
ordinary remarriage in case of the death of the first husband.
[Page1-478+ 67]
Pischel<sup>33</sup> finds some evidence in the Rigveda<sup>34</sup> to the effect
that a woman could remarry if her husband disappeared and
could not be found or heard of.
<div n="P"/>{%Polygamy.%} — A Vedic Indian could have more than one wife.
This is proved clearly by many passages in the Rigveda;<sup>35</sup>
Manu, according to the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā,<sup>36</sup> had ten wives;
and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>37</sup> explains polygamy by a
characteristic legend. Moreover, the king regularly has four
wives attributed to him, the Mahiṣī,<sup>38</sup> the Parivṛktī,<sup>39</sup> the
Vāvātā,<sup>40</sup> and the Pālāgalī.<sup>41</sup> The Mahiṣī appears to be the
chief wife, being the first one married according to the Śata-
patha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>42</sup> The Parivṛktī, ‘the neglected,’ is explained
by Weber<sup>43</sup> and Pischel<sup>44</sup> as one that has had no son. The
Vāvātā is ‘the favourite,’ while the Pālāgalī is, according to
Weber, the daughter of the last of the court officials. The
names are curious, and not very intelligible, but the evidence
points to the wife first wedded alone being a wife in the fullest
sense. This view is supported by the fact emphasized by
[Page1-479+ 63]
Delbrück,<sup>45</sup> that in the sacrifice the Patnī is usually mentioned
in the singular, apparent exceptions being due to some mytho-
logical reason.<sup>46</sup> Zimmer<sup>47</sup> is of opinion that polygamy is
dying out in the Rigvedic period, monogamy being developed
from polygamy; Weber,<sup>48</sup> however, thinks that polygamy is
secondary, a view that is supported by more recent anthro-
pology.<sup>49</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%Polyandry.%} — On the other hand, polyandry is not Vedic.<sup>50</sup>
There is no passage containing any clear reference to such
a custom. The most that can be said is that in the Rigveda<sup>51</sup>
and the Atharvaveda<sup>52</sup> verses are occasionally found in which
husbands are mentioned in relation to a single wife. It is
difficult to be certain of the correct explanation of each separate
instance of this mode of expression; but even if Weber's<sup>53</sup>
view, that the plural is here used {%majestatis causā,%} is not
accepted, Delbrück's<sup>54</sup> explanation by mythology is probably
right. In other passages<sup>55</sup> the plural is simply generic.
<div n="P"/>{%Marital Relations.%} — Despite polygamy, however, there is
ample evidence that the marriage tie was not, as Weber<sup>56</sup> has
suggested, lightly regarded as far as the fidelity of the wife
was concerned. There is, however, little trace of the husband's
being expected to be faithful as a matter of morality. Several
[Page1-480+ 57]
passages,<sup>57</sup> indeed, forbid, with reference to ritual abstinence,
intercourse with the {%strī%} of another. This may imply that
adultery on the husband's part was otherwise regarded as
venial. But as the word {%strī%} includes all the ‘womenfolk,’
daughters and slaves, as well as wife, the conclusion can hardly
be drawn that intercourse with another man's ‘wife’ was
normally regarded with indifference.<sup>58</sup> The curious ritual of
the Varuṇapraghāsās,<sup>59</sup> in which the wife of the sacrificer is
questioned as to her lovers, is shown by Delbrück<sup>60</sup> to be a
part of a rite meant to expiate unchastity on the part of a wife,
not as a normal question for a sacrificer to put to his own wife.
Again, Yājñavalkya's doctrine in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>61</sup>
which seems to assert that no one cares if a wife is unchaste
({%paraḥ-puṃsā%}) or not, really means that no one cares if the wife
is away from the men who are sacrificing, as the wives of
the gods are apart from them during the particular rite in
question. Monogamy is also evidently approved,<sup>62</sup> so that
some higher idea of morality was in course of formation. On
the other hand, no Vedic text gives us the rule well known to
other Indo-Germanic<sup>63</sup> peoples that the adulterer taken in the
act can be killed with impunity, though the later legal literature
has traces of this rule.<sup>64</sup> There is also abundant evidence that
the standard of ordinary sexual morality was not high.
<div n="P"/>{%Hetairai.%} — In the Rigveda<sup>65</sup> there are many references to
illegitimate love and to the abandonment of the offspring of
[Page1-481+ 59]
such unions,<sup>66</sup> especially in the case of a protégé of Indra,
often mentioned as the {%parāvṛkta%} or {%parāvṛj.%}<sup>67</sup> The ‘son of
a maiden’ ({%kumārī-putra%}) is already spoken of in the Vājasaneyi
Saṃhitā.<sup>68</sup> Such a person appears with a metronymic in the
Upaniṣad period:<sup>69</sup> this custom may be the origin of metro-
nymics such as those which make up a great part of the lists
of teachers (Vaṃśas) of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad.<sup>70</sup> The
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>71</sup> refers to illicit unions of Śūdra and Ārya,
both male and female, besides giving in its list of victims at
the Puruṣamedha, or ‘human sacrifice,’ several whose desig-
nations apparently mean ‘courtesan’ ({%atītvarī%})<sup>72</sup> and ‘procuress
of abortion’ ({%atiṣkadvarī%}),<sup>73</sup> while the ‘dyeing woman’ ({%rajayitrī%})
is dedicated to sensuality.<sup>74</sup> Pischel and Geldner also see
many references to Hetairai in other passages of the Rigveda,<sup>75</sup>
especially where mention is made of Uṣas, the goddess of
Dawn, who in their view is the characteristic Hetaira. At any
rate, there is little doubt that the ‘dancer’ ({%nṛtū%}) referred to in
one passage of the Rigveda<sup>76</sup> was a Hetaira. When women
are referred to as going to the {@Samana,@} or ‘place of meeting,’
Hetairai are probably also meant.<sup>77</sup> Grave cases of immorality
are alluded to in the Rigveda.<sup>78</sup> The love of father and
daughter, as shown in the myth of Prajāpati,<sup>79</sup> is evidently
censured, but the actual existence of this form of incest is
recognized in the Atharvaveda.<sup>80</sup> Girls who had lost their
[Page1-482+ 76]
natural protectors — father or brother<sup>81</sup> — were apt to be reduced
to live by immorality.
<div n="P"/>{%Forms of Marriage.%} — The state of society revealed in the
Vedic age seems to point to considerable freedom on the part
of both man and woman in selecting a wife or a husband.
At any rate, it is not clear that either the father or the mother
controlled the marriage of son or daughter of mature age,<sup>82</sup>
though no doubt the parents or parent often arranged a suit-
able match.<sup>83</sup> The marriage was frequently arranged through
an intermediary, the ‘wooer’ ({%vara%}),<sup>84</sup> presumably after those
concerned had in effect come to an agreement. The sale of
a daughter was not unknown,<sup>85</sup> but a certain amount of dis-
credit would seem to have attached to it,<sup>86</sup> and sons-in-law in
such cases were sometimes stingy. On the other hand, dowries
were not infrequently given, especially no doubt when damsels
Suffered from bodily defects.<sup>87</sup> Occasionally marriages by
[Page1-483+ 56]
capture may have taken place, but only as knightly feats, as
when {@Vimada@} carried off {@Purumitra's@} daughter against her
father's wish, but very possibly with her own consent.<sup>88</sup> The
later law-books and the Epic describe in much detail various
forms of marriage, but they all seem reducible to three types:
({%a%}) that which is based on mutual consent, the {%prājāpatya%}
(‘connected with Prajāpati’); ({%b%}) that in which a price is paid
for the bride, the {%āsura%} (‘Asura-like’), {%ārṣa%} (‘connected with
the Ṛṣis’), {%brāhma%} (‘relating to Brahman’), or {%daiva%} (‘divine’);
({%c%}) those which consist in stealing the bride, the {%kṣātra%}
(‘warrior-like’) or the {%rākṣasa%} (‘demon-like’) mode, of all of
which traces are found in Vedic literature.<sup>89</sup> For instance,
the gift of a maiden for services rendered or other object is
exemplified in the story of {@Cyavana@} in the Jaiminīya Brāh-
maṇa,<sup>90</sup> and in that of {@Śyāvāśva@} in the Bṛhaddevatā.<sup>91</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%Wedding Ceremony.%} — In normal marriages the bridal was
celebrated by an elaborate ceremony which bears in essentials
and details the strongest resemblance to the form observed by
other Indo-Germanic as well as non-Indo-Germanic peoples,<sup>92</sup>
and which was destined to secure the stability and fruitfulness
of the union. The ceremony commenced at the bride's house,<sup>93</sup>
to which the bridegroom with his friends and relations repaired,
and in which he met the friends and relations of the bride.<sup>94</sup>
A cow or cows were slain for the entertainment of the guests.<sup>95</sup>
The bridegroom having caused the bride to mount a stone,
formally grasped her hand, and led her round the household
[Page1-484+ 64]
fire.<sup>96</sup> This act constituted the marriage, the husband hence
being called ‘he who takes by the hand’ ({%hasta-grābha%}).<sup>97</sup> The
festivities being over,<sup>98</sup> the bridegroom took the bride to his
home on a car in a marriage procession,<sup>99</sup> all to the accom-
paniment of suitable stanzas. Then followed cohabitation.<sup>100</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%Wife's Property and Status.%} — We have very little information
as to the legal relations of wife and husband after marriage.
It may be assumed that the husband appropriated the wife's
dowry, if any, as well as her earnings, if any: even in the
Epic<sup>101</sup> the rise of the recognition of women's property as
their own ({%strī-dhana%}) is only slow. That the husband was
absolute master of a wife as of a slave is not probable, though
he doubtless exercised the same power of correction as was
expressly allowed in the eighteenth century by English law.
The poetical ideal<sup>102</sup> of the family was decidedly high, and we
have no reason to doubt that it was often actually fulfilled.
Moreover, the wife on her marriage was at once given an
honoured position in the house; she is emphatically mistress
in her husband's home, exercising authority over her father-
in-law, her husband's brothers, and her unmarried sisters.<sup>103</sup>
No doubt the case contemplated is one in which the eldest son
[Page1-485+ 59]
of a family has become its head owing to the decrepitude<sup>104</sup> of
the parents, his wife then taking the place of the mistress
of the joint family while the brothers and sisters are still
unmarried. It is not inconsistent with the great stress else-
where<sup>105</sup> laid on the respect due to a father-in-law, who then
is probably regarded as still in full possession of his faculties,
and controls the house while his son continues to live with
him. The respect would no doubt equally apply if the son
had set up a separate family of his own.<sup>106</sup>
<div n="P"/>Moreover, the wife was a regular participator in the offerings
of the husband. In this connexion the term {@Patnī@} regularly
applies to her in the Brāhmaṇas,<sup>107</sup> where {@Jāyā@} designates her
in her conjugal capacity, not in that of sharer in the sacrifice.
In this respect her position gradually deteriorated: thus the
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>108</sup> describes a certain ceremony in which
the wife ({%jāyā%}) alone offered the oblation in former times, while
later a priest might do so instead. The same Brāhmaṇa
shows other traces of a lowering in the position of women,
probably due to the growing sense of the importance of cere-
monial priority.<sup>109</sup> So in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā<sup>110</sup> women
generally are classed with dice and drink as three chief evils,
and woman is declared to be ‘untruth,’<sup>111</sup> and connected with
Nirṛti, ‘calamity.’<sup>112</sup> A woman too, according to the Taittirīya
Saṃhitā,<sup>113</sup> is inferior even to a bad man, and a sarcastic
reference is made in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>114</sup> to her power of
[Page1-486+ 58]
getting things from her husband by cajolery at night. On the
other hand must be set the encomia on woman: a woman is
half her husband,<sup>115</sup> and completes him;<sup>116</sup> and in the Rigveda<sup>117</sup>
attacks on women mingle with the general assumption of their
good qualities. None the less, the Brāhmaṇas clearly indicate
a gradual decline in their position, which is evident from the
rule that requires the wife to eat after her husband.<sup>118</sup> Scolds
were also known: the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>119</sup> praises the wife
‘who does not answer back’ ({%aprativādinī%}). Women bore no
part in political life: men go to the assembly, not women, the
Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā<sup>120</sup> expressly says. On the other hand,
with the advance of education, women shared in the intel-
lectual interests of the day, as is exemplified by Yājñavalkya's<sup>121</sup>
two wives, of whom one was interested in his philosophical
discussions, the other not. Other women are also referred to
in the Upaniṣads as teachers, but whether they were married
is not certain.<sup>122</sup>
<div n="P"/>But the main object of a woman's marriage was the pro-
duction of children, this being repeatedly asserted in the
Rigveda and later.<sup>123</sup> The desire for offspring, as was natural
in a society which mainly counted relationship through the
father, took the form of a wish for a son to perform the
necessary funeral rites for the father, and to continue his line.
It was no doubt possible to adopt a son, but in the Rigveda<sup>124</sup>
this custom is plainly viewed as unsatisfactory. The practice
[Page1-487+ 67]
is recognized,<sup>125</sup> as we have seen above of Niyoga, in the
appointment of a brother to beget children with the wife of
a dead man, or perhaps of a man who is childless. ‘Sonless-
ness’ ({%avīratā%}) is placed on the same level as lack of property
({%amati%}), and Agni is besought to protect from it.<sup>126</sup> The birth
of a daughter was certainly not specially welcome: the Athar-
vaveda<sup>127</sup> in one hymn distinctly invokes the birth of a son,
and deprecates that of a daughter, while the Aitareya Brāh-
maṇa<sup>128</sup> contains an old verse which says that a daughter is
a misery ({%kṛpaṇam%}), while a son is a light in the highest heaven
({%jyotir ha putraḥ parame vyoman%}). But there is no proof that
the Vedic Indians practised the exposure of female children.
This conclusion, deduced from certain passages in the later
Saṃhitās<sup>129</sup> by Zimmer<sup>130</sup> and Delbrück,<sup>131</sup> has been disproved
by Böhtlingk.
<div n="P"/>{%Child Life.%} — No doubt the care of a child was left to
the mother, but we learn little from the earlier litera-
ture<sup>132</sup> of the life of the young. The length of the period
of pregnancy is frequently placed at ten (doubtless lunar)
months.<sup>133</sup> On birth the child was first fed with milk or ghee,
and then given the breast.<sup>134</sup> On the eighth day after birth
[Page1-488+ 78]
the infant was washed.<sup>135</sup> The cutting of the teeth was also
a solemn occasion,<sup>136</sup> and is the subject of a hymn in the
Atharvaveda. Reference is also made to children's learning
to speak, which the Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>137</sup> ascribes to the end
of the first year of life. The Aitareya Āraṇyaka<sup>138</sup> asserts that
the words {@Tata@} and {@Tāta,@} onomatopoetic words like ‘dada,’<sup>139</sup>
are the first words of a child's speech, giving therein perhaps
an unfair prominence to the father. The Atharvaveda<sup>140</sup>
further contains at least one hymn for the ceremony of the
first shaving of the young man's beard. The giving of a name
was also an occasion of importance, a second one being often
added.<sup>141</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%Satī.%} — On the death of her husband, in some cases the
widow burned herself or was burned by his relations.<sup>142</sup> This
is clearly implied in the reference to this ancient custom in
the Atharvaveda.<sup>143</sup> On the other hand, the Rigveda does not
contemplate the custom anywhere, but on the contrary con-
siders the widow as married apparently to the brother of the
dead man.<sup>144</sup> The custom of Suttee would therefore appear
during the Vedic age to have been in abeyance, at least as
a general rule. At all times the practice seems to have been
mainly usual among families of the warrior class, to judge
from the other Indo-Germanic parallels.<sup>145</sup> In other classes
[Page1-489+ 31]
the survival of wives was more necessary, and the remarriage of
widows, whether prohibited or allowed in the texts, is proof
that there were widows who could be remarried.<sup>146</sup>
<F>1) {%Cf.%} Rv. i. 117, 7; ii. 17, 7; x. 39,
3; 40, 5. {@Ghoṣā@} is the chief example
of this condition. The Atharvaveda
(i. 14) also refers to such a case (see
Bloomfield, {%Hymns of the Atharvaveda,%}
253). The ornaments of maidens, espe-
cially at seasons of festival, are referred

the love of the youth for the maiden,
and his seeking her — {%e.g.,%} Rv. i. 115, 2;
Av. ii. 30; iii. 25; vi. 8; 9; 82; to
their mutual affection — {%e.g.,%} Rv. i. 167,
3; ix. 32, 5; 56, 3; x. 34, 5; and to
jealousy and love philtres for the pur-
pose of recalling wandering affections
-{%e.g.,%} Av. vi. 18; 42; 43; 94; 139;
vii. 45. The gifts of the lover are
referred to in Rv. i. 117, 18. Some of

<F>86) Rv. i. 109, 2, refers to the gods
Indra and Agni as more generous than
a {%vijāmātṛ,%} ‘son-in-law,’ or a {%syāla,%}
‘brother-in-law.’ The force of {%vi%} in
the former word must be unfavourable,
and the sense, as indicated by Pischel,
is no doubt, that a son-in-law who was
not in other respects altogether suitable
might have to buy his bride at a heavy
cost. The {%vijāmātṛ%} is, in fact, the
{%aśrīro jāmātā,%} the ‘ignoble son-in-law,’
of Rv. viii. 2, 20. {%Cf.%} Yāska, Nirukta,

{@Paruṣṇī@}¦ is the name of a river which is mentioned in the
Nadī-stuti (‘Praise of Rivers’),<sup>1</sup> and in the song of Sudās’
victory over the ten kings,<sup>2</sup> which seems to have been made
decisive by the rise of the river drowning the fugitives.<sup>3</sup> In
these passages and one of the eighth book of the Rigveda,<sup>4</sup>
where it is called a ‘great stream’ ({%mahenadi%}), the name is
certainly that of the river later called Ravi (Irāvatī), as recog-
nized by Yāska.<sup>5</sup> Pischel<sup>6</sup> sees a reference to it in two other
passages of the Rigveda,<sup>7</sup> where ‘wool’ ({%ūṛṇā%}) is connected
with the word {%paruṣṇī,%} and the allusion to the river is accepted
by Max Müller<sup>8</sup> and Oldenberg,<sup>9</sup> though they are not fully
agreed as to the exact sense of the passages in question.
Pischel suggests that the name is derived from the ‘flocks’
({%parus%}) of wool, not from the bends of the river, as understood
by the Nirukta,<sup>5</sup> or from its reeds, as Roth<sup>10</sup> suggests.
[Page1-500+ 47]
<div n="P"/>The mention of the Paruṣṇī and the Yamunā in the hymn
celebrating the victory of Sudās has given rise to the conjectures
of Hopkins,<sup>11</sup> that the Yamunā in that hymn is merely another
name for the Paruṣṇī, and of Geldner,<sup>12</sup> that the Paruṣṇī there
is merely a tributary of the Yamunā (Jumna). But neither
interpretation is either essential or even probable. The hymn
is a condensed one, and may well be taken as celebrating two
great victories of Sudās. There is a doubtful reference to the
Paruṣṇī in the Atharvaveda.<sup>13</sup>
<F>1) x. 75, 5.</F>
<F>2) vii. 18, 8. 9.</F>
<F>3) It is impossible to decide precisely
what part the river played in the battle.
It is usually held that the enemies of
Sudās tried to divert the stream, but
failed, and were drowned in its current.
So Zimmer, {%Altindisches Leben,%} 11;
Macdonell, {%Sanskrit Literature,%} 154;
Geldner, {%Rigveda, Kommentar,%} 103, holds
that Sudās was caught between two
opposing armies, and had to escape
over the Paruṣṇī, that his enemies
tried to divert it to render him more
accessible to their attack, but failed,
and were overwhelmed in the river.
Hopkins, {%India, Old and New,%} 52 {%et seq.,%}
may be right in rejecting {%in toto%} the
theory of the attempted diversion of
the waters, though in the {%Journal of the%}

that he is identical with {@Tirindira,@} but the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta
Sūtra<sup>2</sup> mentions Tirindira Pāraśavya as the patron of {@Vatsa@}
{@Kāṇva.@} In another passage occurring in the Vṛṣākapi hymn,<sup>3</sup>
Parśu Mānavī occurs, apparently as a woman, daughter of
Manu, but who is meant it is quite impossible to say. Excepting
these two, there are no other occurrences in which the word has
with any probability the value of a proper name in the Rigveda.
<div n="P"/>Ludwig,<sup>4</sup> however, sees in several other places an allusion to
the Parśus. Thus in one passage of the Rigveda<sup>5</sup> he finds a
reference to the defeat of {@Kuruśravaṇa@} by the Parśus; in
another<sup>6</sup> he finds a reference to the Pṛthus and Parśus — {%i.e.,%} the
Parthians and the Persians. He also sees the Parthians in
{@Pārthava,@} a name found in one hymn.<sup>7</sup> The same view is
taken by Weber,<sup>8</sup> who holds that historical connexions with the
[Page1-505+ 38]
Persians are referred to. But Zimmer<sup>9</sup> points out that this
conclusion is not justified; the Parśus were known to Pāṇini<sup>10</sup>
as a warrior tribe; the Pāraśavas were a tribe in south-west
{@Madhyadeśa;@} and the {%Periplus%}<sup>11</sup> knows a tribe of Parthoi in
north India. At most the only conclusion to be drawn is that
the Indians and Iranians were early connected, as was of
course the case. Actual historical contact cannot be asserted
with any degree of probability.

fastening it on firmly, and the epithet {%su-pavi,%} ‘having a good
tire,’ is found in the Atharvaveda<sup>4</sup> with {%su-nābhi,%} ‘having a good
nave,’ and {%su-cakra,%} ‘having a good wheel.’ The tires were, of
course, of metal,<sup>5</sup> and being sharp,<sup>6</sup> could serve on occasion as
weapons.<sup>7</sup> The St. Petersburg Dictionary in one passage of
[Page1-508+ 54]
the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>8</sup> takes Pavi to mean a metal rim on the
stone for pounding Soma, but this seems improbable, because
no such metal attachment is elsewhere alluded to. Hille-
brandt<sup>9</sup> seems clearly right in accepting the sense of ‘sharp
edge’ in this passage, especially as the stones in the Rigveda<sup>10</sup>
are, in allusion to their rolling action, styled ‘rims without
horses and without chariots’ ({%anaśvāsaḥ pavayo 'rathāḥ%}).
<div n="P"/>The Nirukta<sup>11</sup> ascribes to Pavi the sense of arrow ({%śalya%}), but
this is very uncertain. The St. Petersburg Dictionary cites for
this use two passages of the Rigveda,<sup>12</sup> but in one the secondary
sense of sharp-edged weapon with reference to the bolt of Indra
is quite likely, and in the other, where the expression {%vāṇasya%}
{%pavi%} occurs, the sharp-edged pounding-stone of the ‘reed,’<sup>13</sup>
meaning the stalk of the Soma plant, may be meant. Hille-
brandt<sup>14</sup> thinks a reference to the shape of the Soma plant is
intended. Pavī-nasa, the name of a demon mentioned in the
Atharvaveda,<sup>15</sup> seems to throw no light on this point, for while
the St. Petersburg Dictionary takes it to mean ‘whose nose is
like a spearhead,’ it is translated as ‘rim-nosed’ (presumably in
allusion to the curved shape of the nose) by Whitney.<sup>16</sup>

{@Paśu@}¦ means ‘animal’ generally, including man. There is
frequent mention<sup>1</sup> of the five sacrificial animals — the horse, the
cow, the sheep, the goat, and man. Seven such domestic
animals are spoken of in the Atharvaveda<sup>2</sup> and later;<sup>3</sup> probably,
as Whitney<sup>4</sup> observes, merely as a sacred mystic number, not,
as the commentator<sup>5</sup> explains, the usual five with the ass and
the camel added. Animals are also referred to as {%ubhayadant%}
[Page1-510+ 63]
and {%anyatodant.%} They are further<sup>6</sup> classified as those which
take hold with the hand ({%hastādānāḥ%}), man ({%puruṣa%}), elephant
({%hastin%}), and ape ({%markaṭa%}), and those which grasp by the mouth
({%mukhādānāḥ%}). Another division is that of biped ({%dvipād%}) and
quadruped ({%catuṣpād%}).<sup>7</sup> Man is a biped;<sup>8</sup> he is the first ({%pra-%}
{%thama%}) of the beasts;<sup>9</sup> he alone of animals lives a hundred
years ({%śatāyus%}),<sup>10</sup> and he is king of the animals.<sup>11</sup> He possesses
speech ({%vāc%}) in conjunction with the other animals.<sup>12</sup> In the
Aitareya Āraṇyaka<sup>13</sup> an elaborate distinction is drawn between
vegetables, animals, and man in point of intellect.
<div n="P"/>Of animals apart from man a threefold division is offered in
the Rigveda<sup>14</sup> — into those of the air ({%vāyavya%}), those of the
jungle ({%āraṇya%}), and those of the village ({%grāmya%}), or tame
animals. The division into {%āraṇya%} and {%grāmya%} animals is quite
common.<sup>15</sup> In the Yajurveda Saṃhitās<sup>16</sup> is found a division
into {%eka-śapha,%} ‘whole-hoofed’; {%kṣudra,%} ‘small’; and {%āraṇya,%}
‘wild,’ the two former classes denoting the tame animals.<sup>16</sup>
The horse and the ass are {%eka-śapha;%}<sup>17</sup> the {%kṣudra%} are the sheep,
the goat, and the ox: this distinction being parallel to that of
{%ubhayadant%} and {%anyatodant.%}<sup>18</sup> Zimmer<sup>19</sup> sees in a passage of the
Atharvaveda<sup>20</sup> a division of wild animals ({%āraṇya%}) into five
classes: (1) those of the jungle described as the ‘dread beasts
[Page1-511+ 43]
which are in the wood’ ({%mṛgā bhīmā vane hitāḥ%}); (2) winged
creatures, represented by the {@Haṃsa,@} ‘gander,’ {@Suparṇa,@}
‘eagle,’ {@Śakuna,@} ‘bird’; (3) amphibia — {@Śiṃśumāra,@} ‘alligator,’
and {@Ajagara,@} ‘crocodile’ (?); (4) ‘fish,’ {@Purīkaya, Jaṣa,@}
and {@Matsya;@} (5) insects and worms (described as {%rajasāḥ%}).
But this division is more ingenious than probable, and it is
ignored by both Bloomfield<sup>21</sup> and Whitney.<sup>22</sup>

{@Pastyā@}¦ (fem. pl.) is a word occurring in several passages of
the Rigveda.<sup>1</sup> Roth<sup>2</sup> ascribes to it the meaning of ‘house’ or
‘dwelling,’ in the wide sense of the term, as well as that of the
‘family’ living in the house; and this view is accepted by
Zimmer.<sup>3</sup> On the other hand, Pischel<sup>4</sup> finds in two of the
passages<sup>5</sup> usually referred to Pastyā the neuter Pastya, which
appears in {@Pastya-sad@} and in {@Pastyā-vant@} (where the length
of the second syllable is not primitive), and which is certainly
found in the Rigveda<sup>6</sup> in the metaphorical sense of ‘dwelling,’
ascribed to it in the Naighaṇṭuka.<sup>7</sup> In the other passages<sup>8</sup> he
thinks the word means ‘rivers’ or ‘waters’; in particular,
where Soma in the middle of the Pastyās<sup>9</sup> is spoken of, the
sees a reference to {@Kurukṣetra,@} with its several rivers,<sup>10</sup> {@Āpayā,@}
{@Dṛṣadvatī,@} and {@Sarasvatī@} ({%cf.%} 2. {@Pastyāvant@}). In some passages<sup>11</sup>
he sees in Pastyā the proper name of a stream, just as Sindhu
primarily means ‘river,’ then the ‘Indus.’

that river ({%cf.%} {@Turaśravas@}). Hillebrandt<sup>4</sup> sees in all the

of Gedrosia, or the <lang n="greek">Παροῦται</lang>, who were found in <lang n="greek">Αρεία</lang><sup>7</sup> He
suggests that they were originally ‘mountaineers’ ({%Cf.%} {@Parvata@}).
Ludwig<sup>8</sup> holds a similar view, and Geldner<sup>9</sup> recognizes a people
as meant. The mention of the {@Sarasvatī@} in connexion with
the Pārāvatas<sup>2</sup> in the Rigveda accords generally with their
position on the Yamunā in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.<sup>3</sup>

or be living with his eldest son, after he ceased to be able to
control the family.

{@Pitṛ,@}¦ common from the Rigveda onwards, denotes ‘father,’
not so much as the ‘begetter’ ({%janitṛ%}),<sup>1</sup> but rather as the pro-
tector of the child, this being probably also the etymological
sense of the word.<sup>2</sup> The father in the Rigveda<sup>3</sup> stands for all
that is good and kind. Hence Agni is compared with a father,<sup>4</sup>
while Indra is even dearer than a father.<sup>5</sup> The father carries
his son in his arms,<sup>6</sup> and places him on his lap,<sup>7</sup> while the child
pulls his garment to attract attention.<sup>8</sup> In later years the son
depends on his father for help in trouble,<sup>9</sup> and greets him
with joy.<sup>10</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is difficult to ascertain precisely how far the son was
subject to parental control, and how long such control con-
tinued. Reference is made in the Rigveda<sup>11</sup> to a father's
chastising his son for gambling, and {@Ṛjrāśva@} is said to have
been blinded by his father.<sup>12</sup> From the latter statement
Zimmer<sup>13</sup> infers the existence of a developed {%patria potestas,%} but
to lay stress on this isolated and semi-mythical incident would
be unwise. It is, however, quite likely that the {%patria potestas%}
was originally strong, for we have other support for the thesis
in the Roman {%patria potestas.%} If there is no proof that a father
[Page1-527+ 59]
legally controlled his son's wedding,<sup>14</sup> and not much that he
controlled his daughter's,<sup>15</sup> the fact is in itself not im-
probable.
<div n="P"/>There is again no evidence to show whether a son, when
grown up, normally continued to stay with his father, his wife
becoming a member of the father's household, or whether he
set up a house of his own: probably the custom varied. Nor
do we know whether the son was granted a special plot of land
on marriage or otherwise, or whether he only came into such
property after his father's death. But any excessive estimate
of the father's powers over a son who was no longer a minor
and naturally under his control, must be qualified by the fact
that in his old age the sons might divide their father's property,<sup>16</sup>
or he might divide it amongst them,<sup>17</sup> and that when the
father-in-law became aged he fell under the control of his son's
wife.<sup>18</sup> There are also obscure traces that in old age a father
might be exposed, though there is no reason to suppose that
this was usual in Vedic India.<sup>19</sup>
<div n="P"/>Normally the son was bound to give his father full obedience.<sup>20</sup>
The later Sūtras show in detail the acts of courtesy which he
owed his father, and they allow him to eat the remnants of his
father's food.<sup>21</sup> On the other hand, the father was expected
to be kind. The story of {@Śunaḥśepa@} in the Aitareya Brāh-
[Page1-528+ 58]
maṇa<sup>22</sup> emphasizes the horror with which the father's heartless
treatment of his son was viewed. The Upaniṣads<sup>23</sup> insist on the
spiritual succession from father to son. The kissing of a son<sup>24</sup>
was a frequent and usual token of affection, even in mature
years.
<div n="P"/>On the failure of natural children, adoption was possible.<sup>25</sup>
It was even resorted to when natural children existed, but
when it was desired to secure the presence in the family of a
person of specially high qualifications, as in Viśvāmitra's
adoption of Śunaḥśepa.<sup>26</sup> It is not clear that adoption from
one caste into another was possible, for there is no good
evidence that Viśvāmitra was, as Weber<sup>27</sup> holds, a Kṣatriya
who adopted a Brāhmaṇa. Adoption was also not always in
high favour: it may be accidental or not that a hymn of the
Vasiṣṭha book of the Rigveda<sup>28</sup> condemns the usage. It was
also possible for the father who had a daughter, but no sons,
to appoint her to bear a son for him. At any rate the practice
appears to be referred to in an obscure verse of the Rigveda<sup>29</sup>
as interpreted by Yāska.<sup>30</sup> Moreover, it is possible that the
difficulty of a brotherless maiden finding a husband<sup>31</sup> may have
been due in part to the possibility of her father desiring to
make her a Putrikā, the later technical name for a daughter
whose son is to belong to her father's family.
<div n="P"/>There can be no doubt that in a family the father took
precedence of the mother.<sup>32</sup> Delbrück<sup>33</sup> explains away the
apparent cases to the contrary.<sup>34</sup> There is no trace of the
[Page1-529+ 74]
family as a land-owning corporation.<sup>35</sup> The dual form Pitarau
regularly means ‘father and mother,’ ‘parents.’<sup>36</sup>

<F>35) Baden Powell, whose various
works ({%Indian Village Community,%} 1896;
{%Village Communities in India,%} 1899, etc.)
have done most to combat the view of
the village community in India as a
land-holding institution, is prepared to
recognize the family as a land-owning
unit, considering that the {%patria potestas%}
is a later growth, and not Indian (see,
{%e.g., Village Communities in India,%} 128
{%et seq.%}). Hopkins, {%India, Old and New,%}
218 {%et seq.,%} adopts a theory which allows
of individual and joint family owner-
ship side by side, the latter being
apparently the earlier but the decadent
stage. He expressly considers (p. 222)
that the son had an indefeasible right to
prevent the father from alienating the
hereditary land, which could only be
parted with by the consent of the village
if it were a case of joint ownership
({%cf.%} the verse cited by Jolly, {%Recht und%}
{%Sitte,%} 94). But it must be remembered
that, as is very clearly shown in the
case of English law by Pollock and
Maitland ({%History of English Law,%} 2,
337-352), the recognition of the rights
of sons may well be, not a sign of
original joint or family ownership, but
a development from the existence of
intestate succession, and as in England,
so in India, there is no trace of a
corporate joint family in the early
books. And, as Jolly ({%op. cit.,%} 76, 80)
shows, there are clear traces, both in
old and modern times, of a despotic
control of the family by the father even
after his sons grew up, provided only
that he was physically able to control
them. The same state of affairs seems
proved for early English law, as it is
beyond question for Roman law (see
Smith's {%Dictionary of Antiquities,%} 2, 351
{%et seq.%}). In Greece also, which is some-
times contrasted with Rome, there is
the clearest trace of both a real {%patria%}
{%potestas,%} and of the absolute ownership
of the land by the father as against
the son, especially in the archaic laws
of Gortyn (see Gardner and Jevons,
{%Greek Antiquities,%} 404, 405, 563, 566).</F>

{@Pitṛ-yāṇa,@}¦ the ‘way of the fathers,’ mentioned in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup>

Tilak<sup>3</sup> considers that the Devayāna corresponds with the
Uttarāyaṇa, ‘northern journey’ of the sun, and the Pitṛyāṇa
with the Dakṣiṇāyana, its ‘southern journey.’ He concludes
from a passage of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>4</sup> where three of
the seasons — spring, summer, and the rains — are ascribed to
the gods, but the others to the Pitṛs, or Fathers, that the
Devayāna began with the vernal equinox, and the Pitṛyāṇa
with the autumnal equinox. With this he connects the curious
[Page1-530+ 37]
distinction of Deva- and Yama-Nakṣatras in the Taittirīya
Brāhmaṇa.<sup>5</sup> These conclusions are, however, very improbable.

were, as suggested by Grierson,<sup>6</sup> really human foes, like the
north-western tribes, who even in later times were reputed
eaters of raw flesh (not necessarily as cannibals, but rather as
eaters of human flesh in ritual). This is, however, not at all
likely, the Piśācas having in all probability only meant ‘ghouls’
originally: when they appear as human tribes, they were
presumably thus designated in scorn. A science called Piśāca-
veda<sup>7</sup> or Piśāca-vidyā<sup>8</sup> is known in the later Vedic period.

<L>1860<pc>1-538<k1>pur<k2>pur
{@Pur@}¦ is a word of frequent occurrence in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and
later,<sup>2</sup> meaning ‘rampart,’ ‘fort,’ or ‘stronghold.’ Such fortifi-
cations must have been occasionally of considerable size, as
one is called ‘broad’ ({%pṛthvī%}) and ‘wide’ ({%urvī%}).<sup>3</sup> Elsewhere<sup>4</sup>
a fort ‘made of stone’ ({%aśmamayī%}) is mentioned. Sometimes
strongholds ‘of iron’ ({%āyasī%}) are referred to,<sup>5</sup> but these are
probably only metaphorical. A fort ‘full of kine’ ({%gomatī%}) is
mentioned,<sup>6</sup> showing that strongholds were used to hold cattle.
‘Autumnal’ ({%śāradī%}) forts are named, apparently as belonging
to the {@Dāsas:@} this may refer to the forts in that season being
[Page1-539+ 89]
occupied against Āryan attacks or against inundations caused
by overflowing rivers. Forts ‘with a hundred walls’ ({%śata-%}
{%bhuji%}) are spoken of.<sup>7</sup>
<div n="P"/>It would probably be a mistake to regard these forts as
permanently occupied fortified places like the fortresses of the
mediæval barony. They were probably merely places of refuge
against attack, ramparts of hardened earth with palisades and
a ditch ({%cf.%} {@Dehī@}). Pischel and Geldner,<sup>8</sup> however, think that
there were towns with wooden walls and ditches (<lang n="greek">περίβολος</lang> and
<lang n="greek">τάφρος</lang>) like the Indian town of Pāṭaliputra known to Megas-
thenes<sup>9</sup> and the Pāli texts.<sup>10</sup> This is possible, but hardly
susceptible of proof, and it is not without significance that the
word {@Nagara@} is of late occurrence. On the whole it is hardly
likely that in early Vedic times city life was much developed.
In the Epic, according to Hopkins,<sup>11</sup> there are found the
Nagara, ‘city’; {@Grāma,@} ‘village’; and Ghoṣa, ‘ranch.’ Vedic
literature hardly seems to go beyond the village, no doubt with
modifications in its later period.

{%Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen%}

<div n="P"/>{%Cf.%} Zimmer, {%Altindisches Leben,%} 142-
148, who compares the fact that neither
the Germans (Tacitus, {%Germania,%} 16)
nor the Slavs (Procopius, {%De bello Gotico,%}
iii. 14) lived in towns, but, like the
ancient Indians, were scattered in
villages, each consisting of the houses
and steadings of the several families
living in the village. The evidence
seems pretty convincing. It is true
that the Greeks, when we first find
them, evidently knew castles and for-
tresses of the mediæval type; but the
Greeks were clearly an invading race,
superimposed on an older and in
civilization more advanced people (see,
{%e.g.,%} Burrows, {%Discoveries in Crete%}). But
the Pur may, as Zimmer allows, have
sometimes been built within the limits
of the village. Whether, as he urges
(144), the {%śāradī pur%} was a protection
against the floods of autumn is un-
certain. {%Cf.%} Rv. i. 131, 4; 174, 2;
vi. 20, 10. In particular, it is not
legitimate to connect the mention of
those forts with the fact that the Pūrus
lived on either side of the Sindhu
(Indus), and to assume that Purukutsa's
attack on the aborigines was directed
against the forts in which they normally
protected themselves on the rising of
the river. No argument for the large
size of cities can be drawn from the
mention in the Kāṭhaka Upaniṣad, v. 1,
of {%ekādaśa-dvāra%} as an epithet of Pura
({%cf.%} Śvetāśvatara Upaniśad, iii. 18;
{%nava-dvāra pura,%} ‘the citadel of nine
doors’), because it is used meta-
phorically of the body, and the number
of doors depends on the nature of the
body (Keith, {%Aitareya Āraṇyaka,%} 185).
The evidence of the Śatapatha Brāh-
maṇa, xi. 1, 1, 2, 3, seems rather to
point to only one gate in a city.

{@Puru-kutsa@}¦ is the name of a king who is mentioned several
times in the Rigveda. In one passage<sup>1</sup> he is mentioned as a
contemporary of {@Sudās,@} but whether as a foe, according to
Ludwig,<sup>2</sup> or merely as a contemporary, according to Hille-
brandt,<sup>3</sup> is uncertain. In two other passages<sup>4</sup> he is mentioned
as victorious by divine favour, and in another<sup>5</sup> he appears as a
king of the {@Pūrus@} and a conqueror of the {@Dāsas.@} His son was
{@Trasadasyu,@}<sup>6</sup> who is accordingly called {@Paurukutsya@}<sup>7</sup> or
{@Paurukutsi.@}<sup>8</sup> Different conclusions have been drawn from one
hymn of the Rigveda<sup>9</sup> in which the birth of Purukutsa's son,
[Page1-542+ 44]
Trasadasyu, is mentioned. The usual interpretation is that
Purukutsa was killed in battle or captured, whereupon his
wife secured a son to restore the fortunes of the Pūrus. But
Sieg<sup>10</sup> offers a completely different interpretation. According
to him the word {@daurgahe,@} which occurs in the hymn, and
which in the ordinary view is rendered ‘descendant of Durgaha,’
an ancestor of Purukutsa, is the name of a horse, the hymn
recording the success of an Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’)
undertaken by Purukutsa for his wife, as by kings in later
times, to secure a son. This interpretation is supported by the
version of {%daurgahe%} given in the Śatapatha,<sup>11</sup> but is by no
means certain. Moreover, if Purukutsa was a contemporary of
Sudās, the defeat of the Pūrus by Sudās in the {@Dāśarājña@}<sup>12</sup>
might well have been the cause of the troubles from which
{@Purukutsānī,@} by the birth of Trasadasyu, rescued the family.
In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>13</sup> Purukutsa is called an Aikṣvāka.

<H>{@FOREWORD@}
<P>Messrs Motilal Banarsidas are to be congratulated on
bringing out this edition of Macdonald and Keith's Vedic Index
of names and subjects. This is a very useful compilation and
every student of Vedic literature finds it invaluable. It is much
more than what its name implies. There are illuminating notes
on a variety of subjects, Civil Law for instance, which supply
the background without which an exegesis of Vedic texts, inclu-
ding in the term the compendia of religion, ritual, tradition and
philosophy known as Brahamanas would not be possible. It is
not necessary to accept all the theses which the learned authors
have laid down for themselves. For instance, they are not
prepared to believe that Vedic literature is much earlier than
1200 B.C. for reasons which are not very difficult to understand.
Western scholars find it difficult to accord Indian culture and
civilization an antiquity as great as that of the Egyptians. They
are not prepared to admit, as Macdonald specifically states in
his preface, that the cult of Vedic gods like Indra, Varuna and
the Nasatyas could have travelled from India to Middle Asia.
For them the researches of Tilak and other Indian scholars who
find internal evidence in Vedic literature itself to carry Vedic
chronology back by several centuries and of an Aryan culture,
though not necessarily an Aryan race, rooted firmly in Indian
soil and sending out its off shoots to countries further west, have
no meaning. Normally, perhaps, such differences in matters
apparently of purely an academic interest should not affect
the value of a book like the present Index. But, it can easily be
seen that at times the interpretation of particular terms would
be affected by such considerations. To take the word ‘Sindhu’
by way of example, a person who is wedded to the theory of
the Central Asian origin of Aryan culture cannot but translate
the word as river. Obviously, there are no oceans in Central
Asia. On the other hand, a scholar who is convinced that the
original home of the Aryans as we know them in the Rig Veda
[Page1-ii+ 18]
was in the Sapta Sindhav region and who, at the same time,
take cognisance of recent researches in the geology of ancient
India, will probably be forced to the conclusion that several
passages can convey no sensible meaning unless Sindhu is taken
to stand for sea.
<P>Quite obviously, the occasions where such sharp differences
of interpretation can arise will not be many and Macdonald
and Keith's work is still, so far as I am aware, the only standard
work of reference on the subject with which it deals. It is a
happy sign of the times that there is growing interest in the
country in Sanskrit and Sanskrit literature which is a key to
our knowledge of the origin of Indian culture, and I am sure
the present edition will bring the book within easy reach of a
large number of Indian readers who cannot easily find access
to it otherwise.

<H>PREFACE
<P>{@Inception and Progress of the Book.@} — The origination of the
present work was due to Professor T. W. Rhys Davids at the
time when, several years ago, he was appointed general editor
of the Indian Text Series to be published under the auspices
of the Secretary of State for India. He then asked me to
contribute a work supplying the historical material, as repre-
sented by proper names, to be found in the earliest period of
Indian literature antecedent to the rise of Buddhism towards
the close of the sixth century B.C. Since the subject came
within the range of my special studies and moreover appeared
to be one of considerable importance, I agreed to the proposal.
But I did so with hesitation, because my leisure for a long time
to come was already mortgaged by two works which involved
much labour and on which I was already engaged. I soon
came to the conclusion that till those works — the {%Bṛhaddevatā%}
and the {%Vedic Grammar%} — were out of my hands, I could spare
no time for the third book, the mere preparation, to say nothing
of the publication, of which would thus have to be postponed
for several years. Another hindrance would be caused by the
tour of study and research in India which I contemplated making
at the earliest opportunity. With the prospect of these long
delays before me, I was tempted to throw up a task that seemed
to have been rashly undertaken. At the same time, I was re-
luctant either to abandon or to put off indefinitely what I had
once begun. It also seemed a pity to relinquish an enterprise
which, if properly carried out, promised to be very useful.
[Page1-vi+ 34]
<NI>Under these circumstances, collaboration appeared the only
way out of the difficulty. I bethought myself of Mr. A. B.
Keith, who, as Boden Sanskrit scholar, had been my pupil for
four years, and who had already assisted me since 1899, not
only by reading the proofs of, but by suggesting improvements
in, my {%History of Sanskrit Literature%} and my {%Sanskrit Grammar%}
{%for Beginners,%} as well as my edition of the {%Bṛhaddevatā,%} then
commencing to be printed. I accordingly asked him if he had
the time and inclination to collaborate with me in the proposed
work by at once beginning to collect material for it. He con-
sented without hesitation, and the Secretary of State for India
readily sanctioned this modification of the arrangements already
made. There was no other man to whom I could have en-
trusted with such complete confidence the task of carrying out
this preliminary work accurately and rapidly.
<P>In 1909, about a year after my return from India, Mr. Keith
supplied me with a considerable part of his collectanea, while
my {%Vedic Grammar%} was still passing through the press. The
regular printing did not begin till early in 1910, about the time
when that work was published. The interval was taken up
with preparing a sufficient amount of ‘copy’ for the printer,
as well as with settling various questions of arrangement and
typography.
<P>{@Mode of Collaboration.@} — Our respective shares in the pro-
duction of the book are, generally stated, as follows: Dr. Keith
has collected the material, while I have acted chiefly as an
editor, planning the scope of the work, arranging the distribu-
tion of text and notes, selecting the type to be used, cutting
out, adding to or modifying the matter, weighing the evidence
for different interpretations and conclusions, and deciding as to
which view, in case of possible alternatives, should be preferred.
Having written up in its final form every article contained in
the book, I accept the responsibility for every statement and
opinion expressed in it. I do not think that Dr. Keith and I
have disagreed upon any material point. When we have differed
[Page1-vii+ 35]
on minor questions, he has deferred to my judgment, though
his view may have been right just as often as mine. Where
erroneous conclusions have been drawn, the reader will be
helped to correct them by the method I have pursued of
supplying from the original texts the evidence on which such
conclusions are based.
<P>{@Scope of the Work.@} — At the outset it was proposed, as I
have already stated, that the book should furnish the historical
material in Vedic literature as represented by proper names.
As soon, however, as I began to examine more carefully the
historical material thus available, I became convinced that
restriction to proper names would result in a harvest too
meagre to deserve being gathered in the form of a book. It
seemed essential to collect all the historical matter accessible
to us in the earliest literary documents of India, and thus to
furnish a conspectus of the most ancient phase of Aryan
civilization that can be realized by direct evidence. If properly
and thoroughly treated this matter would, I felt sure, yield a
book of genuine value, a comprehensive work on Vedic antiqui-
ties; for it would include all the information that can be
extracted from Vedic literature on such topics as agriculture,
astronomy, burial, caste, clothing, crime, diseases, economic
conditions, food and drink, gambling, kingship, law and justice,
marriage, morality, occupations, polyandry and polygamy, the
position of women, usury, village communities, war, wedding
ceremonies, widow burning, witchcraft, and many others. The
proper names would embrace not only persons, tribes, and
peoples, but also mountains, rivers, and countries. The geo-
graphical distribution of the Vedic population would thus also
be presented.
<P>From the historical data amplified in this way I proposed,
however, to exclude matter belonging to the domain of religion,
which it seemed better to relegate to a separate work. At the
same time it soon became clear that certain aspects of religious
activity inseparably connected with the social and political life
[Page1-viii+ 35]
of the age would have to be admitted, such as the functions of
the main priests and some festivals or ritual practices. Again,
certain names of perhaps purely mythological figures might
have to be mentioned. The evidence is occasionally insufficient
to show whether a name represents an actual historical person-
age: a demon or a mythical hero or priest may be meant. An
undoubted demon may even have to be included, such as the
one that is supposed to cause eclipses, because he belongs to
the domain of primitive astronomy.
<P>{@Chronological Limits.@} — The period which the book was
intended to embrace had been decided at the outset as that
of the Vedas and Brāhmaṇas. The upper limit here is the date
of the oldest hymns of the Rigveda. That date is uncertain, but
my conviction (set forth in my {%History of Sanskrit Literature,%}
pp. 11-12) that it is not much earlier than 1200 B.C. still remains
unshaken. It does not appear to me to be in the slightest degree
invalidated by Professor Hugo Winckler's discoveries at Bo-
ghaz-köi, in Asia Minor, in the year 1907. That scholar has
deciphered, in an inscription of about 1400 B.C. found there, the
names of certain deities as {%mi-it-ra, uru-w-na, in-da-ra,%} and {%na-%}
{%ša-at-ti-ia,%} which correspond to those of the important Vedic
gods Mitra, Varuṇa, Indra, and Nāsatya. Three inferences may
be drawn from the occurrence of these names. They may have
been derived from Vedic India; in that case the Vedic religion
must have flourished in India considerably before 1400 B.C.,
even though the hymns that have come down to us may not
have been composed before that date. But that these names
should have travelled all the way from India to Asia Minor
is a hypothesis so highly improbable that it may be dismissed.
Secondly, the names may belong to the early Iranian period
after the Iranians had separated from the Indians, but before
their language had reached the phonetic stage of the Avesta.
This seems the most probable theory, both chronologically and
geographically. It implies only that the Indian branch had
separated from the Iranian, not that it had already entered
[Page1-ix+ 35]
India. Lastly, the names, being common to the Iranian and
Indian languages, might be assigned to the Indo-Iranian period
when the two branches were still one people living in Iran.
This theory would still allow two centuries for separation,
migration to India, and the commencement of Vedic literature
in the north-west of India.
<P>The lower limit of the Vedic period is the epoch of the rise
and spread of Buddhism, or, roughly, 500 B.C. The Brāhmaṇa
literature to be exploited was assumed to be undoubtedly
anterior to that date. The boundary line would, however, to
some extent have to be overstepped by drawing on the Sūtras
for evidence where the Vedas and Brāhmaṇas fail. But though
the Sūtras are roughly contemporaneous with the first three
centuries of Buddhism, they are practically an epitome of the
practices of the Brāhmaṇa period, and are thus often of great
value in illustration or corroboration of the facts of that period.
They are also important as representing the Brahminical
evidence for those three centuries, especially as it is somewhat
uncertain how far even the earliest Buddhist literary sources
go back in an authentic form to the three centuries following the
death of Buddha. Names and practices not referred to before
the Sūtras were, however, to be mentioned only incidentally
if at all: the few cases to the contrary that actually occur are
not real exceptions, because they are derived from Vedic verses
quoted in Sūtras, or from Brāhmaṇa parts of Sūtras such as
Baudhāyana.
<P>{@Method Pursued.@} — Such was the scope of the work on which
I finally decided before it was begun, and the plan has been
adhered to in its execution as regards the contents. The
manner in which those contents were to be presented was
the next question to be settled and acted upon. Though both
Dr. Keith and myself are familiar with the literature of the
Vedic period from which the facts collected in these two
volumes are drawn, and the mutual check exercised by two
workers sifting the same material acts as a safeguard, it is
[Page1-x+ 35]
nevertheless not always possible to exclude the risk of error
or unconscious bias in estimating evidence often obscure and
doubtful. I have, therefore, throughout attached great im-
portance to stating not only the evidence of the texts them-
selves from a first-hand knowledge, but also to setting forth
fully the opinions of other authorities when the interpretation
is uncertain. The Sanskrit scholar will thus be enabled to
test without difficulty the correctness of the conclusions drawn
directly from the original sources, while others will be protected
from having to rely exclusively on what may possibly be one-
sided views. Articles have often been illustrated by adducing
parallels from the institutions of cognate Āryan nations, as that
on ‘Caste’ (treated under {@Varṇa,@} ii. 427-471). I have further
endeavoured to utilize, chiefly in the notes, knowledge gained
from a first-hand study of the archæological remains and of
the modern conditions of India. Such knowledge, acquired
during my tour in 1907-08, I have found to be of great value
to me both as a student and as a teacher.
<P>{@Arrangement.@} — The matter contained in these volumes is
treated not in chapters, but in articles disposed in alphabetical
order. That order was practically necessary when proper
names only were to be included; when subjects were sub-
sequently added to the plan, it still remained the most con-
venient method of arrangement. As all articles appear under
Sanskrit words, the order which the latter follow is naturally
that of the Sanskrit alphabet. This arrangement need, how-
ever, occasion no inconvenience to those users of the book who
are unfamiliar with Sanskrit, because all the information they
want can be found by reference to the full English Index at the
end of Vol. ii. The Sanskrit Index, which contains, in addition
to the terms representing the subjects treated, all incidental
Sanskrit words occurring in the articles, is of course arranged
in the Sanskrit order. For the purpose of obviating any possible
inconvenience, the sequence of the Sanskrit alphabet is given
on the last page of this preface. With the same end in view I
[Page1-xi+ 35]
have given translations or explanations of all Sanskrit words
and expressions, because the latter, though generally clear to
Sanskrit scholars, would be unintelligible to others. Compound
Sanskrit words have been divided into their component parts by
the use of hyphens. In the case of obscure or irregularly formed
Sanskrit words, I have sometimes added etymological explana-
tions, which may be useful even to the Sanskrit scholar.
<P>I have long had a rooted objection to crowding the letter-
press of a book with parentheses containing a string of references
or incidental explanations, because these distract the attention
of the reader and interfere with his grasping the argument
rapidly. I have accordingly in the present work (as in several
previous ones) cleared the text of such obstructive matter,
relegating references and minor explanations, illustrations, or
discussions, to the notes. The sole exceptions are short
references consisting of figures only, and occurring in articles
of two or three lines in length. Thus, in the article ‘Kauṣārava’
(i. 194), the figures (viii. 28) are added in parentheses at the
end of the line. To have made a footnote out of these figures
alone would have been a pedantic and an absurd application
of the general principle.
<P>The {@notes@} are placed in two columns, because this arrange-
ment enables the reader to find them more rapidly than any
other. They come at the end of, and immediately below, each
article. It is only when the article is a long one extending
beyond the first page that the notes do not all occupy this
position. Those referring to each page are then placed at the
foot of that page, and only those referring to the last page come
at the end of the article ({%cf., e.g.,%} 1. {@Akṣa@}).
<P>The {@headlines@} are so arranged as to help the reader in finding
what he wants quickly, as well as to convey the maximum of
information. A glance at the inner corners at the top will
show the alphabetical range of the articles occurring in any
two pages, the one indicating the first word on the left page,
the other the last word on the right page. The rest of the
[Page1-xii+ 35]
neadline of each page supplies a summary of the contents of
that page. I have never been able to find any rational ex-
planation why the title of the book held in one's hand should
be printed at the top of at least half, sometimes of all, the
pages it contains. How this practice can possibly assist the
reader is hard to understand.
<P>{@Typographical Details.@} — Every Sanskrit word used as the
title of an article is printed in thick type for the purpose of
catching the eye of the reader more readily. Every such word
mentioned in another article is on its first occurrence there
similarly printed. This is both a simpler and a clearer way of
referring to a word used in another place than the employ-
ment of parentheses and additional words or abbreviations, like
‘see’ or {%‘cf.,’%} which tend to distract the attention of the reader
(see, {%e.g.,%} {@Agastya@}). Both Sanskrit names (including titles of
books) and ordinary Sanskrit terms used as English words are
printed in Roman type, but then always with a capital ({%e.g.,%}
Purohita). Italic type is employed for Sanskrit words quoted
as such, for expressions from other languages such as Latin or
French, for the titles of all except Sanskrit books ({%e.g.,%} Olden-
berg, {%Buddha%}), and even of Sanskrit books when a particulal
edition is intended (thus Roth, {%Nirukta,%} but Yāska, Nirukta).
English words are italicized only when in long articles the
titles of subdivisions are given. All these uses of italics will
be found exemplified in the articles 2. {@Akṣa@} and 3. {@Akṣa.@}
<P>As regards numerals, Roman figures are employed to indicate
the main divisions of a work, the subordinate parts being
expressed by Arabic figures. Thus ‘Rigveda, ii. 3, 5,’ means
‘book 2, hymn 3, verse 5.’ The volume, on the other hand,
is referred to by an Arabic numeral, the following figure
indicating the page. Thus ‘Max Müller, {%Ṛgveda,%} 2, 135’
means ‘volume 2 of Max Müller's edition of the Rigveda,
page 135.’
<P>I have avoided abbreviating the titles of books or journals
even when they occur often, or are mentioned in the notes
[Page1-xiii+ 35]
only. Contracted titles are as a rule intelligible to the general
reader only by reference to an explanatory list appearing at
the beginning or the end of a book. When a work is written
consecutively, such an abbreviation can be looked up on its
first occurrence, and as it is usually met with again at short
intervals its explanation will be remembered. But in a book
arranged in dictionary form, the occurrence of abridged titles
becomes irksome to the reader because he meets them at any
part of the book he opens, and often many at the same time;
he will probably therefore be continually consulting the ex-
planatory list. Hence I have only admitted the contractions
‘Rv.’ for Rigveda and ‘Av.’ for Atharvaveda, as these texts are
constantly referred to, often several times in the same article.
In some works, such as the {%Encyclopœdia of Indo-Āryan Research,%}
excessively contracted titles, frequently assuming the appear-
ance of algebraic symbols, become necessary owing to the great
mass of bibliographical references required. In the present
work such economy of space was in no way called for. If,
however, the book had been intended for the use of Sanskrit
scholars only, I should certainly have shortened many titles
here given in full, for there are numerous formulaic abbrevia-
tions that are familiar to all specialists.
<P>{@Transliteration.@} — The system here followed is that which
has been adopted by the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain
and Ireland, and is generally employed elsewhere also. The
chief difficulties caused to the non-scholar by this method of
reproducing Sanskrit words are due, on the one hand, to the
inadequacy of the Roman alphabet, which necessitates the use
of diacritical marks, and, on the other, to the conventional use
of two consonants in English, in certain cases, to represent a
single sound, as {%ch, sh, ph,%} and {%th.%} The letter {%ṣ%} here is the
equivalent of {%sh%} in ‘shun’; {%ś%} is somewhat thinner in pro-
nunciation, like the {%ss%} in ‘session’; {%ṃ%} resembles the {%n%} in the
French ‘bon’; and {%ḥ%} the German {%ch%} in ‘ach.’ The palatal {%c%}
is to be sounded like the initial {%ch%} in Churchill; {%ch%} has an
[Page1-xiv+ 35]
aspirate sound like that of the {%ch%} in the middle of the same
word; {%ph%} and {%th%} are also aspirates, as in the English ‘up-hill’
and ‘ant-hill’ respectively. The vowels must all be pro-
nounced as in Italian: short when unmarked (except {%e%} and {%o,%}
which are always long), long when they have a horizontal
stroke above; thus {%i%} is sounded as in ‘pin,’ {%ī%} like {%ee%} in ‘seen.’
The vowel {%ṛ%} may be pronounced like {%ri%} in ‘risk.’
<P>{@The Map.@} — In order that the reader may be enabled to
visualize in a general way the territory known to and occupied
by the Vedic tribes, I have prefixed to the first volume a map
of Vedic India. Here the home of the Indo-Aryans of the
earliest period — that of the Rigveda — is the territory drained
by the Indus river system, lying between the 35th and 28th
parallel of northern latitude and between 70° and 78° eastern
longitude, and corresponding roughly to the North-West
Frontier Province and the Panjab of the present day. The
eastern limit was probably the Yamunā, though the Ganges
was already known. In the subsequent Vedic period — that
of the later Vedas and of the Brāhmaṇas — the Indo-Āryan
settlers gradually occupied the whole of the Ganges Valley
down to the delta of that river. But the home of the fully
developed culture of the Brāhmaṇas lay in the territory ex-
tending in a south-easterly direction from longitude 74° to
85°, between the confluence of the Sarasvatī and Dṛṣadvatī
in the west and that of the Sadānīrā and Ganges on the east,
and embracing roughly the south-eastern portion of the Panjab
and the United Provinces of to-day. East of longitude 85°
lay, to the north and south of the Ganges, the imperfectly
Brahminized country corresponding to the modern Tirhut and
Bihār, where Buddhism arose at the end of the Vedic period.
<P>I ought to warn readers against placing too much reliance
on the details of this map, because it is largely conjectural
owing to the lack of precise geographical statement in the
texts. The student, when using it, should always refer to the
evidence furnished by the articles under each name that appears
[Page1-xv+ 35]
on the map. The identification of many of the Vedic rivers
with those of modern India is certain; but even here the exact
channels in which they flowed in ancient times is doubtful.
Thus the Indus, some of the Panjab rivers, and the old
Sarasvatī have been shown by Raverty, in an article in the
{%Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal%} for 1892, to have changed
their courses considerably, even within historical times. It
must be remembered that all the rivers of Vedic India traversed
the alluvial plains of the north, and were, therefore, unlike the
rivers of the Deccan, which flow in rocky beds, liable to constant
fluctuations in their channels. Again, the Vedic tribes are
nearly always mentioned so vaguely in the texts that they can
only be approximately located by the rivers with which they
are connected, or by the way in which their names are asso-
ciated or grouped. Many such names had to be omitted
altogether in the map because of the total lack of evidence
for their localization. Some help may be obtained from the
geographical position in the post-Vedic period of tribes men-
tioned in Vedic literature. But this evidence is apt to be
doubtful, because the Vedic period was largely one of migra-
tion, and various tribes may then have occupied localities
much farther north or west than those in which they were
later permanently settled. The general evidence of the map,
however uncertain many of the details may be, leaves no room
for doubt as to the route by which the Āryans entered India,
or as to the direction of the successive stages of the migration
by which they eventually spread their civilization over the
whole of the peninsula.
<P>{@Conclusion.@} — The first volume was ready for issue more than
a year ago, but to publish it without the indexes, which would
necessarily have to appear at the end of the second volume,
seemed to me to be perfectly useless. I therefore preferred
to wait till the whole book could be brought out in a complete
form. As both Dr. Keith and myself have each read one proof
and nearly always two revises of every sheet before it went to
[Page1-xvi+ 12]
press, all but trivial errors and misprints ought to have been
eliminated. I hope, however, that these two volumes will
prove to be not only correct in form, but also valuable in
matter, after our joint efforts to bring together and present
their contents in a convenient and trustworthy manner.

{@Puruṣa,@}¦ or {@Pūruṣa,@} is the generic term for ‘man’ in the
Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later.<sup>2</sup> Man is composed of five parts accord-
ing to the Atharvaveda,<sup>3</sup> or of six according to the Aitareya
Brāhmaṇa,<sup>4</sup> or of sixteen,<sup>5</sup> or of twenty,<sup>6</sup> or of twenty-one,<sup>7</sup>
or of twenty-four,<sup>8</sup> or of twenty-five,<sup>9</sup> all more or less fanciful
enumerations. Man is the first of animals,<sup>10</sup> but also essentially
an animal (see {@Paśu@}). The height of a man is given in the
Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra<sup>11</sup> as four Aratnis (‘cubits’) , each of two
Padas (‘feet’), each of twelve Aṅgulis (‘finger's breadths’); and
the term Puruṣa itself is found earlier<sup>12</sup> as a measure of length.
<div n="P"/>Puruṣa is also applied to denote the length of a man's life,
a ‘generation’;<sup>13</sup> the ‘pupil’ in the eye;<sup>14</sup> and in the gram-
matical literature the ‘person’ of the verb.<sup>15</sup>

{@Puro-hita@}¦ (‘placed in front,’ ‘appointed’) is the name of a
priest in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later.<sup>2</sup> The office of Purohita is
called Purohiti<sup>3</sup> and {@Purodhā.@} It is clear that the primary
function of the Purohita was that of ‘domestic priest’ of a
king, or perhaps a great noble; his quite exceptional position
is shown by the fact that only one Purohita seems ever to be
mentioned in Vedic literature.<sup>4</sup> Examples of Purohitas in the
Rigveda are {@Viśvāmitra@}<sup>5</sup> or {@Vasiṣṭha@}<sup>6</sup> in the service of the
{@Bharata@} king; {@Sudās,@} of the {@Tṛtsu@} family; the Purohita of
{@Kuruśravaṇa;@}<sup>7</sup> and {@Devāpi,@} the Purohita of {@Śantanu.@}<sup>8</sup> The
Purohita was in all religious matters the {%alter ego%} of the king.
In the ritual<sup>9</sup> it is laid down that a king must have a Purohita,
else the gods will not accept his offerings. He ensures the
king's safety and victory in battle by his prayers;<sup>10</sup> he procures
[Page2-006+ 56]
the fall of rain for the crops;<sup>11</sup> he is the flaming fire that
guards the kingdom.<sup>12</sup> Divodāsa in trouble is rescued by
Bharadvāja;<sup>13</sup> and King {@Tryaruṇa Traidhātva Aikṣvāka@}
reproaches his Purohita, {@Vṛśa Jāna,@} when his car runs over
a Brahmin boy and kills him.<sup>14</sup> The close relation of king and
Purohita is illustrated by the case of {@Kutsa Aurava,@} who slew
his Purohita, {@Upagu Sauśravasa,@} for disloyalty in serving
Indra, to whom Kutsa was hostile.<sup>15</sup> Other disputes between
kings and priests who officiated for them are those of {@Janam-@}
{@ejaya@} and the {@Kaśyapas,@} and of {@Viśvantara@} and the {@Śyā-@}
{@parṇas;@}<sup>16</sup> and between {@Asamāti@} and the {@Gaupāyanas.@}<sup>17</sup> In
some cases one Purohita served more than one king; for
example, {@Devabhāga Śrautarṣa@} was the Purohita of the
{@Kurus@} and the {@Sṛṅjayas@} at the same time,<sup>18</sup> and {@Jala Jātū-@}
{@karṇya@} was the Purohita of the kings of {@Kāśi, Videha,@} and
{@Kosala.@}<sup>19</sup>
<div n="P"/>There is no certain proof that the office of Purohita was
hereditary in a family, though it probably was so.<sup>20</sup> At any
rate, it seems clear from the relations of the Purohita with
King {@Kuruśravaṇa,@} and with his son {@Upamaśravas,@}<sup>21</sup> that a
king would keep on the Purohita of his father.
<div n="P"/>Zimmer<sup>22</sup> thinks that the king might act as his own Purohita,
as shown by the case of King Viśvantara, who sacrificed with-
out the help of the Śyāparṇas,<sup>23</sup> and that a Purohita need not
be a priest, as shown by the case of Devāpi and Śantanu.<sup>24</sup>
But neither opinion seems to be justified. It is not said that
[Page2-007+ 63]
Viśvantara sacrificed without priests, while Devāpi is not
regarded as a king until the Nirukta,<sup>25</sup> and there is no
reason to suppose that Yāska's view expressed in that work
is correct.
<div n="P"/>According to Geldner,<sup>26</sup> the Purohita from the beginning
acted as the Brahman priest in the sacrificial ritual, being
there the general superintendent of the sacrifice. In favour of
this view, he cites the fact that Vasiṣṭha is mentioned both as
Purohita<sup>27</sup> and as Brahman:<sup>28</sup> at the sacrifice of {@Śunaḥśepa@} he
served as Brahman,<sup>29</sup> but he was the Purohita of Sudās;<sup>30</sup>
Bṛhaspati is called the Purohita<sup>31</sup> and the Brahman<sup>32</sup> of the
gods; and the Vasiṣṭhas who are Purohitas are also the Brah-
mans at the sacrifice.<sup>33</sup> It is thus clear that the Brahman was
often the Purohita; and it was natural that this should be the
case when once the Brahman's place became, as it did in the
later ritual, the most important position at the sacrifice.<sup>34</sup> But
the Brahman can hardly be said to have held this place in the
earlier ritual; Oldenberg<sup>35</sup> seems to be right in holding that
the Purohita was originally the Hotṛ priest, the singer {%par%}
{%excellence,%} when he took any part at all in the ritual of the great
sacrifices with the {@Ṛtvijs.@} So Devāpi seems clearly to have
[Page2-008+ 54]
been a Hotṛ;<sup>36</sup> Agni is at once Purohita<sup>37</sup> and Hotṛ;<sup>38</sup> and the
‘two divine Hotṛs’ referred to in the Āprī litanies are also
called the ‘two Purohitas.’<sup>39</sup> Later, no doubt, when the
priestly activity ceased to centre in the song, the Purohita, with
his skill in magic, became the Brahman, who also required
magic to undo the errors of the sacrifice.<sup>40</sup>
<div n="P"/>There is little doubt that in the original growth of the priest-
hood the Purohita played a considerable part. In historical
times he represented the real power of the kingship, and may
safely be deemed to have exercised great influence in all public
affairs, such as the administration of justice and the king's
conduct of business. But it is not at all probable that the
Purohita represents, as Roth<sup>41</sup> and Zimmer<sup>42</sup> thought, the
source which gave rise to caste. The priestly class is already
in existence in the Rigveda (see {@Varṇa@}).

who gives the tale of the Gaupāyanas
and King Asamāti from the Śāṭyāya-
naka, and comparing the case of
Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra as Purohitas,
probably contemporaneously, of Sudās.
But that the two were contemporaneous
is most unlikely, especially if we adopt
the very probable view of Hopkins
({%Journal of the American Oriental Society,%}
15, 260 {%et seq.%}) that Viśvāmitra was
with the ten kings (Rv. vii. 18) when
they unsuccessfully attacked Sudās.
The other narrative has, as Oldenberg,
{%Religion des Veda,%} 375, n. 3, observes,
a markedly fictitious character; while
every other passage that mentions a
Purohita speaks of him in the singular,
and as there was only one Brahman
priest at the sacrifice, so the Purohita
acted as Brahman.</F>

{@Pūru@}¦ is the name of a people and their king in the Rigveda.
They are mentioned with the {@Anus, Druhyus, Turvaśas,@}
and {@Yadus@} in one passage.<sup>1</sup> They also occur as enemies of
the {@Tṛtsus@} in the hymn of {@Sudās’@} victory.<sup>2</sup> In another
[Page2-012+ 48]
hymn<sup>3</sup> Agni of the {@Bharatas@} is celebrated as victorious over the
Pūrus, probably a reference to the same decisive overthrow.
On the other hand, victories of the Pūrus over the aborigines
seem to be referred to in several passages.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>The great kings of the Pūrus were {@Purukutsa@} and his son
{@Trasadasyu,@} whose name bears testimony to his prowess
against aboriginal foes, while a later prince was {@Tṛkṣi Trāsa-@}
{@dasyava.@}
<div n="P"/>In the Rigveda the Pūrus are expressly<sup>5</sup> mentioned as on
the {@Sarasvatī.@} Zimmer<sup>6</sup> thinks that the {@Sindhu@} (Indus) is
meant in this passage. But Ludwig<sup>7</sup> and Hillebrandt<sup>8</sup> with
much greater probability think that the eastern Sarasvatī in
Kurukṣetra is meant. This view accords well with the sudden
disappearance of the name of the Pūrus from Vedic tradition,
a disappearance accounted for by Oldenberg's<sup>9</sup> conjecture that
the Pūrus became part of the great Kuru people, just as
{@Turvaśa@} and {@Krivi@} disappear from the tradition on their being
merged in the {@Pañcāla@} nation. Trāsadasyava, the patronymic
of {@Kuruśravaṇa@} in the Rigveda,<sup>10</sup> shows that the royal
families of the Kurus and the Pūrus were allied by inter-
marriage.
<div n="P"/>Hillebrandt,<sup>11</sup> admitting that the Pūrus in later times lived
in the eastern country round the Sarasvatī, thinks that in
earlier days they were to be found to the west of the Indus
with {@Divodāsa.@} This theory must fall with the theory that
Divodāsa was in the far west. It might, however, be held to
be supported by the fact that Alexander found a <lang n="greek">Πῶρος</lang> — that
is, a Paurava prince on the Hydaspes,<sup>12</sup> a sort of half-way
locality between the Sarasvatī and the West. But it is quite
simple to suppose either that the Hydaspes was the earlier
home of the Pūrus, where some remained after the others had
[Page2-013+ 52]
wandered east, or that the later Paurava represents a success-
ful onslaught upon the west from the east.
<div n="P"/>In several other passages of the Rigveda<sup>13</sup> the Pūrus as a
people seem to be meant. The Nirukta<sup>14</sup> recognizes the general
sense of ‘man,’ but in no passage is this really necessary or
even probable. So utterly, however, is the tradition lost that
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>15</sup> explains Pūru in the Rigveda<sup>16</sup> as
an Asura Rakṣas; it is only in the Epic that Pūru revives as
the name of a son of Yayāti and Śarmiṣṭhā.<sup>17</sup>

the words {%vidathe mṛdhravācam%} generally

Śrauta Sūtra<sup>2</sup> as a patron of {@Praskaṇva,@} and called Pṛṣadhra
Medhya Mātariśvan (or Mātariśva); but for once there is a
discrepancy between the statement of the Sūtra and the text
of the Rigveda, for the hymns<sup>3</sup> there attributed to Praskaṇva
as in praise of Pṛṣadhra have nothing in them connected with
Pṛṣadhra, while the Anukramaṇī (Index) ascribes to Pṛṣadhra
himself the authorship of one of them.<sup>4</sup> On the other hand,

{@Petva@}¦ is found twice in the Atharvaveda.<sup>1</sup> In the first
passage reference is made to its {%vāja,%} which Zimmer<sup>2</sup> argues
can only mean ‘strength,’ ‘swiftness,’ though naturally the
sense of ‘male power’ would seem more appropriate in a spell
intended to remove lack of virility. In the second passage the
Petva is mentioned as overcoming the horse (see {@Ubhayādant@}),
a miracle which has a parallel in the Rigveda,<sup>3</sup> where the
Petva overcomes the female<sup>4</sup> lion. The animal also occurs in
the list of victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the
Yajurveda Saṃhitās,<sup>5</sup> and occasionally elsewhere.<sup>6</sup> It appears
to be the ‘ram’ or the ‘wether,’ the latter<sup>7</sup> being the sense
given to it by the commentator on the Taittirīya Saṃhitā.
But there is no conclusive evidence in favour of this meaning,
while on the whole the passage of the Atharvaveda, in which
{%vāja%} is found, accords best with the sense of ‘ram.’ Hopkins,<sup>8</sup>
however, renders the word as ‘goat,’ though for what reason is
not clear. Whether it is connected in any way with {@Pitva@} or

occurs in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad<sup>2</sup> as that of a despised
race of men, together with the Cāṇḍāla. The Maitrāyaṇī
Saṃhitā<sup>3</sup> has the variant Puklaka or Pulkaka, clearly the same
as Pulkasa, of which Paulkasa is a derivative form, showing
that a caste is meant ({%cf.%} {@Kaulāla, Pauñjiṣṭha@}). In the accepted
theory<sup>4</sup> the Pulkasa is the son of a Niṣāda or Śūdra by a
Kṣatriya woman, but this is merely speculative; the Paulkasa
may either have been a functional caste, or, as Fick<sup>5</sup> believes,
an aboriginal clan living by catching wild beasts, and only
occasionally reduced to menial tasks.

could be remedied; and as finding {@Alīkayu Vācaspata,@} the
Brahman priest at the sacrifice, unable to say what was to be

done. In the Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad<sup>3</sup> it is said that Pratardana
Daivodāsi went to Indra's world through his death in battle.
The patronymic connects him with {@Divodāsa,@} the ancestor or
father of {@Sudās,@} and the mention of Bharadvāja (probably ‘a
Bharadvāja’ is meant) as his priest supports the patronymic,
for Divodāsa is a special favourite of the singers of the Bharad-

Tṛtsus (the root {%tard%} appears in both) and of the {%Pratṛdaḥ%} (see

the passage refers to a raid against the Kīkaṭas, who were not
observers of the milk cult or the Soma cult, with the intention
of winning their lands where the Soma grew and where there
were cows. Böhtlingk,<sup>4</sup> however, questions this view, which is
not very probable. A place name is possibly meant by Naicā-
śākha.<sup>5</sup> The name Pramaganda seems un-Āryan.

two breasts are added. Exactly what organs are taken to
make up the numbers beyond seven is not certain.<sup>23</sup> The tenth
is the navel ({%nābhi%}) in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā;<sup>24</sup> when eleven
are named the Brahma-randhra<sup>25</sup> (suture in the crown) may be
included; in the Atharvaveda,<sup>26</sup> as interpreted by the Bṛhad-

breath, even when opposed to Apāna.<sup>30</sup> But its proper sense
is beyond question ‘breathing forth,’ ‘expiration,’ and not as

a version due to the desire to interpret Apāna as ‘expiration,’
a meaning suggested by the preposition {%apa,%} ‘away.’ This

<L>2144<pc>2-062<k1>bali<k2>bali
{@Bali@}¦ occurs several times in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and often later<sup>2</sup>
in the sense of tribute to a king or offering to a god. Zimmer<sup>3</sup>
thinks that the offerings were in both cases voluntary. He
compares the notices of the Germans in Tacitus,<sup>4</sup> where the
kings of the tribes are said to receive gifts in kind as presents,
but not a regular tribute. There seems to be no ground what-
ever for this view. No doubt in origin the prerogatives of
monarchy were due to voluntary action on the part of the
tribesmen,<sup>5</sup> but that the Vedic peoples, who were essentially
a body of conquering invaders, were in this state is most
improbable, and the attitude of the Vedic Indian to his gods
was at least as compatible with tribute as with voluntary gifts.
Zimmer admits that in the case of hostile tribes<sup>6</sup> tribute must
be meant even in the Rigveda. See also {@Rājan.@}

2. {@Balhika Prātipīya@}¦ is the name of a {@Kuru@} king in the
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>1</sup> where he appears as having been opposed
to the restoration of {@Duṣṭarītu Pauṃsāyana@} to his hereditary
sovereignty over the {@Sṛñjayas,@} but as having failed to prevent
[Page2-064+ 49]
the restoration being carried out by {@Revottaras Pāṭava Cākra@}
{@Sthapati.@} The epithet Prātipīya is curious: if it connects him
with {@Pratīpa@} (whose son he is in the Epic), the form is
remarkable, Zimmer<sup>2</sup> indeed tacitly altering it to Prātīpīya.
In the Epic and the Purāṇas<sup>3</sup> he is in the form of Vāhlīka
made a brother of {@Devāpi@} and {@Śantanu,@} and a son of Pratīpa.
To base chronological conclusions on this<sup>4</sup> would be utterly
misleading, for the facts are that Devāpi was son of Ṛṣṭiṣeṇa
and a priest, while Śantanu was a Kuru prince of unknown
parentage, but not probably a son of Pratīpa, who seems to be
a late figure in the Vedic age, later than {@Parikṣit,@} being his
great-grandson in the Epic. Very possibly Balhika was a
descendant of Pratīpa. Why he bore the name Balhika
must remain uncertain, for there is no evidence of any sort
regarding it.

mean a merchant in a good sense, Bṛbu being then a merchant
prince.<sup>4</sup> According to Weber,<sup>5</sup> the name suggests connexion
with Babylon, but this conjecture must be regarded as

{@Brahma-carya@}¦ denotes the condition of life of the {@Brahma-@}
{@cārin@}<sup>1</sup> or religious student. The technical sense is first found in
[Page2-075+ 70]
the last Maṇḍala of the Rigveda.<sup>2</sup> The practice of studentship
doubtless developed, and was more strictly regulated by custom
as time went on, but it is regularly assumed and discussed in
the later Vedic literature, being obviously a necessary part of
Vedic society
<div n="P"/>The Atharvaveda<sup>3</sup> has in honour of the Brahmacārin a hymn
which already gives all the characteristic features of religious
studentship. The youth is initiated ({%upa-nī%}) by the teacher<sup>4</sup>
into a new life; he wears an antelope skin, and lets his hair
grow long;<sup>5</sup> he collects fuel,<sup>6</sup> and begs,<sup>7</sup> learns, and practises
penance. All these characteristics appear in the later literature.
The student lives in the house of his teacher ({%ācārya-kula-vāsin;%}<sup>8</sup>
{%ante-vāsin%});<sup>9</sup> he begs,<sup>10</sup> looks after the sacrificial fires,<sup>11</sup> and
tends the house.<sup>12</sup> His term of studentship might be long
extended: it was normally fixed at twelve years,<sup>13</sup> but much
longer periods, such as thirty-two years, are mentioned.<sup>14</sup> The
[Page2-076+ 56]
age at which studentship began varied.<sup>15</sup> {@Śvetaketu@} com-
menced at twelve and studied for twelve years.<sup>16</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is assumed in the Gṛhya Sūtras that the three Āryan castes
were all required to pass through a period of studentship. But
that this is much more than priestly schematism is uncertain.
No doubt individuals of the {@Kṣatriya@} or {@Vaiśya@} caste might go
through part of the period of studentship, just as Burmese boys
of all classes now pass some time in a monastery as students.
This is borne out by the reference in the Atharvaveda<sup>17</sup> to the
king guarding his country by Brahmacarya — though that is
susceptible of a different interpretation — and more clearly by
the reference in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>18</sup> to a rite intended to
benefit one who, although not a Brahmin, had studied ({%vidyām%}
{%anūcya%}), but had not gained renown, and by references in the
Upaniṣads to kings who like {@Janaka@} studied the Vedas and the
Upaniṣads.<sup>19</sup> Normally, however, the Kṣatriya studied the art
of war.<sup>20</sup>
<div n="P"/>One of the duties of the Brahmacārin was chastity. But
reference is in several places<sup>21</sup> made to the possibility of mis-
conduct between a student and the wife of his preceptor, nor is
any very severe penance imposed in early times — later it is
different — for such a sin. In certain cases the ritual required
a breach of chastity, no doubt as a magic spell to secure
fertility.<sup>22</sup>
<div n="P"/>Even an old man might on occasion become a pupil, as the
story of {@Āruṇi@} shows.<sup>23</sup>

ages 8-16; for a Kṣatriya, 11-22; for a
Vaiśya, 12-24. The difference between
the Brāhmaṇa and the Kṣatriya, com-
pared with that between the Kṣatriya
and the Vaiśya, shows that the two
latter castes were in a different position

2. {@Brahman@}¦ is found in many passages of the Rigveda and
later in the sense of ‘priest.’ In many passages of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup>
he is referred to as praising the gods; in others<sup>2</sup> the sense of
‘priest’ is adequate. In not a few cases<sup>3</sup> the priesthood as a
profession is clearly alluded to, nor is there any reason to doubt<sup>4</sup>
that in all cases the word has the technical sense of a member
of the priesthood. There is, however, considerable doubt as to
the number of cases in the Rigveda, where it has the technical
[Page2-078+ 60]
sense of the priest who guides the sacrifice generally. It is
undoubtedly found in that sense, both Muir<sup>5</sup> and Roth<sup>6</sup>
recognizing instances of its being used thus. Geldner,<sup>7</sup> how-
ever, is anxious to find that sense in a large number of passages,
and insists that the {@Purohita@} was normally a Brahman in the
narrower sense. Oldenberg,<sup>8</sup> on the other hand, holds with
greater probability that in most of the passages adduced
Brahman means simply ‘priest,’ and that the Purohita, who
was essentially not a member of the ordinary body of sacri-
ficing priests ({@Ṛtvij@}), was, when he officiated at the sacrifice,
more usually the Hotṛ priest, and only later became the
Brahman. This change he regards as having taken place when
the importance of the hymns declined, and most weight was
laid on the functions of the priest who superintended the sacrifice
as a whole, and by his magic repaired the flaws in the sacrifice.<sup>9</sup>
In the later literature both senses of the word are quite
common.<sup>10</sup>

1. {@Brāhmaṇa,@}¦ ‘descendant of a Brahman’ ({%i.e.,%} of a priest), is
found only a few times in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> and mostly in its latest
[Page2-081+ 64]
parts. In the Atharvaveda<sup>2</sup> and later<sup>3</sup> it is a very common
word denoting ‘priest,’ and it appears in the quadruple division
of the castes in the Puruṣa-sūkta (‘hymn of man’) of the
Rigveda.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>It seems certain that in the Rigveda this Brāhmaṇa, or
Brahmin, is already a separate caste, differing from the warrior
and agricultural castes.<sup>5</sup> The texts regularly claim for them a
superiority to the {@Kṣatriya@} caste,<sup>6</sup> and the Brahmin is able by
his spells or manipulation of the rite to embroil the people and
the warriors<sup>7</sup> or the different sections of the warriors.<sup>8</sup> If it
is necessary to recognize, as is sometimes done, that the
Brahmin does pay homage to the king at the {@Rājasūya,@}<sup>9</sup>
nevertheless the unusual fact is carefully explained away so
as to leave the priority of the Brahmin unaffected. But it
is expressly recognized that the union of the Kṣatriya and
the Brāhmaṇa is essential for complete prosperity.<sup>10</sup> It is
admitted<sup>11</sup> that the king or the nobles might at times oppress
the Brahmins, but it is indicated that ruin is then certain
swiftly to follow.
[Page2-082+ 55]
<div n="P"/>The Brahmins are gods on earth,<sup>12</sup> like the gods in heaven,
but this claim is hardly found in the Rigveda.<sup>13</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>14</sup> the Brahmin is said to be the
‘recipient of gifts’ ({%ādāyī%}) and the ‘drinker of the offering’
({%āpāyī%}). The other two epithets applied, {%āvasāyī%} and {%yathā-%}
{%kāma-prayāpya,%} are more obscure; the former denotes either
‘dwelling everywhere’<sup>15</sup> or ‘seeking food’;<sup>16</sup> the latter is usually
taken as ‘moving at pleasure,’ but it must rather allude to the
power of the king to assign a place of residence to the Brahmin.
<div n="P"/>In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>17</sup> the prerogatives of the Brah-
min are summed up as (1) Arcā, ‘honour’; (2) Dāna, ‘gifts’;
(3) Ajyeyatā, ‘freedom from oppression’; and (4) Avadhyatā,
‘freedom from being killed.’ On the other hand, his duties
are summed up as (5) Brāhmaṇya, ‘purity of descent’;
(6) Pratirūpa-caryā, ‘devotion of the duties of his caste’; and
(7) Loka-pakti, ‘the perfecting of people’ (by teaching).
<div n="P"/>1. {%Respect paid to Brahmins.%} — The texts are full<sup>18</sup> of references
to the civilities to be paid to the Brahmin. He is styled
{%bhagavant,%}<sup>19</sup> and is provided with good food<sup>20</sup> and entertain-
ment wherever he goes. Indeed, his sanctity exempts him
from any close inquiry into his real claim to Brahminhood
according to the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.<sup>21</sup>
<div n="P"/>2. {%Gifts to Brahmins.%} — The Dānastuti (‘Praise of gifts’) is a
recognized feature of the Rigveda, and the greed of the poets
for {@Dakṣiṇās,@} or sacrificial fees, is notorious. Vedic texts<sup>22</sup>
themselves recognize that the literature thence resulting ({@Nārā-@}
[Page2-083+ 56]
{@śaṃsī@}) was often false to please the donors. It was, however,
a rule<sup>23</sup> that Brahmins should not accept what had been
refused by others; this indicates a keen sense of the danger of
cheapening their wares. So exclusively theirs was the right to
receive gifts that the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>24</sup> has to explain
how {@Taranta@} and {@Purumīḷha@} became able to accept gifts by
composing a Rigvedic hymn.<sup>25</sup> The exaggerations in the
celebration of the gifts bestowed on the priests has the curious
result of giving us a series of numerals of some interest ({@Daśan@}).
In some passages<sup>26</sup> certain gifts — those of a horse or sheep — are
forbidden, but this rule was not, it is clear, generally observed.
<div n="P"/>3. {%Immunities of Brahmins.%} — The Brahmin claimed to be
exempt from the ordinary exercise of the royal power. When
a king gives all his land and what is on it to the priests, the gift
does not cover the property of the Brahmin according to the
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>27</sup> The king censures all, but not the
Brahmin,<sup>28</sup> nor can he safely oppress any Brahmin other than
an ignorant priest.<sup>29</sup> An arbitrator (or a witness) must decide
(or speak) for a Brahmin against a non-Brahmin in a legal
dispute.<sup>30</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Brahmin's proper food is the {@Soma,@}<sup>31</sup> not {@Surā@}<sup>32</sup> or
{@Parisrut,@}<sup>33</sup> and he is forbidden to eat certain forms of flesh.<sup>34</sup>
On the other hand, he alone is allowed to eat the remains of
the sacrifice,<sup>35</sup> for no one else is sufficiently holy to consume
food which the gods have eaten. Moreover, though he cannot
be a physician,<sup>36</sup> he helps the physician by being beside him
[Page2-084+ 56]
while he exercises his art.<sup>37</sup> His wife<sup>38</sup> and his cow<sup>39</sup> are both
sacred.
<div n="P"/>4. {%Legal Position of Brahmins.%} — The Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>40</sup>
lays down a penalty of a hundred (the unit meant is unknown)
for an insult to a Brahmin, and of a thousand for a blow; but
if his blood is drawn, the penalty is a spiritual one. The only
real murder is the slaying of a Brahmin according to the
Satapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>41</sup> The crime of slaying a Brahmin ranks
above the sin of killing any other man, but below that of killing
an embryo ({%bhrūṇa%}) in the Yajurveda;<sup>42</sup> the crime of slaying an
embryo whose sex is uncertain is on a level with that of slaying
a Brahmin.<sup>43</sup> The murder of a Brahmin can be expiated only
by the horse sacrifice,<sup>44</sup> or by a lesser rite in the late Taittirīya
Āraṇyaka.<sup>45</sup> The ritual slaying of a Brahmin is allowed in the
later ceremonial,<sup>46</sup> and hinted at in the curious legend of
{@Śunaḥśepa;@}<sup>47</sup> and a Purohita might be punished with death for
treachery to his master.<sup>48</sup>
<div n="P"/>5. {%Purity of Birth.%} — The importance of pure descent is seen
in the stress laid on being a descendant of a Ṛṣi ({%ārṣeya%}).<sup>49</sup> But,
on the other hand, there are clear traces of another doctrine,
which requires learning, and not physical descent, as the true
criterion of Ṛṣihood.<sup>50</sup> In agreement with this is the fact
that {@Satyakāma Jābāla@} was received as a pupil, though his
parentage was unknown, his mother being a slave girl who had
been connected with several men,<sup>51</sup> and that in the Śatapatha
[Page2-085+ 59]
Brāhmaṇa<sup>52</sup> the ceremony on acceptance as a pupil required
merely the name of the pupil. So {@Kavaṣa@} is taunted in the
Rigveda Brāhmaṇas<sup>53</sup> as being the son of a female slave ({@Dāsī@}),
and {@Vatsa@} cleared himself of a similar imputation by a fire
ordeal.<sup>54</sup> Moreover, a very simple rite was adequate to remove
doubts as to origin.<sup>55</sup> In these circumstances it is doubtful
whether much value attaches to the {@Pravara@} lists in which the
ancestors of the priest were invoked at the beginning of the
sacrifice by the Hotṛ and the Adhvaryu priests.<sup>56</sup> Still, in
many parts of the ritual the knowledge of two or more genera-
tions was needed,<sup>57</sup> and in one ceremony<sup>58</sup> ten ancestors who
have drunk the Soma are required, but a literal performance of
the rite is excused. Moreover, there are clear traces of ritual
variations in schools, like those of the {@Vasiṣṭhas@} and the
{@Viśvāmitras.@}
<div n="P"/>6. {%The Conduct of the Brahmin.%} — The Brahmin was required
to maintain a fair standard of excellence.<sup>59</sup> He was to be kind
to all<sup>60</sup> and gentle,<sup>61</sup> offering sacrifice and receiving gifts.<sup>62</sup>
Especial stress was laid on purity of speech;<sup>63</sup> thus {@Viśvan-@}
{@tara's@} excuse for excluding the {@Śyāparṇas@} from his retinue was
their impure ({%apūtā%}) speech.<sup>64</sup> Theirs was the craving for
knowledge<sup>65</sup> and the life of begging.<sup>66</sup> False Brahmins are
those who do not fulfil their duties<sup>67</sup> ({%cf.%} {@Brahmabandhu@}) .
[Page2-086+ 58]
But the penances for breach of duty are, in the Sūtras, of a
very light and unimportant character.<sup>68</sup>
<div n="P"/>7. {%Brahminical Studies.%} — The aim of the priest is to obtain
pre-eminence in sacred knowledge ({%brahma-varcasam%}), as is
stated in numerous passages of Vedic literature.<sup>69</sup> Such
distinction is not indeed confined to the Brahmin: the king
has it also, but it is not really in a special manner appropriate
to the Kṣatriya.<sup>70</sup> Many ritual acts are specified as leading to
Brahmavarcasa,<sup>71</sup> but more stress is laid on the study of the
sacred texts: the importance of such study is repeatedly
insisted upon.<sup>72</sup>
<div n="P"/>The technical name for study is Svādhyāya: the Satapatha
Brāhmaṇa is eloquent upon its advantages,<sup>73</sup> and it is asserted
that the joy of the learned Śrotriya, or ‘student,’ is equal to
the highest joy possible.<sup>74</sup> {@Nāka Maudgalya@} held that study
and the teaching of others were the true penance ({%tapas%}).<sup>75</sup> The
object was the ‘threefold knowledge’ ({%trayī vidyā%}), that of the
Ṛc, Yajus, and Sāman,<sup>76</sup> a student of all three Vedas being
called {%tri-śukriya%}<sup>77</sup> or {%tri-śukra,%}<sup>78</sup> ‘thrice pure.’ Other objects
of study are enumerated in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>79</sup> in the
Taittirīya Āraṇyaka,<sup>80</sup> the Chāndogya Upaniṣad,<sup>81</sup> etc. (See
{@Itihāsa, Purāṇa; Gāthā, Nārāśaṃsī; Brahmodya; Anuśās-@}
{@ana, Anuvyākhyāna, Anvākhyāna, Kalpa,@} 2. {@Brāhmaṇa;@}
{@Vidyā, Kṣatravidyā, Devajanavidyā, Nakṣatravidyā, Bhūta-@}
{@vidyā, Sarpavidyā; Atharvāṅgirasaḥ, Daiva, Nidhi, Pitrya,@}
{@Rāśi; Sūtra,@} etc.)
[Page2-087+ 55]
<div n="P"/>Directions as to the exact place and time of study are given
in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka<sup>82</sup> and in the Sūtras. If study is
carried on in the village, it is to be done silently ({%manasā%}); if
outside, aloud ({%vācā%}).
<div n="P"/>Learning is expected even from persons not normally com-
petent as teachers, such as the {@Carakas,@} who are recognized in
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>83</sup> as possible sources of information.
Here, too, may be mentioned the cases of Brahmins learning
from princes, though their absolute value is doubtful, for the
priests would naturally represent their patrons as interested in
their sacred science: it is thus not necessary to see in these
notices any real and independent study on the part of the
Kṣatriyas.<sup>84</sup> {@Yājñavalkya@} learnt from {@Janaka,@}<sup>85</sup> {@Uddālaka@}
{@Āruṇi@} and two other Brahmins from {@Pravāhaṇa Jaivali,@}<sup>86</sup>
{@Dṛptabālāki Gārgya@} from {@Ajātaśatru,@}<sup>87</sup> and five Brahmins
under the lead of Aruṇa from {@Aśvapati Kaikeya.@}<sup>88</sup> A few
notices show the real educators of thought: wandering scholars
went through the country<sup>89</sup> and engaged in disputes and
discussions in which a prize was staked by the disputants.<sup>90</sup>
Moreover, kings like Janaka offered rewards to the most learned
of the Brahmins;<sup>91</sup> Ajātaśatru was jealous of his renown, and
imitated his generosity. Again, learned women are several
times mentioned in the Brāhmaṇas.<sup>92</sup>
<div n="P"/>A special form of disputation was the {@Brahmodya,@} for which
there was a regular place at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’)<sup>93</sup>
and at the Daśarātra (‘ten-day festival’).<sup>94</sup> The reward of
learning was the gaining of the title of Kavi or Vipra, ‘sage.’<sup>95</sup>
[Page2-088+ 56]
<div n="P"/>8. {%The Functions of the Brahmin.%} — The Brahmin was required
not merely to practise individual culture, but also to give
others the advantage of his skill, either as a teacher or as a
sacrificial priest, or as a Purohita.
<div n="P"/>As a teacher the Brahmin has, of course, the special duty of
instructing his own son in both study and sacrificial ritual.<sup>96</sup>
The texts give examples of this, such as Āruṇi and {@Śvetaketu,@}<sup>97</sup>
or mythically Varuṇa and Bhṛgu.<sup>98</sup> This fact also appears
from some of the names in the Vaṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>99</sup> of the
Sāmaveda and the Vaṃśa (list of teachers) of the Śāṅkhāyana
Āraṇyaka.<sup>100</sup> On the other hand, these Vaṃśas and the
Vaṃśas of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa show that a father often
preferred to let his son study under a famous teacher. The
relation of pupil and teacher is described under {@Brahmacarya.@}
A teacher might take several pupils,<sup>101</sup> and he was bound to
teach them with all his heart and soul.<sup>102</sup> He was bound to
reveal everything to his pupil, at any rate to one who was
staying with him for a year ({%saṃvatsara-vāsin%}),<sup>103</sup> an expression
which shows, as was natural, that a pupil might easily
change teachers. But, nevertheless, certain cases of learning
kept secret and only revealed to special persons are enumer-
ated.<sup>104</sup> The exact times and modes of teaching are elaborately
laid down in the Sūtras,<sup>105</sup> but not in the earlier texts.
<div n="P"/>As priest the Brahmin operated in all the greater sacrifices;
the simple domestic ({%gṛhya%}) rites could normally be performed
without his help, but not the more important rites ({%śrauta%}).
[Page2-089+ 66]
The number varied: the ritual literature requires sixteen priests
to be employed at the greatest sacrifices (see {@Ṛtvij@}), but other
rites could be accomplished with four,<sup>106</sup> five,<sup>107</sup> six,<sup>108</sup> seven,<sup>109</sup>
or ten<sup>110</sup> priests. Again, the Kauṣītakins<sup>111</sup> had a seventeenth
priest beside the usual sixteen, the Sadasya, so called because
he watched the performance from the Sadas, ‘seat.’ In one
rite, the Sattra (‘sacrificial session’) of the serpents, the
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>112</sup> adds three more to the sixteen, a
second Unnetṛ, an Abhigara, and an Apagara. The later ritual
places the Brahman at the head of all the priests, but this is
probably not the early view (see {@Brahman@}).
<div n="P"/>The sacrifice ensured, if properly performed, primarily the
advantages of the sacrificer ({%yajamāna%}),<sup>113</sup> but the priest shared
in the profit, besides securing the {@Dakṣiṇās.@} Disputes between
sacrificers and the priests were not rare, as in the case of
{@Viśvantara@} and the {@Śyāparṇas,@}<sup>114</sup> or {@Janamejaya@} and the
{@Asitamṛgas;@}<sup>115</sup> and the {@Aiṣāvīras@} are referred to as undesirable
priests.<sup>116</sup> Moreover, {@Viśvāmitra@} once held the post of Puro-
hita to {@Sudās,@} but gave place to {@Vasiṣṭha.@}
[Page2-090+ 53]
<div n="P"/>The position of {@Purohita@} differed considerably from that of
the ordinary priest, for the Purohita not merely might officiate
at the sacrifice, but was the officiator in all the private sacrifices
of his king. Hence he could, and undoubtedly sometimes did,
obtain great influence over his master in matters of secular
importance; and the power of the priesthood in political as
opposed to domestic and religious matters, no doubt rested on
the Purohita.
<div n="P"/>There is no recognition in Vedic literature of the rule later
prevailing by which, after spending part of his life as a Brahma-
cārin, and part as a householder, the Brahmin became an
ascetic<sup>117</sup> (later divided into the two stages of Vānaprastha,
‘forest-dweller,’ and Saṃnyāsin, ‘mystic’). Yājñavalkya's
case<sup>118</sup> shows that study of the Absolute might empty life of all
its content for the sage, and drive him to abandon wife and
family. In Buddhist times the same phenomenon is seen<sup>119</sup>
applying to other than Brahmins. The Buddhist texts are
here confirmed in some degree by the Greek authorities.<sup>120</sup>
The practice bears a certain resemblance to the habit of kings,
in the Epic tradition,<sup>121</sup> of retiring to the forest when active life
is over.
<div n="P"/>From the Greek authorities<sup>122</sup> it also appears — what is
certainly the case in the Buddhist literature<sup>123</sup> — that Brahmins
practised the most diverse occupations. It is difficult to say
how far this was true for the Vedic period. The analogy of the
Druids<sup>124</sup> — in some respects very close — suggests that the
Brahmins may have been mainly confined to their professional
tasks, including all the learned professions such as astronomy<sup>125</sup>
[Page2-091+ 54]
and so forth. This is not contradicted by any Vedic evidence,
for instance, the poet of a hymn of the Rigveda<sup>126</sup> says he is a
poet, his father a physician ({@Bhiṣaj@}), and his mother a grinder
of corn ({@Upala-prakṣiṇī@}). This would seem to show that a
Brahmin could be a doctor, while his wife would perform the
ordinary household duties. So a Purohita could perhaps take
the field to assist the king by prayer, as Viśvāmitra,<sup>127</sup> and
later on Vasiṣṭha<sup>128</sup> do, but this does not show that priests
normally fought. Nor do they seem normally to have been
agriculturists or merchants. On the other hand, they kept
cattle: a Brahmacārin's duty was to watch his master's
cattle.<sup>129</sup> It is therefore needless to suppose that they could
not, and did not, on occasion turn to agricultural or mercan-
tile pursuits, as they certainly did later. But it must be
remembered that in all probability there was more purity of
blood, and less pressure of life, among the Brahmins of the
Vedic age than later in Buddhist times, when the Vedic
sacrificial apparatus was falling into grave disrepute.
<div n="P"/>It is clear that the Brahmins, whatever their defects, repre-
sented the intellectual side of Vedic life, and that the Kṣatriyas,
if they played a part in that life, did so only in a secondary
degree, and to a minor extent. It is natural to suppose that
the Brahmins also composed ballads, the precursors of the
epic; for though none such have survived, a few stanzas of this
character, celebrating the generosity of patrons, have been
preserved by being embedded in priestly compositions. A
legend in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>130</sup> shows clearly that the
Brahmins regarded civilization as being spread by them only:
[Page2-092+ 48]
{@Kosala@} and {@Videha,@} no doubt settled by Āryan tribes, are only
rendered civilized and habitable by the influence of pious
Brahmins. We need not doubt that the non-Brahminical
tribes (see {@Vrātya@}) had attained intellectual as well as material
civilization, but it is reasonable to assume that their civilization
was inferior to that of the Brahmins, for the history of
Hinduism is the conquest by the Brahmins — not by arms, but
by mind — of the tribes Āryan and non-Āryan originally beyond
the pale.

{@Bharata@}¦ is the name of a people of great importance in the
Rigveda and the later literature. In the Rigveda they appear
prominently in the third and seventh Maṇḍalas in connexion
[Page2-095+ 65]
with {@Sudās@} and the {@Tṛtsus,@}<sup>1</sup> while in the sixth Maṇḍala they
are associated with {@Divodāsa.@}<sup>2</sup> In one passage<sup>3</sup> the Bharatas
are, like the Tṛtsus, enemies of the {@Pūrus:@} there can be little
doubt that Ludwig's view of the identity of the Bharatas and
and Tṛtsus is practically correct. More precisely Oldenberg<sup>5</sup>
considers that the Tṛtsus are the {@Vasiṣṭhas,@} the family singers
of the Bharatas; while Geldner<sup>6</sup> recognizes, with perhaps more
probability, in the Tṛtsus the royal family of the Bharatas.
That the Tṛtsus and Bharatas were enemies, as Zimmer<sup>7</sup>
holds, is most improbable even on geographical grounds, for the
Tṛtsus in Zimmer's view<sup>8</sup> occupied the country to the east of
the {@Paruṣṇī@} (Ravi), and the Bharatas must therefore be
regarded as coming against the Tṛtsus from the west, whereas
the Rigveda<sup>9</sup> recognizes two Bharata chiefs on the {@Sarasvatī,@}
{@Āpayā,@} and {@Dṛṣadvatī@} — that is, in the holy land of India, the
{@Madhyadeśa.@} Hillebrandt<sup>10</sup> sees in the connexion of the
Tṛtsus and the Bharatas a fusion of two tribes; but this is not
supported by any evidence beyond the fact that in his opinion
some such theory is needed to explain Divodāsa's appearing in
connexion with the {@Bharadvāja@} family, while Sudās, his son,
<div n="P"/>^4 Translation of the Rigveda, 3, 172
{%et seq.%}
[Page2-096+ 65]
or perhaps grandson ({%cf.%} {@Pijavana@}), is connected with the
Vasiṣṭhas and the {@Viśvāmitras.@}
<div n="P"/>In the later literature the Bharatas appear as especially
famous. The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>11</sup> mentions Bharata Dauḥ-
ṣanti as a king, sacrificer of the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’)
and {@Śatānīka Sātrājita,@} as another Bharata who offered that
sacrifice. The Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>12</sup> mentions Bharata Dauḥ-
ṣanti as receiving the kingly coronation from {@Dīrghatamas@}
{@Māmateya,@} and Śatānīka as being consecrated by {@Somaśuṣman@}
{@Vājaratnāyana,@} a priest whose name is of quite late origin.
The geographical position of the Bharata people is clearly
shown by the fact that the Bharata kings win victories over the
{@Kāśis,@} and make offerings on the {@Yamunā@} (Jumna) and {@Gaṅgā@}
(Ganges).<sup>13</sup> Moreover, in the formula of the king's proclama-
tion for the people, the variants recorded<sup>14</sup> include {%Kuravaḥ,%}
{%Pañcālāḥ, Kuru-Pañcālāḥ,%} and {%Bharatāḥ;%} and the Mahābhārata
consistently recognizes the royal family of the {@Kurus@} as a
Bharata family.<sup>15</sup> It is therefore extremely probable that
Oldenberg<sup>16</sup> is right in holding that the Bharatas in the times
of the Brāhmaṇas were merging in the Kuru-Pañcāla people.
<div n="P"/>The ritual practices of the Bharatas are repeatedly mentioned
in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>17</sup> the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>18</sup> the
[Page2-097+ 67]
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>19</sup> and the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka.<sup>20</sup> Already
in the Rigveda<sup>21</sup> there is mention made of Agni Bhārata (‘of
the Bharatas’). In the Āprī hymns<sup>22</sup> occurs a goddess
Bhāratī, the personified divine protective power of the
Bharatas: her association in the hymns with Sarasvatī reflects
the connexion of the Bharatas with the Sarasvatī in the
Rigveda.<sup>9</sup> Again, in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>23</sup> Agni is
referred to as {%brāhmaṇa Bhārata,%} ‘priest of the Bharatas,’ and
is invited to dispose of the offering {%Manuṣvat Bharatavat,%} ‘like
Manu,’ ‘like Bharata.’<sup>24</sup>
<div n="P"/>In one or two passages<sup>25</sup> Sudās or Divodāsa and, on the
other hand, Purukutsa or Trasadasyu appear in a friendly
relation. Possibly this points, as Oldenberg<sup>26</sup> suggests, to the
union of Bharatas and Pūrus with the Kurus.
<div n="P"/>A Bharata is referred to in the fifth Maṇḍala of the Rig-
veda:<sup>27</sup> who he was is uncertain.

{@Bharad-vāja@}¦ is the name of the reputed<sup>1</sup> author of the sixth
Maṇḍala of the Rigveda. The attribution is so far correct that
Bharadvāja<sup>2</sup> and the Bharadvājas<sup>3</sup> are repeatedly mentioned as
singers in that Maṇḍala. Judging by the tone of the references
to Bharadvāja, he can hardly be deemed to have been a con-
temporary of any of the hymns.<sup>4</sup> According to the Pañcaviṃśa
[Page2-098+ 52]
Brāhmaṇa,<sup>5</sup> he was the Purohita of {@Divodāsa.@} This interpreta-
tion is to be preferred to that of Roth,<sup>6</sup> who suggests that he
and Divodāsa were identical. His connexion with the house of
Divodāsa also appears from the statement of the Kāṭhaka
Saṃhitā<sup>7</sup> that Bharadvāja gave {@Pratardana@} the kingdom. It
is unnecessary to suppose that the same Bharadvāja was meant
in both cases, and that Pratardana was a son of Divodāsa: the
later Saṃhitās refer to Bharadvāja, like the other great sages,
irrespective of chronology.
<div n="P"/>The Bharadvājas in their poems mention {@Bṛbu, Bṛsaya,@} and
the {@Pārāvatas.@}<sup>8</sup> Hillebrandt<sup>9</sup> has pointed out that they are also
connected with the {@Sṛñjayas.@} In particular, the Śāṅkhāyana
Śrauta Sūtra<sup>10</sup> mentions that Bharadvāja gained largesse from
{@Prastoka Sārñjaya@} and Bṛbu. But it is very doubtful if it is
correct to place all these people and Divodāsa in Arachosia
and Drangiana.

{@Bhiṣaj,@}¦ ‘physician,’ is a word of common occurrence in the
Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later.<sup>2</sup> There is no trace whatever in the former
text of the profession being held in disrepute: the Aśvins,<sup>3</sup>
Varuṇa,<sup>4</sup> and Rudra<sup>5</sup> are all called physicians. On the other
hand, in the Dharma literature<sup>6</sup> this profession is utterly
[Page2-105+ 54]
despised. This dislike is found as early as the Yajurveda
Saṃhitās,<sup>7</sup> where the Aśvins are condemned because of their
having to do with the practice of medicine ({%bheṣaja%}), on the
ground that it brings them too much among men, an allusion
to the caste dislike of promiscuous contact.
<div n="P"/>The Rigveda<sup>8</sup> contains a hymn in which a physician cele-
brates his plants and their healing powers. Moreover, wonder-
ful cures are referred to as performed by the Aśvins: the
healing of the lame<sup>9</sup> and of the blind;<sup>10</sup> the rejuvenation of the
aged {@Cyavana@}<sup>11</sup> and of {@Puraṃdhi's@} husband;<sup>12</sup> the giving of an
iron leg ({%jaṅghā āyasī%}) to {@Viśpalā,@}<sup>13</sup> a deed only more wonderful
if we assume that Viśpalā was a mare, as has been suggested by
Pischel.<sup>14</sup> It would in all probability be a mistake to assume<sup>15</sup>
that the Vedic Indians had any surgical skill: they no doubt
applied simples to wounds,<sup>16</sup> but both their medicine and their
surgery must have been most primitive. All that the Atharva-
veda shows in regard to medicine is the use of herbs combined
with spells,<sup>17</sup> and of water ({%cf.%} {@Jalāṣa@}), remedies Indo-European
in character, but not of much scientific value. On the other
hand, the knowledge of anatomy shown (see {@Śarīra@}), though
betraying grave inaccuracies, is not altogether insignificant;
but that was due no doubt mainly to the practice of dissecting
animals at the sacrifice.
<div n="P"/>There is some evidence in the Rigveda<sup>18</sup> that the practice of
medicine was already a profession; this is supported by the
inclusion of a physician in the list of victims at the Puruṣa-
medha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda.<sup>19</sup> According to
[Page2-106+ 48]
Bloomfield,<sup>20</sup> a hymn of the Atharvaveda<sup>21</sup> contains a physician's
deprecation of the use of home-made remedies instead of
reliance on his professional training.

{@Bhrātṛ@}¦ is the common designation of ‘brother’ from the
Rigveda<sup>1</sup> onwards. The word is also applied to a relation or
close friend generally,<sup>2</sup> but here the persons concerned are, it
should be noted, in the Rigveda<sup>3</sup> deities, who are brothers of
one another or of the worshipper. Thus in the early literature
the word has not really lost its precise sense. The derivation
from the root {%bhṛ,%} ‘support,’ is probably correct, designating
the brother as the support of his sister. This harmonizes with
the fact that in Vedic literature the brother plays the part of
protector of his sister when bereft of her father, and that
maidens deprived of their brothers ({%abhrātṛ%}) meet an evil fate.<sup>4</sup>
The gradation of the relations in the home is shown by the
order in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad,<sup>5</sup> where father, mother,
brother, and sister are successively mentioned. Strife between
brothers is occasionally referred to.<sup>6</sup>

{@Bhrātṛvya@}¦ is found in one passage of the Atharvaveda,<sup>1</sup>
where, being named with brother and sister, it must be an
expression of relationship. The sense appears to be ‘(father's)
brother's son,’ ‘cousin,’<sup>2</sup> this meaning alone accounting for the
sense of ‘rival,’ ‘enemy,’ found elsewhere in the Atharvaveda,<sup>3</sup>
and repeatedly in the other Saṃhitās and the Brāhmaṇas.<sup>4</sup> In
an undivided family the relations of cousins would easily
develop into rivalry and enmity. The original meaning may,
however, have been ‘nephew,’<sup>5</sup> as the simple etymological
sense would be ‘brother's son’; but this seems not to account
for the later meaning so well. The Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>6</sup> pre-
scribes the telling of a falsehood to a Bhrātṛvya, who, further,
is often given the epithets ‘hating’ ({%dviṣan%}) and ‘evil’ ({%apriya,%}

mentions {@Madhyama, Prātībodhī-putra,@} as {%Magadha-vāsin,%}
‘living in Magadha.’ Oldenberg,<sup>8</sup> however, seems clearly right
in regarding this as unusual.
[Page2-117+ 58]
<div n="P"/>The Magadhas are evidently a people in the Baudhāyana and
other Sūtras,<sup>9</sup> possibly also in the Aitareya Āraṇyaka.<sup>10</sup> It is
therefore most improbable that Zimmer<sup>11</sup> can be right in
thinking that in the Yajurveda<sup>3</sup> and the Atharvaveda<sup>4</sup> the
Māgadha is not a man of Magadha, but a member of the mixed
caste produced by a {@Vaiśya@} marrying a {@Kṣatriya@} woman.<sup>12</sup>
But the theory of mixed castes, in any case open to some
doubt, cannot be accepted when used to explain such obviously
tribal names as Māgadha. The fact that the Māgadha is
often in later times a minstrel is easily accounted for by the
assumption that the country was the home of minstrelsy and
that wandering bards from Magadha were apt to visit the more
western lands. This class the later texts recognize as a caste,
inventing an origin by intermarriage of the old-established
castes.
<div n="P"/>The dislike of the Magadhas, which may be Rigvedic, since
the {@Kīkaṭas@} were perhaps the prototype of the Magadhas, was
in all probability due, as Oldenberg<sup>13</sup> thinks, to the fact that
the Magadhas were not really Brahminized. This is entirely in
accord with the evidence of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>14</sup> that
neither {@Kosala@} nor {@Videha@} were fully Brahminized at an early
date, much less Magadha. Weber<sup>15</sup> suggests two other grounds
that may have influenced the position — the persistence of
aboriginal blood and the growth of Buddhism. The latter
consideration is hardly applicable to the Yajurveda or the
Atharvaveda; but the imperfect Brahminization of the land, if
substituted for it in accordance with Oldenberg's suggestion,
[Page2-118+ 51]
would have some force. The former motive, despite Olden-
berg's doubt, seems fully justified. Pargiter<sup>16</sup> has gone so
far as to suggest that in Magadha the Āryans met and mingled
with a body of invaders from the east by sea. Though there
is no evidence for this view in the Vedic texts, it is reason-
able to suppose that the farther east the Āryans penetrated,
the less did they impress themselves upon the aborigines.
Modern ethnology confirms this {%a priori%} supposition in so far as
it shows Āryan types growing less and less marked as the
eastern part of India is reached, although such evidence is not
decisive in view of the great intermixture of peoples in India.

{@Viśvāmitras.@}<sup>7</sup> The view, however, which interprets the hymn

from its connexion with water, was considered to have cooling
properties. Thus after the burning of the dead body the frog
is invited to come to the spot where the cremation has taken
place in order to cool it down.<sup>9</sup> Similarly the frog is invoked

{@Śūrasenakas,@} and Brahmāvarta<sup>3</sup> as meaning the particularly
holy land between the Sarasvatī and the {@Dṛṣadvatī.@} The

of Vinaśana; west of the Kālaka-vana, ‘Black Forest,’ or rather
Kanakhala, near Hardvār; south of the Himālaya; and north
of the Pāriyātra or the Pāripātra Mountains; adding that, in
the opinion of others,<sup>5</sup> it was confined to the country between
the Yamunā and the Gaṅgā, while the {@Bhāllavins@}<sup>6</sup> took it as
the country between the boundary-river (or perhaps the Saras-
[Page2-126+ 84]
vatī)<sup>7</sup> and the region where the sun rises. The Mānava
Dharma Śāstra,<sup>8</sup> in accord with the Vasiṣṭha Dharma Sūtra,<sup>9</sup>

said, that the ‘Vedic hymns contain
no reference to the route by which the
Āryans entered India or to their earlier
settlements on the Indus,’ and that this
is explained by the theory of the entry
of the Vedic Indians viâ Chitral, is to
assert absurdities. The theory is based
on the later dialects and their affinities

{@Māṃsa,@}¦ ‘flesh.’ The eating of flesh appears as something
quite regular in the Vedic texts, which show no trace of the
doctrine of Ahiṃsā, or abstaining from injury to animals. For
example, the ritual offerings of flesh contemplate that the gods
will eat it, and again the Brahmins ate the offerings.<sup>1</sup> Again,
the slaying of a ‘great ox’ ({%mahokṣa%}) or a ‘great goat’ ({%mahāja%})
for a guest was regularly prescribed;<sup>2</sup> and the name {@Atithigva@}
probably means ‘slaying cows for guests.’<sup>3</sup> The great sage
{@Yājñavalkya@} was wont to eat the meat of milch cows and
bullocks ({%dhenv-anaḍuha%}) if only it was {%aṃsala%} (‘firm’ or
‘tender’).<sup>4</sup> The slaughter of a hundred bulls ({%ukṣan%}) was
credited to one sacrificer, {@Agastya.@}<sup>5</sup> The marriage ceremony
was accompanied by the slaying of oxen, clearly for food.<sup>6</sup>
[Page2-146+ 62]
<div n="P"/>That there was any general objection to the eating of flesh
is most improbable. Sometimes it is forbidden, as when a
man is performing a vow,<sup>7</sup> or its use is disapproved, as in
a passage of the Atharvaveda,<sup>8</sup> where meat is classed with
{@Surā,@} or intoxicating liquor, as a bad thing. Again, in the
Rigveda<sup>9</sup> the slaying of the cows is said to take place in the
{@Aghās,@} a deliberate variation for {@Maghās;@} but this may be
the outcome merely of a natural association of death with
gloom, even when cows alone are the victims in question.
The Brāhmaṇas also contain the doctrine of the eater in this
world being eaten in the next,<sup>10</sup> but this is not to be regarded
as a moral or religious disapproval of eating flesh, though it
no doubt contains the germ of such a view, which is also in
harmony with the persuasion of the unity of existence, which
becomes marked in the Brāhmaṇas. But Ahiṃsā as a deve-
loped and articulate doctrine would seem to have arisen from
the acceptance of the doctrine of transmigration, which in its
fundamentals is later than the Brāhmaṇa period.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="P"/>On the other hand, it is to be noted that the cow was on the
road to acquire special sanctity in the Rigveda,<sup>12</sup> as is shown
by the name {%aghnyā,%}<sup>13</sup> ‘not to be slain,’ applied to it in several
passages. But this fact cannot be regarded as showing that
[Page2-147+ 50]
meat eating generally was condemned. Apart from mythical
considerations, such as the identification of the cow with earth
or Aditi (which are, of course, much more than an effort of
priestly ingenuity), the value of the cow for other purposes
than eating was so great as to account adequately for its
sanctity, the beginnings of which can in fact be traced back to
Indo-Iranian times.<sup>14</sup> Moreover, the ritual of the cremation
of the dead required the slaughter of a cow as an essential
part, the flesh being used to envelope the dead body.<sup>15</sup>
<div n="P"/>The usual food of the Vedic Indian, as far as flesh was
concerned, can be gathered from the list of sacrificial victims:
what man ate he presented to the gods — that is, the sheep, the
goat, and the ox. The horse sacrifice was an infrequent
exception: it is probably not to be regarded as a trace of the
use of horseflesh as food, though the possibility of such being
the case cannot be overlooked in view of the widespread use
of horseflesh as food in different countries and times. It is,
however, more likely that the aim of this sacrifice was to
impart magic strength, the speed and vigour of the horse, to
the god and his worshippers, as Oldenberg<sup>16</sup> argues.

<L>2476<pc>2-156<k1>mAsa<k2>mAsa
{@Māsa@}¦ denotes a ‘month,’ a period of time repeatedly men-
tioned in the Rigveda and later.
<div n="P"/>The characteristic days (or rather nights) of the month were
those of the new moon, Amā-vasyā, ‘home-staying (night),’ and
‘of the full moon,’ Paurṇa-māsī. Two hymns of the Atharva-
veda<sup>1</sup> celebrate these days respectively. A personification of
the phases of the moon is seen in the four names Sinīvālī,<sup>2</sup>
[Page2-157+ 72]
the day before new moon; Kuhū,<sup>3</sup> also called Guṅgū,<sup>4</sup> the
new moon day; Anumati,<sup>5</sup> the day before full moon; and
Rākā,<sup>6</sup> the day of new moon. The importance of the new and
full moon days is seen in the Darśa-pūrṇamāsau, or festivals
of the new and full moon days respectively.
<div n="P"/>One special day in the month, the {@Ekāṣṭakā,@} or eighth day
after full moon, was important. In the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>7</sup>
there are stated to be in the year twelve such, mentioned
between the twelve days of full moon and the twelve days of
new moon. But one Ekāṣṭakā is referred to in the Yajurveda
Saṃhitās and elsewhere<sup>8</sup> as of quite special importance. This
was, in the accordant opinion of most commentators, the
eighth day after the full moon of {@Māgha.@} It marked the end
of the year, or the beginning of the new year. Though the
Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa<sup>9</sup> places the winter solstice in the new
moon of Māgha, the latter date probably means the new moon
preceding full moon in Māgha,<sup>10</sup> not the new moon following
[Page2-158+ 74]
full moon; but it is perhaps possible to account adequately for
the importance of the Ekāṣṭakā as being the first Aṣṭakā
after the beginning of the new year.
<div n="P"/>It is not certain exactly how the month was reckoned, whether
from the day after new moon to new moon — the system known
as {%amānta,%} or from the day after full moon to full moon — the {%pūr-%}
{%ṇimānta%} system, which later, at any rate, was followed in North
India, while the other system prevailed in the south. Jacobi<sup>11</sup>
argues that the year began in the full moon of Phālguna, and
that only by the full moon's conjunction with the Nakṣatra could
the month be known. Oldenberg<sup>12</sup> points to the fact that the
new moon is far more distinctively an epoch than the full
moon; that the Greek, Roman, and Jewish years began with
the new moon; and that the Vedic evidence is the division of
the month into the former ({%pūrva%}) and latter ({%apara%}) halves,
the first being the bright ({%śukla%}), the second the dark ({%kṛṣṇa%})
period. Thibaut<sup>13</sup> considers that to assume the existence of
the {%pūrṇimānta%} system for the Veda is unnecessary, though
possible. Weber<sup>10</sup> assumes that it occurs in the Kauṣītaki
Brāhmaṇa as held by the scholiasts. But it would probably
be a mistake to press that passage, or to assume that the
{%amānta%} system was rigidly accepted in the Veda: it seems at
least as probable that the month was vaguely regarded as
beginning with the new moon day, so that new moon preceded
full moon, which was in the middle, not the end or the
beginning of the month.
<div n="P"/>That a month regularly had 30 days is established by the
conclusive evidence of numerous passages in which the year is
given 12 months and 360 days. This month is known from the
earliest records, being both referred to directly and alluded to.<sup>14</sup>
[Page2-159+ 55]
It is the regular month of the Brāhmaṇas,<sup>15</sup> and must be
regarded as the month which the Vedic Indian recognized.
No other month is mentioned as such in the Brāhmaṇa
literature; it is only in the Sūtras that months of different
length occur. The Sāmaveda Sūtras<sup>16</sup> refer to (1) years with
324 days — {%i.e.,%} periodic years with 12 months of 27 days each;
(2) years with 351 days — {%i.e.,%} periodic years with 12 months of
27 days each, plus another month of 27 days; (3) years with
354 days — {%i.e.,%} 6 months of 30 days, and 6 with 29 days, in
other words, lunar synodic years; (4) years with 360 days, or
ordinary civil ({%sāvana%}) years; (5) years with 378 days, which,
as Thibaut<sup>17</sup> clearly shows, are third years, in which, after
two years of 360 days each, 18 days were added to bring about
correspondence between the civil year and the solar year of
366 days. But even the Sāmasūtras do not mention the year
of 366 days, which is first known to the Jyotiṣa<sup>18</sup> and to
Garga.<sup>19</sup>
<div n="P"/>That the Vedic period was acquainted with the year of
354 days cannot be affirmed with certainty. Zimmer,<sup>20</sup> indeed,
thinks that it is proved by the fact that pregnancy is estimated
at ten months, or sometimes a year.<sup>21</sup> But Weber<sup>22</sup> may be
right in holding that the month is the periodic month of
27 days, for the period is otherwise too long if a year is taken.
On the other hand, the period of ten months quite well suits
the period of gestation, if birth takes place in the tenth month,
so that in this sense the month of 30 days may well be meant.
[Page2-160+ 57]
<div n="P"/>The year of 12 months of 30 days each being admittedly
quite unscientific, Zimmer<sup>23</sup> is strongly of opinion that it was
only used with a recognition of the fact that intercalation took
place, and that the year formed part of a greater complex,
normally the five your Yuga or cycle. This system is well
known from the Jyotṣa: it consists of 62 months of 29(16/31) days
each = 1, 830 days (two of these months being intercalary, one
in the middle and one at the end), or 61 months of 30 days,
or 60 months of 30(1/2) days, the unit being clearly a solar year
of 366 days. It is not an ideal system, since the year is too
long;<sup>24</sup> but it is one which cannot be claimed even for the
Brāhmaṇa period, during which no decision as to the true
length of the year seems to have been arrived at. The
references to it seen by Zimmer in the Rigveda<sup>25</sup> are not even
reasonably plausible, while the {%pañcaka yuga,%} cited by him from
the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>26</sup> occurs only in a quotation in
a commentary, and had no authority for the text itself.
<div n="P"/>On the other hand, there was undoubtedly some attempt to
bring the year of 360 days — a synodic lunar year — roughly
into connexion with reality. A Sāmasūtra<sup>27</sup> treats it as a
solar year, stating that he sun perambulates each Naxatra in
13(1/3) days, while others again evidently interpolated 18 days
every third year, in order to arrive at some equality. But
Vedic literature, from the Rigveda<sup>28</sup> downwards,<sup>29</sup> teems with
the assertion of the difficulty of ascertaining the month.
The length is variously given as 30 days,<sup>30</sup> 35 days,<sup>31</sup> or
[Page2-161+ 63]
36 days.<sup>32</sup> The last number possibly indicates an intercalation
after six years (6×6 = 36, or for ritual purposes 35), but for
this we have no special evidence. There are many references<sup>33</sup>
to the year having 12 or 13 months.
<div n="P"/>The names of the months are, curiously enough, not at all
ancient. The sacrificial texts of the Yajurveda give them in
their clearest form where the Agnicayana, ‘building of the
fire-altar,’ is described.<sup>34</sup> These names are the following:
(1) Madhu, (2) Mādhava (spring months, {%vāsantikāv ṛtū%});
(3) Śukra, (4) Śuci (summer months, {%graiṣmāv ṛtū%}); (5) Nabha
(or Nabhas),<sup>35</sup> (6) Nabhasya (rainy months, {%vārṣikāv ṛtū%});
(7) Iṣa, (8) Ūrja (autumn months, {%śāradāv ṛtū%}); (9) Saha (or
Sahas),<sup>35</sup> (10) Sahasya (winter months, {%haimantikāv ṛtū%});
(11) Tapa (or Tapas),<sup>35</sup> (12) Tapasya (cool months, {%śaiśirāv%}
{%ṛtū%}).
<div n="P"/>There are similar lists in the descriptions of the Soma
sacrifice<sup>36</sup> and of the horse sacrifice,<sup>37</sup> all of them agreeing in
essentials. There are other lists of still more fanciful names,<sup>38</sup>
but these have no claim at all to represent actual divisions in
popular use. It is doubtful if the list given above is more than
a matter of priestly invention. Weber points out that Madhu
and Mādhava later appear as names of spring, and that these
two are mentioned in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka<sup>39</sup> as if actually
[Page2-162+ 59]
employed; but the evidence is very inadequate to show that
the other names of the months given in the list were in ordinary
use.<sup>40</sup>
<div n="P"/>In some of these lists the intercalary month is mentioned.
The name given to it in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>41</sup> is Aṃhasas-
pati, while that given in the Taittirīya<sup>42</sup> and Maitrāyaṇī
Saṃhitās<sup>43</sup> is Saṃsarpa. The Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>44</sup> gives it the
name of Malimluca, which also occurs elsewhere, along with
Saṃsarpa, in one of the lists of fanciful names.<sup>45</sup> The
Atharvaveda<sup>46</sup> describes it as {%sanisrasa,%} ‘slipping,’ owing no
doubt to its unstable condition.
<div n="P"/>The other method of naming the months is from the
{@Nakṣatras.@} It is only beginning to be used in the Brāhmaṇas,
but is found regularly in the Epic and later. The Jyotiṣa<sup>47</sup>
mentions that Māgha and Tapa were identical: this is the fair
interpretation of the passage, which also involves the identifica-
tion of Madhu with Caitra, a result corresponding with the
view frequently found in the Brāhmaṇas, that the full moon in
Citrā, and not that in Phalgunī, is the beginning of the year.<sup>48</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>49</sup> are found two curious ex-
pressions, {%yava%} and {%ayava,%} for the light and dark halves of the
month, which is clearly considered to begin with the light half.
Possibly the words are derived, as Eggling<sup>50</sup> thinks, from {%yu,%}
‘ward off,’ with reference to evil spirits. The word {@Parvan@}
[Page2-163+ 54]
(‘joint’ = division of time) probably<sup>51</sup> denotes a half of the
month, perhaps already in the Rigveda.<sup>52</sup> More precisely the
first half, the time of the waxing light, is called {%pūrva-pakṣa,%}<sup>53</sup>
the second, that of the waning light, {%apara-pakṣa,%}<sup>54</sup> Either of
these might be called a half-month ({%ardha-māsa%}).<sup>55</sup>

or Caitra could be regarded as the
beginning of spring without much im-

{@Mudgala@}¦ and {@Mudgalanī,@} ‘Mudgala's wife,’ both figure in
a hopelessly obscure hymn of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> variously inter-
preted by Pischel<sup>2</sup> and Geldner<sup>3</sup> and von Bradke<sup>4</sup> as telling
of a real chariot race in which, despite difficulties, Mudgala
won by his wife's aid. The Indian tradition is as variant as
the interpretations of modern authorities. Ṣaḍguruśiṣya<sup>5</sup>
explains that Mudgala's oxen were stolen, that he pursued the
thieves with the one old ox he had left, and that hurling his
hammer ({%dru-ghaṇa%}) he caught the marauders. Yāska,<sup>6</sup> on the
other hand, says that Mudgala won a race with a {%drughaṇa%}
and an ox instead of with two oxen. It is pretty clear that,
as Roth<sup>7</sup> observed, the tradition is merely a guess, and a bad
one, at the meaning of an obscure hymn, and this view is
[Page2-167+ 55]
accepted by Oldenberg.<sup>8</sup> Bloomfield<sup>9</sup> has interpreted the
legend as one of heavenly, not of human, events. Mudgala,
probably a variant form of Mudgara,<sup>10</sup> which in the later
language means a hammer or a similar weapon, may be meant
as a personification of the thunderbolt of Indra, rather than
a real man.<sup>11</sup> Later<sup>12</sup> Mudgala is a mythical sage.

<L>2496<pc>2-167<k1>muni<k2>muni
{@Muni@}¦ occurs in one hymn of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> where it seems to
denote an ascetic of magic powers with divine afflatus ({%deveṣita%}),
the precursor of the strange ascetics of later India. This
agrees with the fact that {@Aitaśa,@} the Muni, is in the Aitareya
Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> regarded by his son as deranged, a view not
unjustified if the nonsense which passes as the Aitaśapralāpa.<sup>3</sup>
‘Chatter of Aitaśa,’ was really his. The Rigveda<sup>4</sup> calls Indra
the ‘friend of Munis,’ and the Atharvaveda<sup>5</sup> refers to a ‘divine
Muni’ ({%deva muni%}), by whom a similar ascetic may be meant.
<div n="P"/>In the Upaniṣads<sup>6</sup> the Muni is of a more restrained type:
he is one who learns the nature of the Brahman, the Absolute,
by study, or sacrifice, or penance, or fasting, or faith ({%śraddhā%}).
It must not of course be thought that there is any absolute
distinction between the older Muni and the later: in both
cases the man is in a peculiar ecstatic condition, but the ideal
of the Upaniṣads is less material than the earlier picture of the
Muni, who is more of a ‘medicine man’ than a sage. Nor
would it be wise to conclude from the comparative rareness
[Page2-168+ 39]
of the mention of the Muni in the Vedic texts that he was
an infrequent figure in Vedic times: he was probably not
approved by the priests who followed the ritual, and whose
views were essentially different from the ideals of a Muni,
which were superior to earthly considerations, such as the
desire for children and {@Dakṣiṇās.@}<sup>7</sup>

The Indian commentators<sup>5</sup> agree with Yāska in taking Mūja-
vant as the name of a mountain, and though Hillebrandt<sup>6</sup> is

Zimmer<sup>7</sup> with one of the lower hills on the south-west of
Kaśmīr lacks evidence, it is not reasonable to deny that
Mūjavant was a hill from which the people took their name.
Yāska<sup>8</sup> suggests that Mūjavant is equivalent to Muñjavant,
which actually occurs later, in the Epic,<sup>9</sup> as the name of a
mountain in the Himālaya.

3. {@Mṛga Hastin,@}¦ the ‘animal with a hand,’ is mentioned in
two passages of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> in which Roth<sup>2</sup> recognizes that
the elephant is meant, but concludes that the compound name
[Page2-172+ 54]
is a proof of the newness of the elephant to the Vedic Indians.<sup>3</sup>
Later the adjective Hastin alone became the regular name of
the animal (like {@Mahiṣa@} of the ‘buffalo’). The elephant is
also denoted in the Rigveda by the descriptive term Mṛga
Vāraṇa,<sup>4</sup> the ‘wild or dangerous animal,’ the adjective {%vāraṇa%}
similarly becoming one of the names for ‘elephant’ in the later
language. Pischel's view<sup>5</sup> that the catching of elephants by
the use of tame female elephants is already alluded to in the
Rigveda<sup>6</sup> seems very doubtful. In the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>7</sup>
elephants are described as ‘black, white-toothed, adorned with
gold.’

{@Mṛgayu,@}¦ ‘hunter,’ occurs in the later Saṃhitās<sup>1</sup> and the
Brāhmaṇas,<sup>2</sup> but not very often. The Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>3</sup>
and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>4</sup> however, in the list of victims
at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) include a number of
names which seem to be those of persons who make a liveli-
hood by fishing or by hunting, such as the {@Mārgāra,@} ‘hunter,’
[Page2-173+ 47]
the {@Kaivarta@} or {@Kevarta, Pauñjiṣṭha, Daśa, Maināla,@} ‘fisher
man,’ and perhaps the {@Bainda@} and the Ānda,<sup>5</sup> who seem to
have been some sort of fishermen.
<div n="P"/>It is not probable that even in the earliest Vedic period
hunting formed the main source of livelihood for any of the
Vedic tribes: pastoral pursuits and agriculture ({@Kṛṣi@}) were, no
doubt, the mainstay of their existence. But it would be
unreasonable to suppose that not much hunting was done,
both for recreation and for purposes of food, as well as for
protection of flocks from wild beasts. The Rigveda is naturally
our chief source of information in regard to hunting. The
arrow was sometimes employed,<sup>6</sup> but, as is usual with primitive
man, the normal instruments of capture were nets and pitfalls.
Birds were regularly caught in nets ({@Pāśa,@}<sup>7</sup> {@Nidhā,@}<sup>8</sup> {@Jāla@}),<sup>9</sup> The
bird-catcher being called {%nidhā-pati,%}<sup>10</sup> ‘master of snares.’ The
net was fastened on pegs<sup>11</sup> (as is done with modern nets for
catching birds). Another name of net is apparently {@Mukṣījā.@}
<div n="P"/>Pits were used for catching antelopes ({@Ṛśya@}), and so were
called {%ṛśya-da,%}<sup>12</sup> ‘antelope-catching.’ Elephants were captured
as in Greek times, perhaps through the instrumentality of tame
females (see {@Mṛga Hastin@}). Apparently the boar was captured
in the chase, dogs being used,<sup>13</sup> but the passage from which
this view is deduced is of uncertain mythological content.
There is also an obscure reference<sup>14</sup> to the capture of the
buffalo ({@Gaura@}), but it is not clear whether the reference is to
shooting with an arrow or capturing by means of ropes,
perhaps a lasso, or a net. The lion was captured in pitfalls,<sup>15</sup>
or was surrounded by the hunters and slain;<sup>16</sup> one very obscure
passage refers to the lion being caught by ambuscade, which
perhaps merely alludes to the use of the hidden pit.<sup>17</sup>
<div n="P"/>The modes of catching fish are little known, for the only
evidence available are the explanations of the various names
[Page2-174+ 45]
mentioned in the Yajurveda. Sāyaṇa<sup>18</sup> says that {@Dhaivara@} is
one who takes fish by netting a tank on either side; Dāśa and
{@Śauṣkala@} do so by means of a fish-hook ({%baḍiśa%}); Bainda,
Kaivarta, and Maināla by means of a net ({%jāla%}); Mārgāra
catches fish in the water with his hands; Ānda by putting in
pegs at a ford (apparently by building a sort of dam); {@Parṇaka@}
by putting a poisoned leaf on the water. But none of these
explanations can claim much authority.

Prajāpati (Orion) pursues his daughter (Rohiṇī), and is shot
by the archer Sirius. The transference of the legend of
Prajāpati to the sky is no doubt secondary, caused by the
obvious similarity of the constellation in question to the idea
of an archer.

{@Mṛtyu,@}¦ ‘death,’ is repeatedly mentioned in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup>
and later<sup>2</sup> as a thing of terror. There are a hundred and one
forms of death, the natural one by old age<sup>3</sup> ({%jarā%}), and a
hundred others, all to be avoided.<sup>4</sup> To die before old age
({%purā jarasaḥ%})<sup>5</sup> is to die before the allotted span ({%purā āyuṣaḥ%}),<sup>6</sup>
the normal length of life being throughout Vedic literature
spoken of as a hundred years.<sup>7</sup> On the other hand, the evils
of old age in the loss of physical strength were clearly realized.<sup>8</sup>
one of the feats of the Aśvins was to restore old {@Cyavāna@} to
his former youth and powers, and another was the rejuvenation
of {@Kali.@}<sup>9</sup> The Atharvaveda<sup>10</sup> is full of charms of all sorts to
avert death and secure length of years ({%āyuṣya%}).
<div n="P"/>The modes of disposing of the dead were burial and cremation
(see {@Agnidagdha@}). Both existed in the early Vedic period,<sup>11</sup>
as in Greece;<sup>12</sup> but the former method was on the whole less
favoured, and tended to be regarded with disapproval. The
bones of the dead, whether burned or not, were marked by the
erection of a tumulus ({@Śmaśāna@}): the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>13</sup>
preserves traces of strong differences of opinion as to the mode
in which these tumuli should be constructed. There is little
or no trace<sup>14</sup> of the custom common in northern lands of
sending the dead man to sea in a burning ship: the reference
[Page2-176+ 60]
to a ship<sup>15</sup> seems to point to mythical perils after death, not to
the mode of burial.
<div n="P"/>The life after death was to the Vedic Indian a repetition of
the life in this world. He passed into the next world {%sarva-%}
{%tanuḥ sāṅgaḥ,%} ‘with whole body and all his members,’<sup>16</sup> enjoying
there the same pleasures as he had enjoyed on earth. Even
in the Rigveda<sup>17</sup> there are hints of evil awaiting evil-doers, but
it is not until the Atharvaveda<sup>18</sup> and the Brāhmaṇas<sup>19</sup> that
a hell of punishment is set out, and it is in the Brāhmaṇas<sup>20</sup>
that good and evil deeds are said to produce happiness or hell
hereafter. But there is no hint of extinction<sup>21</sup> in the Rigveda
as the fate of the wicked, as Roth<sup>22</sup> inclined to think. The
Vedic poet not being deeply moral, his verses do not convey,
as would those of a man convinced of sin, warnings of future
judgment.

2. {@Yuga@}¦ in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> frequently denotes a ‘generation’;
but the expression {%daśame yuge%} applied to {@Dīrghatamas@} in one

<div n="P"/>There is no reference in the older Vedic texts to the five-year
cycle (see {@Saṃvatsara@}). The quotation from the Pañcaviṃśa
Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup> given in the St. Petersburg Dictionary, and by
Zimmer<sup>4</sup> and others, is merely a citation from a modern text
in the commentary on that work.
<div n="P"/>Nor do the older Vedic texts know of any series of Yugas or
ages such as are usual later. In the Atharvaveda<sup>5</sup> there are
mentioned in order a hundred years, an {%ayuta%} (10,000?), and
then two, three, or four Yugas: the inference from this seems
to be that a Yuga means more than an {%ayuta,%} but is not very
[Page2-193+ 67]
certain. Zimmer<sup>6</sup> adduces a passage from the Rigveda,<sup>7</sup>
but the reference there, whatever it may be,<sup>8</sup> is certainly
not to the four ages ({%cf.%} also {@Triyuga@}).<sup>9</sup> The Taittirīya
Brāhmaṇa<sup>10</sup> recognizes long periods of time — {%e.g.,%} one of
100,000 years.
<div n="P"/>To the four ages, Kali, Dvāpara, Tretā, and Kṛta, there is no
certain reference in Vedic literature, though the names occur as
the designations of throws at dice (see {@Akṣa@}). In the Aitareya
Brāhmaṇa<sup>11</sup> the names occur, but it is not clear that the ages
are really meant. Haug<sup>12</sup> thought that the dice were meant:
this view is at least as probable as the alternative explanation,
which is accepted by Weber,<sup>13</sup> Roth,<sup>14</sup> Wilson,<sup>15</sup> Max Müller,<sup>16</sup>
and Muir.<sup>17</sup> Roth, indeed, believes that the verse is an inter-
polation; but in any case it must be remembered that the
passage is from a late book of the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa. Four
ages — Puṣya, Dvāpara, Khārvā, and Kṛta — are mentioned in
the late Ṣaḍviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>18</sup> and the Dvāpara in the Gopatha
Brāhmaṇa.<sup>19</sup>

‘royal consecration.’ The list given in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>1</sup>
and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup> consists of the Brahman ({%i.e.,%}
the Purohita), the Rājanya, the Mahiṣī (the first wife of the
king), the {@Vāvāta@} (the favourite wife of the king), the Parivṛktī
(the discarded wife), the Senānī, ‘commander of the army’; the
Sūta, ‘charioteer’; the Grāmaṇī, ‘village headman’; the
Kṣattṛ, ‘chamberlain’; the Saṃgrahītṛ, ‘charioteer’ or
‘treasurer’; the Bhāgadugha, ‘collector of taxes’ or ‘divider
of food’; and the Akṣāvāpa, ‘superintender of dicing’ or
‘thrower of dice.’ In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup> the order is
Senānī; Purohita; Mahisī; Sūta; Grāmaṇī; Kṣattṛ; Saṃ-
grahitṛ; Bhāgadugha; Akṣāvāpa; Go-nikartana, ‘slayer of
cows’ or ‘huntsman’; and Pālāgala, ‘courier’; the ‘discarded
wife’ being mentioned as forbidden to stay at home<sup>4</sup> on the
day of the ceremony of offering a pap for Nirṛti in her house.
In the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā<sup>5</sup> the list is Brahman ({%i.e.,%} Puro-
hita); Rājan; Mahiṣī; Parivṛktī; Senānī; Saṃgrahītṛ; Kṣattṛ;
Sūta; Vaiśyagrāmaṇī; Bhāgadugha; Takṣa-Rathakārau, ‘car-
penter and chariot-maker’; Akṣāvāpa; and Go-vikarta. The
Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>6</sup> substitutes Go-vyacha for Govikarta, and
omits Takṣa-Rathakārau.

household, and of the king's servants in the administration of

revenue, as was regularly done later on.

{@Ratha@}¦ in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later<sup>2</sup> denotes ‘chariot’ as
opposed to {@Anas,@} ‘cart,’ though the distinction is not absolute.
Of differences in the structure of the two we have no informa-
tion, except that the {@Kha,@} or nave hole, in the wheel of the
chariot was greater than in that of the cart.<sup>3</sup>
<div n="P"/>The chariot has, as a rule, two wheels ({@Cakra@}), to which
reference is frequently made.<sup>4</sup> The wheel consisted of a rim
({@Pavi@}), a felly ({@Pradhi@}), spokes ({@Ara@}),<sup>5</sup> and a nave ({@Nabhya@}).
The rim and the felly together constitute the {@Nemi.@} The hole
in the nave is called {@Kha:@} into it the end of the axle was
inserted; but there is some uncertainty whether {@Āṇi@} denotes
the extremity of the axle that was inserted in the nave, or the
lynch-pin used to keep that extremity in the wheel. Sometimes
a solid wheel was used.<sup>6</sup>
<div n="P"/>The axle ({@Akṣa@}) was, in some cases, made of {@Araṭu@} wood;<sup>7</sup>
round its ends the wheels revolved. To the axle was attached
the body of the chariot ({@Kośa@}). This part is also denoted by
the word {@Vandhura,@} which more precisely means the ‘seat’
of the chariot. The epithet {%tri-vandhura%} is used of the chariot
of the Aśvins, seemingly to correspond with another of its
epithets, {%tri-cakra:%} perhaps, as Weber<sup>8</sup> thinks, a chariot with
three seats and three wheels was a real form of vehicle; but
Zimmer<sup>9</sup> considers that the vehicle was purely mythical. {@Garta@}
also denotes the seat of the warrior.
[Page2-202+ 61]
<div n="P"/>At right angles to the axle was the pole of the chariot ({@Īṣā,@}
{@Praüga@}). Normally there was, it seems, one pole, on either
side of which the horses were harnessed, a yoke ({@Yuga@}) being
laid across their necks; the pole was passed through the hole
in the yoke (called Kha<sup>10</sup> or Tardman),<sup>11</sup> the yoke and the pole
then being tied together.<sup>12</sup>
<div n="P"/>The horses were tied by the neck ({%grīvā%}), where the yoke was
placed, and also at the shoulder, presumably by traces fastened
to a bar of wood at right angles to the pole, or fastened to the
ends of the pole, if that is to be regarded, as it probably
should, as of triangular shape, wide at the foot and coming to
a point at the tip.<sup>13</sup> The traces seem to be denoted by {@Raśmi@}
and {@Raśanā.@} These words also denote the ‘reins,’ which were
fastened to the bit (perhaps {%śiprā%}) in the horse's mouth. The
driver controlled the horses by reins, and urged them on with
a whip ({%Kaśā%}).<sup>14</sup> The girths of the horse were called Kakṣyā.<sup>15</sup>
<div n="P"/>The normal number of horses seems to have been two, but
three or four<sup>16</sup> were often used. It is uncertain whether, in
these cases, the extra horse was attached in front or at the
side; possibly both modes were in use. Even five steeds could
be employed.<sup>17</sup> Horses were normally used for chariots, but
the ass ({%gardabha%})<sup>18</sup> or mule ({%aśvatarī%})<sup>19</sup> are also mentioned.
The ox was employed for drawing carts, and in fact derived its
[Page2-203+ 57]
name, {@Anaḍvāh,@} from this use. Sometimes a poor man had to
be content with a single steed, which then ran between two
shafts.<sup>20</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the chariot the driver stood on the right, while the
warrior was on the left, as indicated by his name, {@Savyeṣṭha@} or
{@Savyaṣṭhā,@}<sup>21</sup> He could also sit when he wanted, for the
chariot had seats, and an archer would naturally prefer to sit
while shooting his arrows.
<div n="P"/>The dimensions of the chariot are given in the Śulba Sūtra<sup>22</sup>
of Āpastamba at 188 Aṅgulis (finger-breadths) for the pole,
104 for the axle, and 86 for the yoke. The material used in
its construction was wood, except for the rim of the wheel.<sup>23</sup>
<div n="P"/>Many other parts of the chariot are mentioned, their names
being often obscure in meaning: see {@Aṅka, Nyaṅka, Uddhi,@}

{@Ratha-kāra,@}¦ ‘chariot-maker,’ is mentioned in the Atharva-
veda<sup>1</sup> as one of those who are to be subject to the king, seeming
to stand generally as an example of the industrial population.
He is also referred to in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās<sup>2</sup> and in the
Brāhmaṇas:<sup>3</sup> in all these passages, as well a probably in the
Atharvaveda also, the Rathakāra already forms a caste. The
[Page2-204+ 45]
later system<sup>4</sup> regards the Rathakāra as the offspring of a
Māhiṣya (the son of a Kṣatriya husband and a Vaiśya wife) and
a Karaṇī (the daughter of a Vaiśya husband and a Śūdra wife),
but it is unreasonable to suppose that such an origin is
historically accurate. The Rathakāras must rather be deemed
to have been a functional caste. Hillebrandt<sup>5</sup> suggests that
the {@Anu@} tribe formed the basis of the Rathakāra caste, referring
to their worship of the Ṛbhus, who are, of course, the chariot-
makers {%par excellence.%} But there is little ground for this view.

1. {@Rājan,@}¦ ‘king,’ is a term repeatedly occurring in the Rig-
veda<sup>1</sup> and the later literature.<sup>2</sup> It is quite clear that the
normal, though not universal form of government, in early
India was that by kings, as might be expected in view of the
fact that the Āryan Indians were invaders in a hostile territory:
a situation which, as in the case of the Āryan invaders of
Greece and of the German invaders of England, resulted almost
necessarily in strengthening the monarchic element of the
constitution.<sup>3</sup> The mere patriarchal organization of society
is not sufficient, as Zimmer<sup>4</sup> assumes, to explain the Vedic
kingship.
[Page2-211+ 53]
<div n="P"/>{%Tenure of Monarchy.%} — Zimmer<sup>5</sup> is of opinion that while the
Vedic monarchy was sometimes hereditary, as is indeed shown
by several cases where the descent can be traced,<sup>6</sup> yet in others
the monarchy was elective, though it is not clear whether the
selection by the people was between the members of the royal
family only or extended to members of all the noble clans. It
must, however, be admitted that the evidence for the elective
monarchy is not strong. As Geldner<sup>7</sup> argues, all the passages
cited<sup>8</sup> can be regarded not as choice by the cantons ({@Viś@}), but
as acceptance by the subjects ({%viś%}): this seems the more prob-
able sense. Of course this is no proof that the monarchy was
not sometimes elective: the practice of selecting one member
of the family to the exclusion of another less well qualified is
exemplified by the legend in Yāska<sup>9</sup> of the Kuru brothers,
{@Devāpi@} and {@Śantanu,@} the value of which, as evidence of
contemporary views, is not seriously affected by the legend
itself being of dubious character and validity.
<div n="P"/>Royal power was clearly insecure: there are several references
to kings being expelled from their realms, and their efforts to
recover their sovereignty,<sup>10</sup> and the Atharvaveda contains spells
in the interest of royalty.<sup>11</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%The King in War.%} — Naturally the Vedic texts, after the Rig-
veda, contain few notices of the warlike adventures that no
doubt formed a very considerable proportion of the royal
functions. But the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>12</sup> contains the state-
ment that the {@Kuru-Pañcāla@} kings, who, like the Brahmins of
[Page2-212+ 71]
those tribes, stand as representatives of good form, used to
make their raids in the dewy season. The word {@Udāja,@} too,
with its variant Nirāja, records that kings took a share of the
booty of war. The Rigveda<sup>13</sup> has many references to Vedic
wars: it is clear that the Kṣatriyas were at least as intent on
fulfilling their duty of war as the Brahmins on sacrificing and
their other functions. Moreover, beside offensive war, defence
was a chief duty of the king: he is emphatically the ‘protector
of the tribe’ ({%gopā janasya%}), or, as is said in the {@Rājasūya@}
(‘royal consecration’), ‘protector of the Brahmin.’<sup>14</sup> His
{@Purohita@} was expected to use his spells and charms to secure
the success of his king's arms. The king no doubt fought in
person: so {@Pratardana@} met death in war according to the
Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad;<sup>15</sup> and in the Rājasūya the king is invoked
as ‘sacker of cities’ ({%purāṃ bhettā%}).
<div n="P"/>{%The King in Peace.%} — In return for his warlike services the
king received the obedience<sup>16</sup> — sometimes forced<sup>17</sup> — of the
people, and in particular their contributions for the mainten-
ance of royalty. The king is regularly<sup>18</sup> regarded as ‘devouring
[Page2-213+ 50]
the people,’ but this phrase must not be explained as meaning that
he necessarily oppressed them. It obviously has its origin in a
custom by which the king and his retinue were fed by the
people's contributions, a plan with many parallels. It is also
probable that the king could assign the royal right of mainten-
ance to a Kṣatriya, thus developing a nobility supported by the
people. Taxation would not normally fall on Kṣatriya or
Brahmin; the texts contain emphatic assertions of the exemp-
tion of the goods of the latter from the royal bounty.<sup>19</sup>In
the people, however, lay the strength of the king.<sup>20</sup> See also
{@Bali.@}
<div n="P"/>In return the king performed the duties of judge. Himself
immune from punishment ({%a-daṇḍya%}), he wields the rod of
punishment ({@Daṇḍa@}).<sup>21</sup> It is probable that criminal justice
remained largely in his actual administration, for the Sūtras<sup>22</sup>
preserve clear traces of the personal exercise of royal criminal
jurisdiction. Possibly the jurisdiction could be exercised by a
royal officer, or even by a delegate, for a Rājanya is mentioned
as an overseer ({%adhyakṣa%}) of the punishment of a Śūdra in the
Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā.<sup>23</sup> In civil justice it may be that the king
played a much less prominent part, save as a court of final
appeal, but evidence is lacking on this head. The {@Madhyamaśī@}
of the Rigveda was probably not a royal, but a private
judge or arbitrator. A wide criminal jurisdiction is, how-
ever, to some extent supported<sup>24</sup> by the frequent mention of
Varuṇa's spies, for Varuṇa is the divine counterpart of the
human king.<sup>25</sup> Possibly such spies could be used in war
also.<sup>26</sup>
<div n="P"/>There is no reference in early Vedic literature to the exercise
of legislative activity by the king, though later it is an essential
[Page2-214+ 52]
part of his duties.<sup>27</sup> Nor can we say exactly what executive
functions devolved on the king.
<div n="P"/>In all his acts the king was regularly advised by his {@Puro-@}
{@hita;@} he also had the advantage of the advice of the royal
ministers and attendants (see {@Ratnin@}). The local administra-
tion was entrusted to the {@Grāmaṇī,@} or village chief, who may
have been selected or appointed by the king. The outward signs
of the king's rank were his palace<sup>28</sup> and his brilliant dress.<sup>29</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%The King as Landowner.%} — The position of the king with
regard to the land is somewhat obscure. The Greek notices,<sup>30</sup>
in which, unhappily, it would be dangerous to put much trust,
since they were collected by observers who were probably little
used to accurate investigations of such matters, and whose
statements were based on inadequate information, vary in their
statements. In part they speak of rent being paid, and declare
that only the king and no private person could own land, while
in part they refer to the taxation of land. Hopkins<sup>31</sup> is strongly
of opinion that the payments made were paid for protection
-{%i.e.,%} in modern terminology as a tax, but that the king was
recognized as the owner of all the land, while yet the individual
or the joint family also owned the land. As against Baden-
Powell,<sup>32</sup> who asserted that the idea of the king as a landowner
was later, he urges for the Vedic period that the king, as we
have seen, is described as devouring the people, and that,
according to the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>33</sup> the {@Vaiśya@} can be
devoured at will and maltreated (but, unlike the {@Śūdra,@} not
killed); and for the period of the legal Sūtras and Śāstras he
cites Bṛhaspati and Nārada as clearly recognizing the king's
overlordship, besides a passage of the Mānava Dharma Śāstra<sup>34</sup>
which describes the king as ‘lord of all,’ a phrase which
[Page2-215+ 59]
Bühler<sup>35</sup> was inclined to interpret as a proof of landowning.
The evidence is, however, inadequate to prove what is sought.
It is not denied that gradually the king came to be vaguely con-
ceived — as the English king still is — as lord of all the land in a
proprietorial sense, but it is far more probable that such an idea
was only a gradual development than that it was primitive.
The power of devouring the people is a political power, not a
right of ownership; precisely the same feature can be traced in
South Africa,<sup>36</sup> where the chief can deprive a man arbitrarily of
his land, though the land is really owned by the native. The
matter is ultimately to some extent one of terminology, but the
parallel cases are in favour of distinguishing between the
political rights of the crown, which can be transferred by way
of a grant, and the rights of ownership. Hopkins<sup>37</sup> thinks
that the gifts of land to priests, which seems to be the first
sign of land transactions in the Brāhmaṇas, was an actual gift
of land; it may have been so in many cases, but it may easily
also have been the grant of a superiority: the Epic grants are
hardly decisive one way or the other.

{@Rājanya@}¦ is the regular term in Vedic literature<sup>1</sup> for a man of
the royal family, probably including also those who were not
actually members of that family, but were nobles, though it
may have been originally restricted to members of the royal
family. This, however, does not appear clearly from any
passage; the term may originally have applied to all the nobles
irrespective of kingly power. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>2</sup>
the Rājanya is different from the Rājaputra, who is literally a
son of the king. The functions and place of the Rājanya are
described under {@Kṣatriya,@} which expression later normally
takes the place of Rājanya as a designation for the ruling class.
His high place is shown by the fact that in the Taittirīya

rite is described at great length in the Sūtras,<sup>3</sup> but its main
features are clearly outlined in the Brāhmaṇas,<sup>4</sup> while the
verses used in the ceremony are preserved in the Saṃhitās of
the Yajurveda.<sup>5</sup> Besides much mere priestly elaboration, the
ritual contains traces of popular ceremonial. For example, the
king is clothed in the ceremonial garments of his rank, and
provided with bow and arrow as emblems of sovereignty. He
is formally anointed; he performs a mimic cow raid against a
relative of his;<sup>6</sup> or engages in a sham fight with a {@Rājanya.@}<sup>7</sup>
A game of dice is played in which he is made to be the victim;<sup>8</sup>
he symbolically ascends the quarters of the sky as an indication
of his universal rule; and steps on a tiger skin, thus gaining
the strength and the pre-eminence of the tiger.

‘sovereign power,’ from which, as the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup>
notes, the Brahmin is excluded.
<div n="P"/>In addition to Rājya, the texts give other expressions of
sovereign power. Thus the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>4</sup> contends
[Page2-221+ 43]
that the Rājasūya sacrifice is that of a king, the {@Vājapeya@} that
of a Samrāj or emperor, the status of the latter (Sāmrājya)
being superior to that of the former (Rājya). The sitting on a
throne ({@Āsandī@}) is given in the same text<sup>5</sup> as one of the
characteristics of the Samrāj. Elsewhere<sup>6</sup> Svārājya, ‘uncon-
trolled dominion,’ is opposed to Rājya. In the ritual of the
{@Rājasūya@} the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>7</sup> gives a whole series of
terms: Rājya, Sāmrājya, Bhaujya, Svārājya, Vairājya, Pāra-
meṣṭhya, and Māhārājya, while Ādhipatya, ‘supreme power,’ is
found elsewhere.<sup>8</sup> But there is no reason to believe that these
terms refer to essentially different forms of authority. A king
might be called a {@Mahārāja@} or a {@Samrāj,@} without really being
an overlord of kings; he would be so termed if he were an
important sovereign, or by his own entourage out of compli-
ment, as was {@Janaka@} of {@Videha.@}<sup>9</sup> That a really great monarchy
of the Aśoka or Gupta type ever existed in the Vedic period
seems highly improbable.<sup>10</sup>

either married or as seeking a husband, or as a bride in the

form of the root {%vah,%} ‘to carry,’ as is {%vahatu,%} ‘the bridal pro-
cession,’ thus meaning ‘she who is to be or has been conducted
home.’ Zimmer,<sup>4</sup> however, objects to this explanation,
regarding {%vadhū%} as a derivative from a different root meaning
‘to marry.’

2. {@Vadhū@}¦ is in one passage of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> taken by Roth<sup>2</sup>
to denote a ‘female animal,’ while Zimmer<sup>3</sup> urges that it
means a ‘female slave.’ As far as the use of Vadhū goes,
either meaning is abnormal, for if Vadhū never elsewhere
[Page2-240+ 44]
means a female animal (from {%vah,%} to ‘draw’ a cart), neither does
it denote a slave: as the passage refers to a gift of fifty Vadhūs
by {@Trasadasyu Paurukutsya@} to the singer, the latter must
have been a polygamist of an advanced type to require fifty
wives. The same doubt arises in the case of {%vadhūmant,%} which
is used in the Rigveda and Atharvaveda as an epithet of the
chariot ({@Ratha@}),<sup>4</sup> of horses ({@Aśva@}),<sup>5</sup> and of buffaloes ({@Uṣṭra@}).<sup>6</sup>
Zimmer sees in all cases a reference to slaves in the chariots or
with the horses: this interpretation has the support of the
Bṛhaddevatā.<sup>7</sup> Roth's version of the references to horses or
buffaloes as ‘suitable for draught’ is not very happy; if {%vadhū%}
is really a female animal {%vadhūmant%} means rather ‘together with
mares,’ or ‘together with female buffaloes,’ which makes reason-
able sense.<sup>8</sup>

1. {@Varṇa,@}¦ ‘colour,’ is a common word in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and
later.<sup>2</sup> A large number of colours are enumerated in Vedic
literature, but it is not possible to deduce any clear information
as to the accuracy with which the Vedic Indian distinguished
colours, or as to the principle on which his distinctions were based.
The Rigveda seems to show that red or yellow colours were
the most noticed, but this may be accidental.<sup>3</sup> ‘Black’ or
‘dark’ is denoted by {%kṛṣṇa,%} ‘white’ or ‘light-coloured’ by {%śukla%}
or {%śveta.%} ‘Black’ seems to be meant in one passage of the
Rigveda<sup>4</sup> by {%śyenī%} also. ‘Dark-grey’ or ‘dusky’ is expressed
by {%śyāma.%}<sup>5</sup> The sense of {%nīla%}<sup>6</sup> is doubtful, perhaps ‘dark-blue,’
‘bluish-black.’ The series of words {%hari, hariṇa, harit, harita,%}
seems, on the whole, to denote ‘yellow,’ but ‘green’ is also a
possible rendering, since the epithet is used of the frog.<sup>7</sup>
‘Brown’ is certainly the meaning of {%babhru,%} which is used of
the {@Vibhītaka@} nut (see {@Akṣa@}). ‘Reddish-brown’ seems to be
the tinge implied by {%kapila%}<sup>8</sup> (‘monkey-coloured’), while {%piṅgala%}
appears to denote a shade of brown in which yellow pre-
[Page2-247+ 66]
dominates, ‘tawny.’<sup>9</sup> ‘Yellow’ is expressed by {%pīta%} as well as
{%pāṇḍu.%}<sup>10</sup> A garment of saffron ({%māhārajana%}) is mentioned in the
Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad.<sup>11</sup> {%Rudhira%} and {%lohita%} are red, while
{%aruṇa%} is ‘ruddy.’ {%Kalmāṣa%} means ‘spotted,’<sup>12</sup> and {%śilpa%}

2. {@Varṇa@}¦ (lit. ‘colour’) in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> is applied to denote
classes of men, the {@Dāsa@} and the Āryan Varṇa being contrasted,
as other passages<sup>2</sup> show, on account of colour. But this use is
confined to distinguishing two colours: in this respect the
Rigveda differs fundamentally from the later Saṃhitās and
Brāhmaṇas,<sup>3</sup> where the four castes ({%varṇāḥ%}) are already fully
recognized.
<div n="P"/>{%(a) Caste in the Rigveda.%} — The use of the term Varṇa is not,
of course, conclusive for the question whether caste existed
in the Rigveda. In one sense it must be admitted to have
existed: the Puruṣa-sūkta, ‘hymn of man,’ in the tenth
[Page2-248+ 49]
Maṇḍala<sup>4</sup> clearly contemplates the division of mankind into
four classes — the Brāhmaṇa, Rājanya, Vaiśya, and Śūdra. But
the hymn being admittedly late,<sup>5</sup> its evidence is not cogent for
the bulk of the Rigveda. Zimmer<sup>6</sup> has with great force com-
batted the view that the Rigveda was produced in a society
that knew the caste system. He points out that the Brāh-
maṇas<sup>7</sup> show us the Vedic Indians on the Indus as unbrah-
minized, and not under the caste system; he argues that the
Rigveda was the product of tribes living in the Indus region
and the Panjab; later on a part of this people, who had
wandered farther east, developed the peculiar civilization of the
caste system. He adopts the arguments of Muir,<sup>8</sup> derived
from the study of the data of the Rigveda, viz.: that ({%a%}) the
four castes appear only in the late Puruṣasūkta; ({%b%}) the term
Varṇa, as shown above, covers the three highest castes of later
times, and is only contrasted with Dāsa; ({%c%}) that Brāhmaṇa is
rare in the Rigveda, Kṣatriya occurs seldom,<sup>9</sup> Rājanya only in
the Puruṣasūkta, where too, alone, Vaiśya and Śūdra are
found; ({%d%}) that Brahman denotes at first ‘poet,’ ‘sage,’ and
then ‘officiating priest,’ or still later a special class of priest;
({%e%}) that in some only of the passages<sup>10</sup> where it occurs does
Brahman denote a ‘priest by profession,’ while in others it
denotes something peculiar to the individual, designating a
person distinguished for genius or virtue, or specially chosen to
receive divine inspiration.<sup>11</sup> Brāhmaṇa, on the other hand, as
Muir admits,<sup>12</sup> already denotes a hereditary professional priest-
hood.
<div n="P"/>Zimmer connects the change from the casteless system of the
Rigveda to the elaborate system of the Yajurveda with the
[Page2-249+ 46]
advance of the Vedic Indians to the east, comparing the Ger-
manic invasions that transformed the German tribes into
monarchies closely allied with the church. The needs of a
conquering people evoke the monarch; the lesser princes sink
to the position of nobles; for repelling the attacks of aborigines
or of other Āryan tribes, and for quelling the revolts of the
subdued population, the state requires a standing army in the
shape of the armed retainers of the king, and beside the nobility
of the lesser princes arises that of the king's chief retainers,
as the Thegns supplemented the Gesiths of the Anglo-Saxon
monarchies.<sup>13</sup> At the same time the people ceased to take
part in military matters, and under climatic influences
left the conduct of war to the nobility and their retainers,
devoting themselves to agriculture, pastoral pursuits, and
trade. But the advantage won by the nobles over the
people was shared by them with the priesthood, the
origin of whose power lies in the Purohitaship, as Roth
first saw.<sup>14</sup>
<div n="P"/>Originally the prince could sacrifice for himself and the
people, but the Rigveda<sup>15</sup> itself shows cases, like those of
{@Viśvāmitra@} and {@Vasiṣṭha@} illustrating forcibly the power of the
Purohita, though at the same time the right of the noble to act
as Purohita is seen in the case of {@Devāpi Ārṣṭiṣeṇa.@}<sup>16</sup> The
Brahmins saw their opportunity, through the Purohitaship, of
gaining practical power during the confusion and difficulties of
the wars of invasion, and secured it, though only after many
struggles, the traces of which are seen in the Epic tradition.<sup>17</sup>
The Atharvaveda<sup>18</sup> also preserves relics of these conflicts in its
narration of the ruin of the {@Sṛñjayas@} because of oppressing
Brahmins, and besides other hymns of the Atharvaveda (viii-
xii), the Śatarudriya litany of the Yajurveda<sup>19</sup> reflects the
period of storm and stress when the aboriginal population was
[Page2-250+ 56]
still seething with discontent, and Rudra was worshipped as
the patron god of all sorts of evil doers.<sup>20</sup>
<div n="P"/>This version of the development of caste has received a good
deal of acceptance in its main outlines, and it may almost be
regarded as the recognized version.<sup>21</sup> It has, however, always
been opposed by some scholars, such as Haug,<sup>22</sup> Kern,<sup>23</sup>
Ludwig,<sup>24</sup> and more recently by Oldenberg<sup>25</sup> and by Geldner.<sup>26</sup>
The matter may be to some extent simplified by recognizing
at once that the caste system is one that has progressively
developed, and that it is not legitimate to see in the Rigveda
the full caste system even of the Yajurveda; but at the same
time it is difficult to doubt that the system was already well on
its way to general acceptance. The argument from the non-
brahminical character of the {@Vrātyas@} of the Indus and Panjab
loses its force when it is remembered that there is much
evidence in favour of placing the composition of the bulk of the
Rigveda, especially the books<sup>27</sup> in which {@Sudās@} appears with
Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra, in the east, the later {@Madhyadeśa,@} a
view supported by Pischel,<sup>28</sup> Geldner,<sup>29</sup> Hopkins,<sup>30</sup> and Mac-
donell.<sup>31</sup> Nor is it possible to maintain that Brahman in the
Rigveda merely means a ‘poet’ or ‘sage.’ It is admitted by
Muir that in some passages it must mean a hereditary pro-
fession; in fact, there is not a single passage in which it occurs
where the sense of ‘priest’ is not allowable, since the priest
was of course the singer. Moreover, there are traces in the
Rigveda of the threefold<sup>32</sup> or fourfold<sup>33</sup> division of the people
[Page2-251+ 41]
into {%brahma, kṣatram,%} and {%viśaḥ,%} or into the three classes and
the servile population. Nor even in respect to the later period,
any more than to the Rigveda, is the view correct that regards
the Vaiśyas as not taking part in war. The Rigveda evidently<sup>34</sup>
knows of no restriction of war to a nobility and its retainers,
but the late Atharvaveda<sup>35</sup> equally classes the folk with the
{%bala,%} ‘power,’ representing the Viś as associated with the {@Sabhā,@}
{@Samiti,@} and {@Senā,@} the assemblies of the people and the armed
host. Zimmer<sup>36</sup> explains these references as due to tradition
only; but this is hardly a legitimate argument, resting, as it
does, on the false assumption that only a Kṣatriya can fight.
But it is (see {@Kṣatriya@}) very doubtful whether Kṣatriya means
anything more than a member of the nobility, though later, in
the Epic, it included the retainers of the nobility, who increased
in numbers with the growth of military monarchies, and though
later the ordinary people did not necessarily take part in wars,
an abstention that is, however, much exaggerated if it is treated
as an absolute one. The Kṣatriyas were no doubt a hereditary
body; monarchy was already hereditary (see {@Rājan@}), and it is
admitted that the Śūdras were a separate body: thus all the
elements of the caste system were already in existence. The
Purohita, indeed, was a person of great importance, but it is
clear, as Oldenberg<sup>37</sup> urges, that he was not the creator of the
power of the priesthood, but owed his position, and the influence
he could in consequence exert, to the fact that the sacrifice
required for its proper performance the aid of a hereditary
priest in whose possession was the traditional sacred know-
ledge.
<div n="P"/>Nor can any argument for the non-existence of the caste
system be derived from cases like that of {@Devāpi.@} For, in the
first place, the Upaniṣads show kings in the exercise of the
priestly functions of learning and teaching, and the Upaniṣads
are certainly contemporaneous with an elaborated caste system.
In the second place the Rigvedic evidence is very weak, for
Devāpi, who certainly acts as Purohita, is not stated in the
[Page2-252+ 61]
Rigveda to be a prince at all, though Yāska<sup>38</sup> calls him a
Kauravya; the hymns attributed to kings and others cannot be
vindicated for them by certain evidence, though here, again,
the Brāhmaṇas do not scruple to recognize Rājanyarṣis, or
‘royal sages’; and the famous Viśvāmitra shows in the Rigveda
no sign of the royal character which the Brāhmaṇas insist
on fastening on him in the shape of royal descent in the line of
{@Jahnu.@}<sup>39</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%(b) Caste in the later Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas.%} — The relation
between the later and the earlier periods of the Vedic history
of caste must probably be regarded in the main as the
hardening of a system already formed by the time of the
Rigveda.
<div n="P"/>1. {%The Names of the Castes.%} — The most regular names are
Brāhmaṇa, Rājanya, Vaiśya, and Śūdra,<sup>40</sup> or later Brāhmaṇa,
Kṣatriya, Vaiśya, and Śūdra.<sup>41</sup> There are many other variants:
Brahman, Kṣatra, Śūdrāryau;<sup>42</sup> Brahman, Rājanya, Śūdra,
Ārya;<sup>43</sup> Brahman, Rājanya, Vaiśya, Śūdra;<sup>44</sup> Brāhmaṇa, Rājan,
Viśya, Śūdra;<sup>45</sup> Deva, Rājan, Śūdra, Ārya;<sup>46</sup> and Brahman,
Kṣatra, Viś, and Śūdra.<sup>47</sup> In other cases the fourth class is repre-
sented by a special member: Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya, Vaiśya, and
Cāṇḍāla.<sup>48</sup> Often only the three upper classes are mentioned,
as Brāhmaṇa, Rājanya, Vaiśya;<sup>49</sup> Brahman, Kṣatram, Viś,<sup>50</sup>
[Page2-253+ 64]
etc.<sup>51</sup> Three castes — Brāhmaṇa, Rājan, Śūdra — are mentioned
in the Atharvaveda,<sup>52</sup> and two castes are repeatedly men-
tioned together, either Brahman and Kṣatra, or Kṣatra and
Viś.<sup>53</sup>
<div n="P"/>2. {%The Relation of the Castes.%} — The ritual literature is full of
minute differences respecting the castes. Thus, for example,
the Śatapatha prescribes different sizes of funeral mounds for
the four castes,<sup>54</sup> Different modes of address are laid down for
the four castes,<sup>55</sup> as {%ehi,%} ‘approach’; {%āgaccha,%} ‘come’; {%ādrava,%}
‘run up’; {%ādhāva,%} ‘hasten up,’ which differ in degrees of
politeness. The representatives of the four castes are dedicated
at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’) to different deities.<sup>56</sup>
The Sūtras have many similar rules.<sup>57</sup>
<div n="P"/>But the three upper castes in some respects differ markedly
from the fourth, the Śūdras. The latter are in the Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa<sup>58</sup> declared not fit to be addressed by a Dīkṣita,
‘consecrated person,’ and no Śūdra is to milk the cow whose
milk is to be used for the Agnihotra<sup>59</sup> (‘fire-oblation’). On the
other hand, in certain passages, the Śūdra is given a place in
the Soma sacrifice,<sup>60</sup> and in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>61</sup> there
are given formulæ for the placing of the sacrificial fire not only
for the three upper castes, but also for the {@Rathakāra,@}
[Page2-254+ 57]
‘chariot-maker.’ Again, in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>62</sup> the Brāh-
maṇa is opposed as ‘eater of the oblation’ to the members of
the other three castes.
<div n="P"/>The characteristics of the several castes are given under
{@Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya@} and {@Rājan, Vaiśya, Śūdra:@} they may be
briefly summed up as follows: The Viś forms the basis of the
state on which the Brahman and Kṣatra rest;<sup>63</sup> the Brahman
and Kṣatra are superior to the Viś;<sup>64</sup> while all three classes are
superior to the Śūdras. The real power of the state rested with
the king and his nobles, with their retainers, who may be
deemed the Kṣatriya element. Engaged in the business of the
protection of the country, its administration, the decision of
legal cases, and in war, the nobles subsisted, no doubt, on the
revenues in kind levied from the people, the king granting to
them villages (see {@Grāma@}) for their maintenance, while some of
them, no doubt, had lands of their own cultivated for them by
slaves or by tenants. The states were seemingly small:<sup>65</sup> there
are no clear signs of any really large kingdoms, despite the
mention of {@Mahārājas.@} The people, engaged in agriculture,
pastoral pursuits, and trade ({@Vaṇij@}), paid tribute to the king
and nobles for the protection afforded them. That, as Baden-
Powell suggests,<sup>66</sup> they were not themselves agriculturists is
probably erroneous; some might be landowners on a large
scale, and draw their revenues from Śūdra tenants, or even
Āryan tenants, but that the people as a whole were in this
[Page2-255+ 70]
position is extremely unlikely.<sup>67</sup> In war the people shared
the conflicts of the nobles, for there was not yet any absolute
separation of the functions of the several classes. The priests
may be divided into two classes — the Purohitas of the kings,
who guided their employers by their counsel, and were in a
position to acquire great influence in the state, as it is evident
they actually did, and the ordinary priests who led quiet lives,
except when they were engaged on some great festival of a king
or a wealthy noble.<sup>68</sup>
<div n="P"/>The relations and functions of the castes are well summed up
in a passage of the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>69</sup> which treats of them
as opposed to the Kṣatriya. The Brāhmaṇa is a receiver of
gifts ({%ā-dāyī%}), a drinker of Soma ({%ā-pāyī%}), a seeker of food
({%āvasāyī%}),<sup>70</sup> and liable to removal at will ({%yathākāma-prayāpyaḥ%}).<sup>71</sup>
The Vaiśya is tributary to another ({%anyasya balikṛt%}), to be lived
on by another ({%anyasyādyaḥ%}), and to be oppressed at will ({%yathā-%}
{%kāma-jyeyaḥ%}).<sup>72</sup> The Śūdra is the servant of another ({%anyasya%}
{%preṣyaḥ%}), to be expelled at will ({%kāmotthāpyaḥ%}), and to be slain
[Page2-256+ 54]
at pleasure ({%yathākāma-vadhyaḥ%}).<sup>73</sup> The descriptions seem
calculated to show the relation of each of the castes to the
Rājanya. Even the Brāhmaṇa he can control, whilst the
Vaiśya is his inferior and tributary, whom he can remove
without cause from his land,<sup>74</sup> but who is still free, and whom
he cannot maim or slay without due process. The Śūdra has
no rights of property or life against the noble, especially the
king.
<div n="P"/>The passage is a late one, and the high place of the Kṣatriya
is to some extent accounted for by this fact. It is clear that in
the course of time the Vaiśya fell more and more in position
with the hardening of the divisions of caste. Weber<sup>75</sup> shows
reason for believing that the Vājapeya sacrifice, a festival of
which a chariot race forms an integral part,<sup>76</sup> was, as the
Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra<sup>77</sup> says, once a sacrifice for a Vaiśya,
as well as for a priest or king. But the king, too, had to suffer
diminution of his influence at the hands of the priest: the
Taittirīya texts<sup>78</sup> show that the Vājapeya was originally a lesser
sacrifice which, in the case of a king, was followed by the
Rājasūya, or consecration of him as an overlord of lesser kings,
and in that of the Brahmin by the Bṛhaspatisava, a festival
celebrated on his appointment as a royal Purohita. But the
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>79</sup> exalts the Vājapeya, in which a priest
could be the sacrificer, over the Rājasūya, from which he was
excluded, and identifies it with the Bṛhaspatisava, a clear piece
of juggling in the interests of the priestly pretentions. But we
must not overestimate the value of such passages, or the
exaltation of the Purohita in the later books of the Śatapatha
[Page2-257+ 60]
and Aitareya Brāhmaṇas as evidence of a real growth in the
priestly power: these books represent the views of the priests
of what their own powers should be, and to some extent were in
the Madhyadeśa. Another side of the picture is presented in
the Pāli literature,<sup>80</sup> which, belonging to a later period than the
Vedic, undoubtedly underestimates the position of the priests;
while the Epic,<sup>81</sup> more nearly contemporaneous with the later
Vedic period, displays, despite all priestly redaction, the temporal
superiority of the nobility in clear light.
<div n="P"/>Although clear distinctions were made between the different
castes, there is little trace in Vedic literature of one of the
leading characteristics of the later system, the impurity com-
municated by the touch or contact of the inferior castes,<sup>82</sup>
which is seen both directly in the purification rendered
necessary in case of contact with a Śūdra, and indirectly in the
prohibition of eating in company with men of lower caste.<sup>83</sup> It
is true that prohibition of eating in company with others does
appear,<sup>84</sup> but not in connexion with caste: its purpose is to
preserve the peculiar sanctity of those who perform a certain
rite or believe in a certain doctrine; for persons who eat of the
same food together, according to primitive thought, acquire
the same characteristics and enter into a sacramental com-
munion. But Vedic literature does not yet show that to
take food from an inferior caste was forbidden as destroying
[Page2-258+ 58]
purity.<sup>85</sup> Nor, of course, has the caste system developed the
constitution with a head, a council, and common festivals
which the modern caste has; for such an organization is not
found even in the Epic or in the Pāli literature.<sup>86</sup> The Vedic
characteristics of caste are heredity, pursuit of a common
occupation, and restriction on intermarriage.
<div n="P"/>3. {%Restrictions on Intermarriage.%} — Arrian, in his {%Indica,%}<sup>87</sup>
probably on the authority of Megasthenes, makes the prohibi-
tion of marriage between <lang n="greek">γένη</lang>, no doubt ‘castes,’ a characteristic
of Indian life. The evidence of Pāli literature<sup>88</sup> is in favour of
this view, though it shows that a king could marry whom he
wished, and could make his son by that wife the heir apparent.
But it equally shows that there were others who held that not
the father's but the mother's rank determined the social
standing of the son. Though Manu<sup>89</sup> recognizes the possibility
of marriage with the next lower caste as producing legitimate
children, still he condemns the marriage of an Āryan with
a woman of lower caste. The Pāraskara Gṛhya Sūtra<sup>90</sup> allows
the marriage of a Kṣatriya with a wife of his own caste or of
the lower caste, of a Brahmin with a wife of his own caste or
of the two lower classes, and of a Vaiśya with a Vaiśya wife
only. But it quotes the opinion of others that all of them can
marry a Śūdra wife, while other authorities condemn the
marriage with a Śūdra wife in certain circumstances, which
implies that in other cases it might be justified.<sup>91</sup> The earlier
[Page2-259+ 64]
literature bears out this impression: much stress is laid on
descent from a Ṛṣi, and on purity of descent;<sup>92</sup> but there is
other evidence for the view that even a Brāhmaṇa need not be
of pure lineage. {@Kavaṣa@} Ailūṣa is taunted with being the son
of a Dāsī, ‘slave woman,’<sup>93</sup> and {@Vatsa@} was accused of being a
Śūdrā's son, but established his purity by walking unhurt
through the flames of a fire ordeal.<sup>94</sup> He who is learned
({%śuśruvān%}) is said to be a Brāhmaṇa, descended from a Ṛṣi
({%ārṣeya%}), in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā;<sup>95</sup> and {@Satyakāma,@} son of
{@Jabālā,@} was accepted as a pupil by {@Hāridrumata@} Gautama,
though he could not name his father.<sup>96</sup> The Kāṭhaka Saṃ-
hitā<sup>97</sup> says that knowledge is all-important, not descent. But
all this merely goes to show that there was a measure of laxity
in the hereditary character of caste, not that it was not based
on heredity. The Yajurveda Saṃhitās<sup>98</sup> recognize the illicit
union of Ārya and Śūdrā, and {%vice versa:%} it is not unlikely that
if illicit unions took place, legal marriage was quite possible.
The Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>99</sup> indeed, recognizes such a case in
that of {@Dīrghatamas,@} son of the slave girl Uśij, if we may
adopt the description of Uśij given in the Bṛhaddevatā.<sup>100</sup>
<div n="P"/>In a hymn of the Atharvaveda<sup>101</sup> extreme claims are put
[Page2-260+ 54]
forward for the Brāhmaṇa, who alone is a true husband and
the real husband, even if the woman has had others, a Rājanya
or a Vaiśya: a Śūdra husband is not mentioned, probably on
purpose.<sup>102</sup> The marriage of Brāhmaṇas with Rājanya women
is illustrated by the cases of {@Sukanyā,@} daughter of king
{@Śaryāta,@} who married {@Cyavana,@}<sup>103</sup> and of {@Rathavīti's@} daughter,
who married {@Śyāvāśva.@}<sup>104</sup>
<div n="P"/>4. {%Occupation and Caste.%} — The Greek authorities<sup>105</sup> and the
evidence of the Jātakas<sup>106</sup> concur in showing it to have been
the general rule that each caste was confined to its own
occupations, but that the Brāhmaṇas did engage in many
professions beside that of simple priest, while all castes gave
members to the Śramaṇas, or homeless ascetics. The Jātakas<sup>107</sup>
recognize the Brahmins as engaged in all sorts of occupations,
as merchants, traders, agriculturists, and so forth. Matters are
somewhat simpler in Vedic literature, where the Brāhmaṇas
and Kṣatriyas appear as practically confined to their own pro-
fessions of sacrifice and military or administrative functions.
Ludwig<sup>108</sup> sees in {@Dīrghaśravas@} in the Rigveda<sup>109</sup> a Brahmin
reduced by indigence to acting as a merchant, as allowed even
later by the Sūtra literature; but this is not certain, though it
is perfectly possible. More interesting is the question how far
the Kṣatriyas practised the duties of priests; the evidence here
is conflicting. The best known case is, of course, that of
{@Viśvāmitra.@} In the Rigveda he appears merely as a priest
who is attached to the court of {@Sudās,@} king of the {@Tṛtsus;@} but
in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>110</sup> he is called a king, a descendant
of {@Jahnu,@} and the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>111</sup> refers to {@Śunaḥśepa's@}
[Page2-261+ 52]
succeeding, through his adoption by Viśvāmitra, to the divine
lore ({%daiva veda%}) of the {@Gāthins@} and the lordship of the Jahnus.
That in fact this tradition is correct seems most improbable,
but it serves at least to illustrate the existence of seers of royal
origin. Such figures appear more than once in the Pañcaviṃśa
Brāhmaṇa,<sup>112</sup> which knows the technical terms {@Rājanyarṣi@} and
{@Devarājan@} corresponding to the later Rājarṣi, ‘royal sage.’ The
Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>113</sup> says of one who knows a certain
doctrine, ‘being a king he becomes a seer’ ({%rājā sann ṛṣir%}
{%bhavati%}), and the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa<sup>114</sup> applies the
term Rājanya to a Brāhmaṇa. Again, it is argued that {@Devāpi@}
{@Ārṣṭiṣeṇa,@} who acted as Purohita, according to the Rigveda,<sup>115</sup>
for {@Śantanu,@} was a prince, as Yāska<sup>116</sup> says or implies he
was.<sup>117</sup> But this assumption seems to be only an error of
Yāska's. Since nothing in the Rigveda alludes to any relation-
ship, it is impossible to accept Sieg's view<sup>118</sup> that the Rigveda
recognizes the two as brothers, but presents the fact of a prince
acting the part of Purohita as unusual and requiring explanation.
The principle, however, thus accepted by Sieg as to princes in
the Rigveda seems sound enough. Again, Muir<sup>119</sup> has argued
that Hindu tradition, as shown in Sāyaṇa,<sup>120</sup> regards many
hymns of the Rigveda as composed by royal personages, but he
admits that in many cases the ascription is wrong; it may be
added that in the case of {@Pṛthī Vainya,@} where the hymn<sup>121</sup>
ascribed to him seems to be his, it is not shown in the hymn
itself that he is other than a seer; the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>122</sup>
calls him a king, but that is probably of no more value than
the later tradition as to Viśvāmitra. The case of {@Viśvantara@}
[Page2-262+ 54]
and the {@Śyāparṇas@} mentioned in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>123</sup> has
been cited<sup>124</sup> as that of a king sacrificing without priestly aid,
but the interpretation is quite uncertain, while the parallel of
the {@Kaśyapas, Asitamṛgas,@} and {@Bhūtavīras@} mentioned in the
course of the narrative renders it highly probable that the king
had other priests to carry out the sacrifice.
<div n="P"/>Somewhat different are a series of other cases found in the
Upaniṣads, where the Brahma doctrine is ascribed to royal
persons. Thus {@Janaka@} is said in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>125</sup>
to have become a Brahman; {@Ajātaśatru@} taught {@Gārgya@}
{@Bālāki;@}<sup>126</sup> {@Pravāhaṇa Jaivali@} instructed {@Śvetaketu Āruṇeya,@}<sup>127</sup>
as well as {@Śilaka Śālāvatya@}<sup>128</sup> and {@Caikitāyana Dālbhya;@}
and {@Aśvapati Kaikeya@} taught Brahmins.<sup>129</sup> It has been
deduced<sup>130</sup> from such passages that the Brahma doctrine was a
product of the Kṣatriyas. This conclusion is, however, entirely
doubtful,<sup>131</sup> for kings were naturally willing to be flattered by
the ascription to them of philosophic activity, and elsewhere<sup>132</sup>
the opinion of a Rājanya is treated with contempt.
<div n="P"/>It is probably a fair deduction that the royal caste did not
much concern itself with the sacred lore of the priests, though
it is not unlikely that individual exceptions occurred. But
that warriors became priests, that an actual change of caste
took place, is quite unproved by a single genuine example.
That it was impossible we cannot say, but it seems not to have
taken place. To be distinguished from a caste change, as Fick<sup>133</sup>
points out, is the fact that a member of any caste could, in the
later period at least, become a Śramaṇa, as is recorded in effect
[Page2-263+ 53]
of many kings in the Epic.<sup>134</sup> Whether the practice is Vedic is
not clear: Yāska<sup>135</sup> records it of Devāpi, but this is not evidence
for times much anterior to the rise of Buddhism.
<div n="P"/>On the other hand, the Brahmins, or at least the Purohitas,
accompanied the princes in battle, and probably, like the
mediæval clergy, were not unprepared to fight,<sup>136</sup> as Vasiṣṭha
and Viśvāmitra seem to have done, and as priests do even in
the Epic from time to time.<sup>137</sup> But a priest cannot be said to
change caste by acting in this way.
<div n="P"/>More generally the possibility of the occurrence of change of
caste may be seen in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>138</sup> where
{@Śyāparṇa Sāyakāyana@} is represented as speaking of his off-
spring as if they could have become the nobles, priests, and
commons of the Śalvas; and in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,<sup>139</sup>
where Viśvantara is told that if the wrong offering were made
his children would be of the three other castes. A drunken Ṛṣi
of the Rigveda<sup>140</sup> talks as if he could be converted into a king.
On the other hand, certain kings, such as {@Para Āṭṇāra,@} are
spoken of as performers of Sattras, ‘sacrificial sessions.’<sup>141</sup> As
evidence for caste exchange all this amounts to little; later a
Brahmin might become a king, while the Ṛṣi in the Rigveda is
represented as speaking in a state of intoxication; the great
kings could be called sacrificers if, for the nonce, they were
consecrated ({%dīkṣita%}), and so temporarily became Brahmins.<sup>142</sup>
The hypothetical passages, too, do not help much. It would
be unwise to deny the possibility of caste exchange, but it is
not clearly indicated by any record. Even cases like that of
Satyakāma Jābāla do not go far; for {%ex hypothesi%} that teacher
[Page2-264+ 40]
did not know who his father was, and the latter could quite
well have been a Brahmin.
<div n="P"/>It may therefore be held that the priests and the nobles
practised hereditary occupations, and that either class was a
closed body into which a man must be born. These two
Varṇas may thus be fairly regarded as castes. The Vaiśyas
offer more difficulty, for they practised a great variety of
occupations (see {@Vaiśya@}). Fick<sup>143</sup> concludes that there is no
exact sense in which they can be called a caste, since, in the
Buddhist literature, they were divided into various groups,
which themselves practised endogamy such as the {%gahapatis,%} or
smaller landowners, the {%setthis,%} or large merchants and members
of the various guilds, while there are clear traces<sup>144</sup> in the legal
textbooks of a view that Brāhmaṇa and Kṣatriya stand opposed
to all the other members of the community. But we need
hardly accept this view for Vedic times, when the Vaiśya, the
ordinary freeman of the tribe, formed a class or caste in all
probability, which was severed by its free status from the
Śūdras, and which was severed by its lack of priestly or noble
blood from the two higher classes in the state. It is probably
legitimate to hold that any Vaiśya could marry any member of
the caste, and that the later divisions within the category of
Vaiśyas are growths of divisions parallel with the original
process by which priest and noble had grown into separate
entities. The process can be seen to day when new tribes fall
under the caste system: each class tries to elevate itself in the
social scale by refusing to intermarry with inferior classes on
equal terms — hypergamy is often allowed — and so those Vaiśyas
who acquired wealth in trade ({@Śreṣṭhin@}) or agriculture (the
Pāli Gahapatis) would become distinct, as sub-castes, from the
ordinary Vaiśyas. But it is not legitimate to regard Vaiśya as
a theoretic caste; rather it is an old caste which is in process
of dividing into innumerable sub-castes under influences of
occupation, religion, or geographical situation.
<div n="P"/>Fick<sup>145</sup> denies also that the Śūdras ever formed a single
[Page2-265+ 43]
caste: he regards the term as covering the numerous inferior
races and tribes defeated by the Āryan invaders, but originally
as denoting only one special tribe. It is reasonable to suppose
that Śūdra was the name given by the Vedic Indians to the
nations opposing them, and that these ranked as slaves beside
the three castes — nobles, priests, and people — just as in the
Anglo-Saxon and early German constitution beside the priests,
the {%nobiles%} or eorls, and the {%ingenui,%} ordinary freemen or ceorls,
there was a distinct class of slaves proper; the use of a generic
expression to cover them seems natural, whatever its origin (see
{@Śūdra@}). In the Āryan view a marriage of Śūdras could hardly
be regulated by rules; any Śūdra could wed another, if such a
marriage could be called a marriage at all, for a slave cannot in
early law be deemed to be capable of marriage proper. But
what applied in the early Vedic period became no doubt less
and less applicable later when many aboriginal tribes and
princes must have come into the Āryan community by peaceful
means, or by conquest, without loss of personal liberty, and
when the term Śūdra would cover many sorts of people who
were not really slaves, but were freemen of a humble character
occupied in such functions as supplying the numerous needs of
the village, like the {@Caṇḍālas,@} or tribes living under Āryan
control, or independent, such as the {@Niṣādas.@}
<div n="P"/>But it is also probable that the Śūdras came to include men
of Āryan race, and that the Vedic period saw the degradation
of Āryans to a lower social status. This seems, at any rate, to
have been the case with the {@Rathakāras.@} In the Taittirīya
Brāhmaṇa<sup>146</sup> the Rathakāra is placed as a special class along
with the Brāhmaṇas, Rājanyas, and Vaiśyas: this can hardly
be interpreted except to mean that the Rathakāras were not
included in the Āryan classes, though it is just possible that
only a subdivision of the Vaiśyas is meant. There is other
evidence<sup>147</sup> that the Rathakāras were regarded as Śūdras. But
in the Atharvaveda<sup>148</sup> the Rathakāras and the {@Karmāras@}
appear in a position of importance in connexion with the
[Page2-266+ 50]
selection of the king; these two classes are also referred to in
an honourable way in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā;<sup>149</sup> in the Śata-
patha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>150</sup> too, the Rathakāra is mentioned as a
a person of high standing. It is impossible to accept the view
suggested by Fick<sup>151</sup> that these classes were originally non-
Āryan; we must recognize that the Rathakāras, in early Vedic
times esteemed for their skill, later became degraded because of
the growth of the feeling that manual labour was not dignified.
The development of this idea was a departure from the Āryan
conception; it is not unnatural, however undesirable, and has
a faint parallel in the class distinctions of modern Europe.
Similarly, the Karmāra, the {@Takṣan,@}<sup>152</sup> the Carmamna, or
‘tanner,’ the weaver and others, quite dignified occupa-
tions in the Rigveda, are reckoned as Śūdras in the Pāli
texts.<sup>153</sup>
<div n="P"/>The later theory, which appears fully developed in the
Dharma Sūtras,<sup>154</sup> deduces the several castes other than the
original four from the intermarriage of the several castes. This
theory has no justification in the early Vedic literature. In
some cases it is obviously wrong; for example, the {@Sūta@} is said
to be a caste of this kind, whereas it is perfectly clear that if
the Sūtas did form a caste, it was one ultimately due to
occupation. But there is no evidence at all that the Sūtas,
Grāmaṇīs, and other members of occupations were real castes
in the sense that they were endogamic in the early Vedic
period. All that we can say is that there was a steady progress
by which caste after caste was formed, occupation being an
important determining feature, just as in modern times there
are castes bearing names like Gopāla (‘cowherd’) Kaivarta or
Dhīvara (‘fisherman’), and Vaṇij (‘merchant’).<sup>155</sup>
[Page2-267+ 39]
<div n="P"/>Fick<sup>156</sup> finds in the Jātakas mention of a number of occupa-
tions whose members did not form part of any caste at all, such
as the attendants on the court, the actors and dancers who
went from village to village, and the wild tribes that lived in
the mountains, fishermen, hunters, and so on. In Vedic times
these people presumably fell under the conception of Śūdra,
and may have included the {@Parṇaka, Paulkasa, Bainda,@} who
are mentioned with many others in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā
and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa in the list of victims at the
Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’). The slaves also, whom
Fick<sup>157</sup> includes in the same category, were certainly included
in the term Śūdra.
<div n="P"/>5. {%Origin of the Castes.%} — The question of the origin of the
castes presents some difficulty. The ultimate cause of the
extreme rigidity of the caste system, as compared with
the features of any other Āryan society, must probably be
sought in the sharp distinction drawn from the beginning
between the Āryan and the Śūdra. The contrast which the
Vedic Indians felt as existing between themselves and the
conquered population, and which probably rested originally on
the difference of colour between the upper and the lower
classes, tended to accentuate the natural distinctions of birth,
occupation, and locality which normally existed among the
Āryan Indians, but which among other Āryan peoples never
developed into a caste system like that of India. The doctrine
of hypergamy which marks the practical working of the caste
system, seems clearly to point to the feeling that the Āryan
could marry the Śūdrā, but not the Śūdra the Āryā. This
distinction probably lies at the back of all other divisions: its
force may be illustrated by the peculiar state of feeling as to
mixed marriages, for example, in the Southern States of
America and in South Africa, or even in India itself, between
the new invaders from Europe and the mingled population
which now peoples the country. Marriages between persons
of the white and the dark race are disapproved in principle, but
varying degrees of condemnation attach to (1) the marriage of
a man of the white race with a woman of the dark race;
[Page2-268+ 45]
(2) an informal connexion between these two; (3) a marriage
between a woman of the white race and a man of the dark
race; and (4) an informal connexion between these two. Each
category, on the whole, is subject to more severe reprobation
than the preceding one. This race element, it would seem, is
what has converted social divisions into castes. There appears,
then, to be a large element of truth in the theory, best repre-
sented by Risley,<sup>158</sup> which explains caste in the main as a
matter of blood, and which holds that the higher the caste is,
the greater is the proportion of Āryan blood.
<div n="P"/>The chief rival theory is undoubtedly that of Senart,<sup>159</sup>
which places the greatest stress on the Āryan constitution of
the family. According to Senart the Āryan people practised in
affairs of marriage both a rule of exogamy, and one of endogamy.
A man must marry a woman of equal birth, but not one of the
same {%gens,%} according to Roman law as interpreted by Senart
and Kovalevsky;<sup>160</sup> and an Athenian must marry an Athenian
woman, but not one of the same <lang n="greek">γένος</lang>. In India these rules
are reproduced in the form that one must not marry within
the {@Gotra,@} but not without the caste. The theory, though
attractively developed, is not convincing; the Latin and Greek
parallels are not even probably accurate;<sup>161</sup> and in India the
rule forbidding marriage within the Gotra is one which grows;
in strictness as the evidence grows later in date.<sup>162</sup>
<div n="P"/>On the other hand, it is not necessary to deny that the
development of caste may have been helped by the family
traditions of some {%gentes,%} or <lang n="greek">γένη</lang>, or Gotras. The Patricians
of Rome for a long time declined intermarriage with the
plebeians; the Athenian Eupatridai seem to have kept their
<lang n="greek">γένη</lang> pure from contamination by union with lower blood; and
there may well have been noble families among the Vedic
Indians who intermarried only among themselves. The
[Page2-269+ 49]
Germans known to Tacitus<sup>163</sup> were divided into {%nobiles%} and
{%ingenui,%} and the Anglo-Saxons into eorls and ceorls, noble
and non-noble freemen.<sup>164</sup> The origin of nobility need not be
sought in the Vedic period proper, for it may already have
existed. It may have been due to the fact that the king, whom
we must regard as originally elected by the people, was as king
often in close relation with, or regarded as an incarnation of,
the deity;<sup>165</sup> and that hereditary kingship would tend to
increase the tradition of especially sacred blood: thus the
royal family and its offshoots would be anxious to maintain
the purity of their blood. In India, beside the sanctity of the
king, there was the sanctity of the priest. Here we have in
the family exclusiveness of king and nobles, and the similar
exclusiveness of a priesthood which was not celibate, influences
that make for caste, especially when accompanying the deep
opposition between the general folk and the servile aborigines.
<div n="P"/>Caste, once created, naturally developed in different directions.
Nesfield<sup>166</sup> was inclined to see in occupation the one ground of
caste. It is hardly necessary seriously to criticize this view
considered as an ultimate explanation of caste, but it is perfectly
certain that gilds of workers tend to become castes. The
carpenters ({@Takṣan@}), the chariot-makers ({@Rathakāra@}), the fisher-
men ({@Dhaivara@}) and others are clearly of the type of caste, and
the number extends itself as time goes on. But this is not to
say that caste is founded on occupation pure and simple in its
first origin, or that mere difference of occupation would have
produced the system of caste without the interposition of the
fundamental difference between Āryan and Dāsa or Śūdra
blood and colour. This difference rendered increasingly impor-
tant what the history of the Āryan peoples shows us to be
declining, the distinction between the noble and the non-noble
[Page2-270+ 77]
freemen, a distinction not of course ultimate, but one which
seems to have been developed in the Āryan people before the
separation of its various branches.
<div n="P"/>It is well known that the Iranian polity presents a division
of classes comparable in some respects<sup>167</sup> with the Indian
polity. The priests (Atharvas) and warriors (Rathaesthas) are
unmistakably parallel, and the two lower classes seem to
correspond closely to the Pāli Gahapatis, and perhaps to the
Śūdras.<sup>168</sup> But they are certainly not castes in the Indian
sense of the word. There is no probability in the view of
Senart<sup>169</sup> or of Risley<sup>170</sup> that the names of the old classes were
later superimposed artificially on a system of castes that were
different from them in origin. We cannot say that the castes
existed before the classes, and that the classes were borrowed
by India from Iran, as Risley maintains, ignoring the early
Brāhmaṇa evidence for the four Varṇas, and treating the
transfer as late. Nor can we say with Senart that the castes
and classes are of independent origin. If there had been no
Varṇa, caste might never have arisen; both colour and class
occupation are needed for a plausible account of the rise of caste.<sup>171</sup>

The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa and the later
parts of the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, with
their traditions of Aśvamedhas, ‘horse
sacrifices,’ and their recollections of
the glories of the {@Bharatas,@} represent
a more advanced stage of social rela-
tions and of city life, but even they
hardly know really great kingdoms.</F>
<F>66) {%Indian Village Community%} and {%Village%}
{%Communities in India,%} where much stress
is laid on the idea of a settlement of
Āryans on lands already occupied by
Dravidian clans, much as Anglo-Saxon
invaders on one theory occupied lands
already held by Britons who became
serfs, while the invaders were a land-
holding aristocracy, a theory supported
by the fact that the normal holding of
a hide is estimated at 120 acres.</F>
<F>67) {%Cf.%} Hopkins, {%India, Old and New,%}
222. The point is much the same as that
at issue between the different schools of
opinion as to early English history.
Did the Āryans in India occupy the
land as a people, driving out or ex-
terminating or enslaving the Dāsas,
and themselves carrying on the occupa-
tions of a people, or did they merely
form a small aristocracy of superior
military force, and were the Kṣatriyas
the true Āryans? The evidence of the
Rigveda is really fatal to the latter
alternative hypothesis.</F>
<F>68) For the superiority of the Brāh-
maṇa to the Kṣatriya or Rājanya, see
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, xi. 11, 3; Vāja-
saneyi Saṃhitā, xxi. 21; Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa, v. 1, 1, 12; 4, 4, 15; xiii. 1,
9, 1; 3, 7, 8; Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,
vii. 15, 8; viii. 9, 6; Śāṅkhāyana
Śrauta Sūtra, xv. 20, 12. The Brāh-
maṇa is, in his turn, dependent on the
king (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 2, 3, 3;
v. 4, 2, 7), and at the Rājasūya sits
beside him, but is none the less superior
(Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, i. 2, 23).
The Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xxviii. 5, says
the Kṣatra is over the Brahman, but
this is not a usual view. {%Cf.%} xxvii. 4.
A Brāhmaṇa can get along without a
Kṣatriya, but not {%vice versa%} (Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa, iv. 1, 4, 6), and a Rājanya
with a Brāhmaṇa surpasses all other
Rājanyas (Taittirīya Saṃhitā, v. 1,
10, 3; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, xix. 10;
xxvii. 4, etc.).</F>

<F>70) Weber, {%op. cit.,%} 9, 326; 10, 14,
prefers ‘moving’ or ‘dwelling’ every-
where.</F>
<F>71) Muir, Haug, and Weber take the
word as active in sense, ‘moving at
will.’ But both the parallelism of the
passage and the formation of the word
require a passive causative sense. The
reference is perhaps to the general
political control of the king over the
priest, whom he can ‘move on’ from
place to place.</F>

great importance to the question of
eating together, and compares the sacri-
ficial meals of the {%gens%} at Rome, where
strangers were excluded (Fustel de
Coulanges, {%La Cité Antique,%} 117). But
this is not conclusive; a caste is not
a {%gens,%} and the {%gens%} excluded strangers
only at a solemn festival, when the
whole {%gens%} renewed its blood kinship.
If we have no evidence exactly estab-
lishing this for the Gotra in early Vedic
literature, we need not hesitate to
believe that in the earliest Vedic period
the Gotra had solemn festivals of union,
and of communication with the dead,
but that again does not explain or
amount to the caste prohibition of
taking food from an inferior.</F>
<F>84) {%E.g.,%} Aitareya Āraṇyaka, v. 3, 3.
with Keith's note.</F>
<F>85) For a case of objection to eating
food after another, see Chāndogya
Upaniṣad, i. 10, 1. Possibly the idea
there is that eating the food of a chief
is dangerous, since the eater thus enters
into possession of part of his sub-
stance, and consequently at once be-
comes an object of anger to the chief,
as well as of danger to himself; for the
chief may be so full of divine force that
it would be unsafe for an ordinary man
to be assimilated to him — a common
idea in primitive societies. See also
Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, v. 8, 13.</F>
<F>86) Fick, {%op. cit.,%} 24. Senart, {%op. cit.,%}
219, 220, compares the family councils
of Greece, Rome, and Germany (Leist,
{%Altarisches Jus Civile,%} 273 {%et seq.;%} Kova-
levsky, {%Famille et Propriété Primitives,%}
119; Fustel de Coulanges, {%op. cit.,%} 118,
119). But here again the system may
have applied to the Gotra without its
really explaining the later appearance
of the practice in the caste, and the
absence of the mention of a council in
the early and late literature alike is
conclusive against its existence.</F>

it can be interpreted to mean that the
Brāhmaṇa should be provided with a
temporary wife on each occasion when

this is hardly likely. Muir takes it as

<L>2843<pc>2-274<k1>vasizWa<k2>vasizWa
{@Vasiṣṭha@}¦ is the name of one of the most prominent priestly
figures of Vedic tradition. The seventh Maṇḍala of the
Rigveda is ascribed to him; this ascription is borne out by the
fact that the Vasiṣṭhas<sup>1</sup> and Vasiṣṭha<sup>2</sup> are frequently mentioned
in that Maṇḍala, besides being sometimes referred to elsewhere.
That by the name Vasiṣṭha a definite individual is always
meant is most improbable, as Oldenberg<sup>3</sup> shows; Vasiṣṭha
must normally mean simply ‘a Vasiṣṭha.’ But it is not
necessary to deny that a real Vasiṣṭha existed, for one hymn<sup>4</sup>
seems to show clear traces of his authorship, and of his assist-
ance to {@Sudās@} against the ten kings.
<div n="P"/>The most important feature of Vasiṣṭha's life was apparently
[Page2-275+ 68]
his hostility to {@Viśvāmitra.@} The latter was certainly<sup>5</sup> at one
time the {@Purohita@} (‘domestic priest’) of Sudās, but he seems
to have been deposed from that post, to have joined Sudās'
enemies, and to have taken part in the onslaught of the kings
against him, for the hymn of Sudās' triumph<sup>4</sup> has clear
references to the ruin Viśvāmitra brought on his allies.<sup>6</sup>
Oldenberg,<sup>7</sup> however, holds that the strife of Viśvāmitra and
Vasiṣṭha is not to be found in the Rigveda. On the other
hand, Geldner<sup>8</sup> is hardly right in finding in the Rigveda<sup>9</sup> a
compressed account indicating the rivalry of {@Śakti,@} Vasiṣṭha's
son, with Viśvāmitra, the acquisition by Viśvāmitra of special
skill in speech, and the revenge of Viśvāmitra, who secured the
death of Śakti by Sudās' servants, an account which is more
fully related by Ṣaḍguruśiṣya,<sup>10</sup> which appeared in the Śāṭyāya-
naka,<sup>11</sup> and to which reference seems to be made in the brief
notices of the Taittirīya Saṃhitā<sup>12</sup> and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāh-
maṇa<sup>13</sup> regarding Vasiṣṭha's sons having been slain, and his
overcoming the Saudāsas. But it is important to note that no
mention is made in these authorities of Sudās himself being
actually opposed to Vasiṣṭha, while in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>14</sup>
Vasiṣṭha appears as the Purohita and consecrator of Sudās
Paijavana. Yāska<sup>15</sup> recognizes Viśvāmitra as the Purohita of
Sudās; this accords with what seems to have been the fact
[Page2-276+ 63]
that Viśvāmitra originally held the post. Probably, however,
with the disappearance of Sudās, Viśvāmitra recovered his
position, whereupon Vasiṣṭha in revenge for the murder of
his sons secured in some way unspecified the defeat of the
Saudāsas.<sup>16</sup>
<div n="P"/>At any rate it is hardly necessary to suppose that the enmity
of the Saudāsas and Vasiṣṭhas was permanent. There is
evidence<sup>17</sup> that the Bharatas had the Vasiṣṭhas as Purohitas,
while other versions<sup>18</sup> regard them as Purohitas for people
({%prajāḥ%}) generally. It seems that the Vasiṣṭhas were pioneers
in adopting the rule that Purohitas should act as Brahman
priest<sup>19</sup> at the sacrifice: the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>20</sup> states that
the Vasiṣṭhas were once the only priests to act as Brahmans,
but that later any priest could serve as such.<sup>21</sup> A rivalry
with Jamadgni and Viśvāmitra is reported in the Taittirīya
Saṃhitā.<sup>22</sup> Parāśara and Śatayātu are associated with Vasiṣṭha
in the Rigveda,<sup>23</sup> being apparently, as Geldner<sup>24</sup> thinks, the
grandson and a son of Vasiṣṭha. According to Pischel,<sup>25</sup> in
another hymn,<sup>26</sup> Vasiṣṭha appears as attempting to steal the
goods of his father Varuṇa; Geldner<sup>27</sup> also shows that the
Rigveda<sup>28</sup> contains a clear reference to Vasiṣṭha's being a son
of Varuṇa and the nymph Urvaśī. Perhaps this explains the
fact that the Vasiṣṭhas are called the {@Tṛtsus@} in one passage
[Page2-277+ 52]
of the Rigveda;<sup>29</sup> for being of miraculous parentage, Vasiṣṭha
would need adoption into a Gotra, that of the princes whom
he served, and to whom Agastya seems to have introduced
him.
<div n="P"/>There are numerous other references to Vasiṣṭha as a Ṛṣi
in Vedic literature,<sup>30</sup> in the Sūtras,<sup>31</sup> and in the Epic, where
he and Viśvāmitra fight out their rivalry.<sup>32</sup>

{@Vāc,@}¦ ‘speech,’ plays a great part in Vedic speculation, but
only a few points are of other than mythological significance.
Speech is in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> divided into four kinds
-that of men, of animals, of birds ({%vayāṃsi%}), and of small
creeping things ({%kṣudraṃ sarīsṛpam%}). The discrimination or
making articulate of speech is ascribed to Indra by the
Saṃhitās.<sup>2</sup> The ‘speech’ of the following musical instruments
-{@Tūṇava, Vīṇā, Dundubhi@}<sup>3</sup> — is mentioned, and in one
Saṃhitā<sup>4</sup> also that of the axle of a chariot. The speech of the
{@Kuru-Pañcālas@} was especially renowned,<sup>5</sup> as well as that of the
northern country, according to the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa,<sup>6</sup> so
that men went there to study the language. On the other hand,
barbarisms in speech were known, and were to be avoided.<sup>7</sup>
[Page2-280+ 55]
<div n="P"/>One division of speech referred to<sup>8</sup> is that of the divine
({%daivī%}) and the human ({%mānuṣī%}), of which some specimens are
given, such as {%om,%} the divine counterpart of {%tathā,%} and so forth.
The Brahmin is said to know both;<sup>9</sup> it seems best to regard
the distinction not as between Sanskrit and Apabhraṃśa, as
Sāyaṇa<sup>10</sup> suggests, but as between the Sanskrit of the ritual
and the hymns and that of ordinary life.
<div n="P"/>Reference is also made to Āryan<sup>11</sup> and to Brahmin<sup>12</sup> speech,
by which Sanskrit, as opposed to non-Āryan tongues, seems to
be meant. The {@Vrātyas@} are described as speaking the language
of the initiated ({%dīkṣita-vāc%}), though not themselves initiated
({%a-dīkṣita%}), but as calling that which is easy to utter ({%a-durukta%}),
difficult to utter.<sup>13</sup> This may mean that the non-Brahminical
Indians were advancing more rapidly than the Brahminical
tribes to Prākrit speech, especially if it is legitimate to connect
the Vrātyas with the barbarians in speech alluded to in the
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>7</sup>

ferent accounts in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā,

The difficult phrase has caused some
doubt as to the sense, for {%uttarāhi vāg%}
{%vadati Kurupañcālatrā%} seems to mean
‘speech in the north among the Kuru-
Pañcālas,’ this version being slightly
supported by the Kāṇva recension of
the passage quoted by Eggeling, {%Sacred%}
{%Books of the East,%} 12, xlii. n. 1. That
recension, however, is not merely ob-
scure, but it seems to couple the Kurus
with the northern {@Mahāvṛṣas@} (so we
must emend {%Mahāviṣeṣu%}), and it cannot
be relied on. Eggeling's attempt to
remove the difficulty by taking {%uttarāhi%}
as ‘higher’ in tone is not satisfactory.
The most probable solution is that of
Weber, {%Indische Studien,%} 1, 191, who
takes {%Kurupañcālatrā%} to be ‘as among
the Kuru-Pañcālas,’ which gives a good
sense, especially when it is remembered
that the northerners were probably the
{@Uttara-Kurus@} in Kaśmīr, which seems
to have been a home of Sanskrit

<L>2857<pc>2-281<k1>vAjapeya<k2>vAjapeya
{@Vājapeya@}¦ is the name of a ceremony which, according to
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup> and later authorities,<sup>2</sup> is only per-
formed by a Brahmin or a Kṣatriya. The same Brāhmaṇa<sup>3</sup>
insists that this sacrifice is superior to the {@Rājasūya,@} but the
consensus of other authorities<sup>4</sup> assigns to it merely the place
of a preliminary to the {@Bṛhaspatisava@} in the case of a priest,
and to the {@Rājasūya@} in the case of a king, while the Śatapatha<sup>5</sup>
is compelled to identify the Bṛhaspatisava with the Vājapeya.
The essential ceremony is a chariot race in which the sacrificer
is victorious. There is evidence in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta
Sūtra<sup>6</sup> showing that once the festival was one which any
Āryan could perform. Hillebrandt,<sup>7</sup> indeed, goes so far as to
compare it with the Olympic games; but there is hardly much
real ground for this: the rite seems to have been developed

<L>2918<pc>2-291<k1>vAsas<k2>vAsas
{@Vāsas@}¦ is the most usual word in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later<sup>2</sup> for
‘clothing.’ Clothes were often woven of sheep's wool ({%cf.%}
{@Ūrṇā@}); the god Pūṣan is called a ‘weaver of garments’ ({%vāse-%}
{%vāya%})<sup>3</sup> because of his connexion with the fashioning of forms.
The garments worn were often embroidered ({%cf.%} {@Peśas@}), and
the Maruts are described as wearing mantles adorned with
gold.<sup>4</sup> When the ‘giver of garments’ ({%vāso-dā%})<sup>5</sup> is mentioned
along with the giver of horses and gold, ornamental garments are
probably meant. There are several references in the Rigveda<sup>6</sup>
to the Indians' love of ornament, which is attested by Megas-
[Page2-292+ 53]
thenes for his day.<sup>7</sup> The Rigveda also presents epithets like
{%su-vasana%}<sup>8</sup> and {%su-rabhi,%}<sup>9</sup> implying that garments were becoming
or well-fitting.
<div n="P"/>The Vedic Indian seems often to have worn three garments
-an undergarment ({%cf.%} {@Nīvi@}),<sup>10</sup> a garment,<sup>11</sup> and an over-
garment ({%cf.%} {@Adhīvāsa@}),<sup>12</sup> which was presumably a mantle, and
for which the names {@Atka@} and {@Drāpi@} also seem to be used.
This accords with the description of the sacrificial garments
given in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>13</sup> which comprise a {@Tārpya,@}
perhaps a ‘silken undergarment’; secondly, a garment of
undyed wool, and then a mantle, while the ends of the turban,
after being tied behind the neck, are brought forward and
tucked away in front. The last point would hardly accord
with the usual practice in ordinary life, but seems to be a
special sacrificial ritual act. A similar sort of garments in the
case of women appears to be alluded to in the Atharvaveda<sup>14</sup>
and the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa.<sup>15</sup> There is nothing to show
exactly what differences there were between male and female
costume, nor what was exactly the nature of the clothes in
either case.
<div n="P"/>It is important to note that the Vedic Indian evidently
assumed that all civilized persons other than inspired Munis
would wear clothing of some sort.<sup>16</sup>

{@Vidatha@}¦ is a word of obscure sense, confined mainly to the
Rigveda. According to Roth,<sup>1</sup> the sense is primarily ‘order,’
then the concrete body which gives orders, then ‘assembly’ for
secular<sup>2</sup> or religious ends,<sup>3</sup> or for war.<sup>4</sup> Oldenberg<sup>5</sup> once
thought that the main idea is ‘ordinance’ (from {%vi-dhā,%}
‘dispose,’ ‘ordain’), and thence ‘sacrifice.’ Ludwig<sup>6</sup> thinks
that the root idea is an ‘assembly,’ especially of the {@Maghavans@}
and the Brahmins. Geldner<sup>7</sup> considers that the word pri-
marily means ‘knowledge,’ ‘wisdom,’ ‘priestly lore,’ then
‘sacrifice’ and ‘spiritual authority.’ Bloomfield,<sup>8</sup> on the other
hand, insists that Vidatha refers to the ‘house’<sup>9</sup> in the first
place (from {%vid,%} ‘acquire’), and then to the ‘sacrifice,’ as
connected with the house; this interpretation, at any rate,
appears to suit all the passages. The term {%vidathya,%} once<sup>10</sup>
applied to the king ({%samrāṭ%}), might seem to be against this
view, but it may refer to his being ‘rich in homesteads’; and
the connexion of the woman with the Vidatha, as opposed to
[Page2-297+ 43]
the {@Sabhā,@} tells in favour<sup>11</sup> of Bloomfield's explanation. That
the word ever denotes an asylum, like the house of the

{@Videha@}¦ is the name of a people who are not mentioned
before the Brāhmaṇa period. In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>1</sup>
the legend of {@Videgha Māthava@} preserves clearly a tradition
that in Videha culture came from the Brahmins of the West,
and that {@Kosala@} was brahminized before Videha. The Videhas,
however, derived some fame later from the culture of their king
{@Janaka,@} who figures in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad<sup>2</sup> as one of
the leading patrons of the Brahman doctrine. In the Kauṣītaki
Upaniṣad<sup>3</sup> the Videhas are joined with the {@Kāśis;@} in the list of
peoples in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>4</sup> the Videhas are passed
over, probably because, with Kosala and Kāśi, they are included
in the term {@Prācyas,@} ‘easterners.’ Again, in the Śāṅkhāyana
Śrauta Sūtra<sup>5</sup> it is recorded that the Kāśi, Kosala, and Videha
kingdoms had each the one Purohita, {@Jala Jātūkarṇya;@} and
in another passage of the same text<sup>6</sup> the connexion between
the Videha king, {@Para Āṭṇāra,@} and the Kosala king, {@Hiraṇya-@}
{@nābha,@} is explained, while the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>7</sup> speaks of
Para Āṭṇāra as the Kosala king, descendant of Hiraṇyanābha.
<div n="P"/>Another king of Videha was {@Namī Sāpya,@} mentioned in the
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.<sup>8</sup> In the Saṃhitās of the Yajurveda<sup>9</sup>
‘cows of Videha’ seem to be alluded to, though the com-
mentator on the Taittirīya Saṃhitā merely takes the adjective
{%vaidehī%} as ‘having a splendid body’ ({%viśiṣṭa-deha-sambandhinī%}),
and the point of a place name in the expression is not very
obvious. The Videhas also occur in the Baudhāyana Śrauta
Sūtra<sup>10</sup> in Brāhmaṇa-like passages.
<div n="P"/>The boundary of Kosala and Videha was the {@Sadānīrā,@}

<L>2979<pc>2-305<k1>viS<k2>viS
{@Viś@}¦ is an expression of somewhat doubtful significance. In
many passages of the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> the sense of ‘settlement’ or
‘dwelling’ is adequate and probable, since the root {%viś%} means
to ‘enter’ or ‘settle.’ In other passages, where the Viśaḥ
[Page2-306+ 64]
stand in relation to a prince, the term must mean ‘subject’;<sup>2</sup>
so, for example, when the people of {@Tṛṇaskanda@}<sup>3</sup> or of the
{@Tṛtsus@} are mentioned.<sup>4</sup> Again, in some passages<sup>5</sup> the general
sense of ‘people’ is adequate; as when the Rigveda speaks of
the ‘Āryan people,’<sup>6</sup> or the ‘divine people,’<sup>7</sup> or the ‘Dāsa
people,’ and so on.<sup>8</sup>
<div n="P"/>Sometimes,<sup>9</sup> however, the Viś appear in a more special sense
as a subdivision of the {@Jana@} or whole people. This is, how-
ever, not common, for in most passages one or other of the
senses given above is quite possible. Moreover, it is very
difficult to decide whether the Viś as a subdivision of the Jana
is to be considered as being a local subdivision (canton) or a
blood kinship equivalent to a clan in the large sense of the
word, while the relation of the Viś to the {@Grāma@} or to the
{@Gotra@} is quite uncertain. In one passage of the Atharvaveda<sup>10</sup>
the Viśaḥ are mentioned along with the {%sabandhavaḥ%} or relatives,
but no definite conclusion can be drawn from that fact. Nor
does the analogy of the Roman {%curia%} or the Greek <lang n="greek">φρήτρη</lang> throw
much light, as these institutions are themselves of obscure
character, and the parallelism need not be cogent. It is, at
any rate, possible that the Viś may in some cases have been no
more than a Gotra or clan, or different clans may sometimes
[Page2-307+ 72]
have made up a Viś, while Grāma is more definitely, perhaps, a
local designation. But the Vedic evidence is quite inconclusive.<sup>11</sup>
{%Cf.%} {@Viśpati.@}
<div n="P"/>In the later period the sense of Viś is definitely restricted in
some cases<sup>12</sup> to denote the third of the classes of the Vedic
polity, the people or clansmen as opposed to the nobles ({@Kṣatra,@}

<F>11) The Viś may have been originally
a clan settled in one place: there is
no passage where ‘Gotra’ would not
probably make sense; Rv. ii. 26, 3,
cannot be pressed unduly to distinguish
{%ianman%} and Viś. Compare the phrase
used of the Maruts {%śardhaṃ śardham,%}
{%vrātaṃ vrātam, gaṇaṃ gaṇam,%} in Rv.
v. 53. 11, where no precise sense can
fairly be attributed to the words, though
Zimmer sees in them a threefold division
of the host corresponding to Jana, Viś,
and Grāma. The rendering ‘Gau’ has
therefore little foundation.</F>
<F>12) Perhaps to this sense belong the
numerous passages in the Brāhmaṇas
and later Saṃhitās referring to strife
between the Viś and the Kṣatra, the
clansmen and the chiefs, or the

{@Viś-pati@}¦ is a word of somewhat uncertain signification,
reflecting in this respect the nature of {@Viś.@} Zimmer holds that
in its strict sense it denotes the head of a canton, but he admits
that there is no passage requiring this sense, the only one
quoted by him<sup>2</sup> being certainly indecisive. In the great
majority of passages the word simply means the ‘lord of the
dwelling,’ whether used of a man or of the god Agni as the
householder {%par excellence,%} or possibly as the fire of the {@Sabhā@} or
assembly house of the people. This sense suits even the
passage of the Rigveda<sup>4</sup> in which the Viśpati, as well as the
father and the mother of a maiden,<sup>5</sup> are to be lulled to sleep in
order to allow her lover to approach her, for the household may
well be deemed to have been a joint family, in which the
Viśpati could easily be different from the father of the
girl — {%e.g.,%} a grandfather or uncle. In other passages<sup>6</sup> the
Viśpati is the king as ‘lord of the subject-people’ ({%viśām%}),
though here Zimmer<sup>7</sup> thinks reference is made to the election
of a king.<sup>8</sup> Or again,<sup>7</sup> the Viśpati is the chief of the Viś,

{@Viśvā-mitra@}¦ (‘friend of all’) is the name of a Ṛṣi who is
mentioned in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> and to whom the third Maṇḍala is
attributed by tradition. In one hymn<sup>2</sup> which appears to be his
own composition, he praises the rivers {@Vipāś@} (Beas) and
{@Śutudrī@} (Sutlej). There he calls himself the son of {@Kuśika,@}
and seems unquestionably to be the helper of the {@Bharatas,@}
whom he mentions. The tribe, engaged in a raid, apparently
came to the rivers from the east.<sup>4</sup> Anxious to cross them, they
<div n="P"/>^3 Rv. iii. 33, 5.
[Page2-311+ 57]
found them in high flood, but Viśvāmitra by prayer induced
the waters to subside. The same feat appears to be referred
to in another passage of the same book of the Rigveda.<sup>5</sup>
Curiously enough, Sāyaṇa<sup>6</sup> quite misunderstands the situation:
according to him, Viśvāmitra having obtained wealth by the
exercise of his office, went off with it to the rivers, pur-
sued by others. Yāska's<sup>7</sup> version of the tale merely seems
to mean that the king paid Viśvāmitra to act as his {@Puro-@}
{@hita,@} or domestic priest. For the relations of Viśvāmitra
to Vasiṣṭha connected with their service of {@Sudās, see@}
{@Vasiṣṭha.@}
<div n="P"/>The Viśvāmitras are mentioned in several other passages of
the Rigveda,<sup>8</sup> and are also designated as a family by the term
{@Kuśikas.@}<sup>9</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the later literature Viśvāmitra becomes, like Vasiṣṭha, a
mythical sage, usually<sup>10</sup> mentioned in connection with {@Jamad-@}
{@agni;@} he was Hotṛ priest at the sacrifice of {@Śunaḥśepa,@} whom
he adopted, and to whom he gave the name of {@Devarāta.@}<sup>11</sup> He
was a protégé of Indra, with whom he had an interview
according to the Rigveda Āraṇyakas.<sup>12</sup> He is also often
mentioned as a Ṛṣi.<sup>13</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Epic<sup>14</sup> Viśvāmitra is represented as a king, who
becomes a Brahmin. There is no trace of his kingship in the
Rigveda, but the Nirukta<sup>15</sup> calls his father, Kuśika, a king; the
[Page2-312+ 52]
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>16</sup> refers to Śunaḥśepa as succeeding to
the lordship of the {@Jahnus,@} as well as the ‘divine lore’ ({%daiva%}
{%veda%}) of the {@Gāthins;@} and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>17</sup>
mentions Viśvāmitra as a king. But there is no real-trace of
this kingship of Viśvāmitra: it may probably be dismissed as a
mere legend, with no more foundation at most than that Viśvā-
mitra was of a family which once had been royal. But even
this is doubtful.

{@Vaira@}¦<sup>1</sup> and {@Vaira-deya@}<sup>2</sup> seem to have in the later Saṃhitās
and the Brāhmaṇas the definite and technical sense of ‘wergeld,’
the money to be paid for killing a man as a compensation to
his relatives. This view is borne out by the Sūtras of Āpa-
stamba<sup>3</sup> and Baudhāyana.<sup>4</sup> Both prescribe the scale of
1,000 cows for a {@Kṣatriya,@}<sup>5</sup> 100 for a {@Vaiśya,@} 10 for a {@Śūdra,@}
and a bull over and above in each case. Āpastamba leaves the
destination of the payment vague, but Baudhāyana assigns it
to the king. It is reasonable to suppose that the cows were
intended for the relations, and the bull was a present to the
king for his intervention to induce the injured relatives to
abandon the demand for the life of the offender. The Āpa-
stamba Sūtra<sup>6</sup> allows the same scale of wergeld for women, but
the Gautama Sūtra<sup>7</sup> puts them on a level with men of the
Śūdra caste only, except in one special case. The payment is
made for the purpose of {%vaira-yātana%} or {%vaira-niryātana,%} ‘requital
of enmity,’ ‘expiation.’
<div n="P"/>The Rigveda<sup>8</sup> preserves, also, the important notice that a
man's wergeld was a hundred (cows), for it contains the epithet
{%śata-dāya,%} ‘one whose wergeld is a hundred.’ No doubt the
values varied, but in the case of {@Śunaḥśepa@} the amount is a
hundred (cows) in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>9</sup> In the Yajurveda
Saṃhitās<sup>10</sup> {%śata-dāya%} again appears.
[Page2-332+ 37]
<div n="P"/>The fixing of the price shows that already public opinion, and
perhaps the royal authority, was in Rigvedic times diminishing
the sphere of private revenge; on the other hand, the existence
of the system shows how weak was the criminal authority of
the king ({%cf.%} {@Dharma@}).

{@Vaiśya@}¦ denotes a man, not so much of the people, as of the
subject class, distinct from the ruling noble ({@Kṣatriya@}) and the
{@Brāhmaṇa,@} the higher strata of the Āryan community on the
one side, and from the aboriginal {@Śūdra@} on the other. The
name is first found in the Puruṣa-sūkta (‘hymn of man’) in
the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> and then frequently from the Atharvaveda<sup>2</sup>
onwards,<sup>3</sup> sometimes in the form of Viśya.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Vaiśya plays singularly little part in Vedic literature,
which has much to say of Kṣatriya and Brahmin. His
characteristics are admirably summed up in the Aitareya Brāh-
maṇa<sup>5</sup> in the adjectives {%anyasya bali-kṛt,%} ‘tributary to another’;
{%anyasyādya,%} ‘to be lived upon by another’; and {%yathākāma-%}
{%jyeyaḥ,%} ‘to be oppressed at will.’ He was unquestionably taxed
by the king ({@Rājan@}), who no doubt assigned to his retinue the
right of support by the people, so that the Kṣatriyas grew more
and more to depend on the services rendered to them by the
Vaiśyas. But the Vaiśya was not a slave: he could not be
killed by the king or anyone else without the slayer incurring
risk and the payment of a wergeld ({@Vaira@}), which even in the
Brahmin books extends to 100 cows for a Vaiśya. Moreover,
though the Vaiśya could be expelled by the king at pleasure, he
cannot be said to have been without property in his land.
Hopkins<sup>6</sup> thinks it is absurd to suppose that he could really be
a landowner when he was subject to removal at will, but this
is to ignore the fact that normally the king could not remove
the landowner, and that kings were ultimately dependent on
the people, as the tales of exiled kings show.
<div n="P"/>On the other hand, Hopkins<sup>7</sup> is clearly right in holding that
the Vaiśya was really an agriculturist, and that Vedic society
was not merely a landholding aristocracy, superimposed upon
an agricultural aboriginal stock, as Baden Powell<sup>8</sup> urged.
Without ignoring the possibility that the Dravidians were
agriculturists, there is no reason to deny that the Āryans were
[Page2-334+ 44]
so likewise, and the goad of the plougher was the mark of a
Vaiśya in life<sup>9</sup> and in death.<sup>10</sup> It would be absurd to suppose
that the Āryan Vaiśyas did not engage in industry and com-
merce ({%cf.%} {@Paṇi, Vaṇij@}), but pastoral pursuits and agriculture
must have been their normal occupations.
<div n="P"/>In war the Vaiśyas must have formed the bulk of the force
under the Kṣatriya leaders (see {@Kṣatriya@}). But like the
Homeric commoners, the Vaiśyas may well have done little of
the serious fighting, being probably ill-provided with either
body armour or offensive weapons.
<div n="P"/>That the Vaiśyas were engaged in the intellectual life of the
day is unlikely; nor is there any tradition, corresponding to
that regarding the Kṣatriyas, of their having taken part in the
evolution of the doctrine of Brahman, the great philosophic
achievement of the age. The aim of the Vaiśya's ambition
was, according to the Taittirīya Saṃhitā,<sup>11</sup> to become a
{@Grāmaṇī,@} or village headman, a post probably conferred by the
king on wealthy Vaiśyas, of whom no doubt there were many.
It is impossible to say if in Vedic times a Vaiśya could attain to
nobility or become a Brahmin. No instance can safely be
quoted in support of such a view,<sup>12</sup> though such changes of
status may have taken place (see {@Kṣatriya@} and {@Varṇa@}).
<div n="P"/>It is denied by Fick<sup>13</sup> that the Vaiśyas were ever a caste, and
the denial is certainly based on good grounds if it is held that
a caste means a body within which marriage is essential, and
which follows a hereditary occupation ({%cf.%} {@Varṇa@}). But it
would be wrong<sup>14</sup> to suppose that the term Vaiśya was merely
applied by theorists to the people who were not nobles or
priests. It must have been an early appellation of a definite
class which was separate from the other classes, and properly
to be compared with them. Moreover, though there were
differences among Vaiśyas, there were equally differences
among Kṣatriyas and Brāhmanas, and it is impossible to deny
[Page2-335+ 41]
the Vaiśyas' claim to be reckoned a class or caste it the other
two are such, though at the present day things are different.

{@Vyādhi,@}¦ ‘disease,’ occurs several times in Vedic literature.<sup>1</sup>
The specific diseases are dealt with under the separate names,
but the Vedic texts also mention innumerable bodily defects.
The list of victims<sup>2</sup> at the Puruṣamedha (‘human sacrifice’)
includes a ‘dwarf’ ({%vāmana, kubja%}), a ‘bald’ person ({%khalati%}),<sup>3</sup> a
‘blind’ man ({%andha%}),<sup>4</sup> a ‘deaf’ man ({%badhira%}),<sup>5</sup> a ‘dumb’ man
({%mūka%}),<sup>6</sup> a ‘fat’ man ({%pīvan%}), a ‘leper’ ({%sidhmala, kilāsa%}),<sup>7</sup> a
‘yellow-eyed’ man ({%hary-akṣa%}), a ‘tawny-eyed’ man ({%piṅg-%}
{%ākṣa%}), a ‘cripple’ ({%pīṭha-sarpin%}), a ‘lame’ man ({%srāma%}), a
‘sleepless’ man ({%jāgaraṇa%}), a ‘sleepy’ man ({%svapana%}), one<sup>8</sup> ‘too
tall’ ({%ati-dīrgha%}), one ‘too short’ ({%ati-hrasva%}), one ‘too stout’
({%ati-sthāla%} or {%aty-aṃsala%}), one ‘too thin’ ({%ati-kṛśa%}), one ‘too
white’ ({%ati-śukla%}), one ‘too dark’ ({%ati-kṛṣṇa%}), one ‘too bald’
({%ati-kulva%}), and one ‘too hairy’ ({%ati-lomaśa%}).
<div n="P"/>In the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā<sup>9</sup> the man with bad nails and the
man with brown teeth are mentioned along with sinners like
the {@Didhiṣūpati.@} The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>10</sup> mentions a
‘white-spotted ({%śukla%}), bald-headed man, with projecting teeth
({%viklidha%}) and reddish-brown eyes.’ Interesting is Zimmer's<sup>11</sup>
suggestion that {%kirmira%} found in the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>12</sup>
means ‘spotty’ as an intermixture of races, but it is only a
conjecture, apparently based on a supposed connexion of the
word with {%kṛ,%} ‘mix.’ In the Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>13</sup> and the
[Page2-339+ 57]
Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa<sup>14</sup> various epithets are applied to women,
some of which seem to denote disease, and in the Atharvaveda<sup>15</sup>
the feminine adjectives, ‘antelope-footed’ ({%ṛśya-padī%}) and ‘bull-
toothed’ ({%vṛṣa-datī%}), probably refer to bodily defects.

only thence the ‘herd’; for the Vraja does not normally mean
an ‘enclosure’ at all: the Vedic cattle were not stall-fed as a

{@Vrātya@}¦ is included in the list of victims at the Puruṣamedha
(‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda,<sup>1</sup> where, however, no
further explanation of the name is given. Fuller information
is furnished by the Atharvaveda,<sup>2</sup> the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>3</sup>
and the Sūtras.<sup>4</sup> which describe at length a certain rite intended
for the use of Vrātyas. According to the Pañcaviṃśa Brāh-
maṇa, there are four different kinds of ‘outcasts’ — viz., the
{%hīna,%} who are merely described as ‘depressed’; those who have
become outcasts for some sin ({%nindita%}); those who become out-
casts at an early age, apparently by living among outcasts; and
those old men who, being impotent ({%śama-nīcameḍhra%}), have
gone to live with outcasts. The last three categories are by no
means of the same importance as the first. The motive of
the fourth is hard to understand: according to Rājārām Rām-
[Page2-343+ 41]
krishṇa Bhāgavat,<sup>5</sup> they were men who had enfeebled their
constitutions by undue intercourse with women in the lands of
the outcasts, and returned home in a debilitated state. But
this is not stated in the text.
<div n="P"/>It seems probable that the really important Vrātyas were
those referred to as {%hīna,%} and that the other classes were only
subsidiary. According to Rājārām,<sup>6</sup> there were two categories
of the first class: ({%a%}) The depressed ({%hīna%}), who were non-
Āryan; and ({%b%}) degraded Āryans ({%gara-gir%}). This, however, is
a mere guess, and devoid of probability. There seems to have
been but one class of Vrātyas. That they were non-Āryan is
not probable, for it is expressly said<sup>7</sup> that, though unconse-
crated, they spoke the tongue of the consecrated: they were
thus apparently Āryans. This view is confirmed by the state-
ment that ‘they call what is easy of utterance, difficult to
utter’: probable they and already a somewhat Prakritic form of
speech ({%cf.%} {@Vāc@}). The Sūtras mention their Arhants (‘saints’)
and Yaudhas (‘warrioes’), corresponding to the Brahminical
Brāhmaṇa and Kṣatriya.
<div n="P"/>Other particulars accord with the view that they were
Āryans outside the sphere of Brahmin culture. Thus they
are said<sup>8</sup> not to practise agriculture or commerce (an
allusion to a nomadic life), not to observe the rules of
{@Brahmacarya@} — {%i.e.,%} the principle regulating the Brahminic
order of life. They were also allowed to become members
of the Brahminical community by performance of the ritual
prescribed, which would hardly be so natural in the case
of non-Āryans.
<div n="P"/>Some details are given of the life and dress of the Vrātyas.
Their principles were opposed to those of the Brahmins: they
beat those unworthy of correction.<sup>9</sup> Their leder (Gṛhapati) or
householder wore a turban ({@Uṣṇīṣa@}), carried a whip ({@Pratoda@}),
a kind of bow ({@Jyāhroḍa@}), was clothed in a black ({%kṛṣṇaśa%})
garment and two skins ({@Ajina@}), black and white ({%kṛṣṇa-valakṣa%}),
and owned a rough wagon ({@Vipatha@}) covered with planks
[Page2-344+ 51]
({%phalakāstīrṇa%}). The others,<sup>10</sup> subordinate to the leader, had
garments with fringes of red ({%valūkāntāni dāmatūṣāṇi%}), two
fringes on each, skins folded double ({%dviṣaṃhitāny ajināni%}), and
sandals ({@Upānah@}). The leader wore also an ornament ({@Niṣka@})
of silver, which Rājārām<sup>11</sup> converts into a silver coinage. The
Vrātyas, on becoming consecrated, were expected to hand over
their goods to the priest. Many other details are given in the
Sūtras ({%e.g.,%} that the shoes or sandals were of variegated black
hue and pointed), but these are not authenticated by the
Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa.
<div n="P"/>The locality in which the Vrātyas lived cannot be stated with
certainty, but their nomad life<sup>12</sup> suggests the western tribes
beyond the Sarasvatī. But they may equally well have been in
the east: this possibility is so far supported by the fact that the
Sūtras make the Brahmin receiving the gift of the Vrātya's
outfit an inhabitant of {@Magadha.@} The Atharvaveda<sup>13</sup> does not
help, for it treats the Vrātya in so mystical a way that he is
represented as being in all the quarters. Indeed, Roth<sup>14</sup>
believed that it was here not a case of the Vrātya of the Pañca-
viṃśa Brāhmaṇa at all, but of a glorification of the Vrātya as
the type of the pious vagrant or wandering religious mendicant
({@Parivrājaka@}). This view is clearly wrong, as the occurrence
of the words {%uṣṇīsa, vipatha,%} and {%pratoaa%} shows. It is probable
that the 15th Book of the Atharvaveda, which deals with the
Vrātya, and is of a mystical character, exalts the converted
Vrātya as a type of the perfect {@Brahmicārin,@} and, in so far, of
the divinity.<sup>15</sup>

interpret the expression as ‘lord of a hundred gods,’ as does
the commentary on the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, is obviously
impossible. It seems clear that there is a reference to an
analogous human functionary — viz., the lord of a hundred
villages, known in the later law<sup>3</sup> — who was probably at once a
judicial deputy of the sovereign and a revenue collector, an
ancient magistrate and collector.

<div n="P"/>It is impossible to say with certainty whether Śambara was
a real person or not. Hillebrandt<sup>9</sup> is strongly in favour of the
theory that he was a real chief as enemy of Divodāsa: he
relies on the statistics<sup>10</sup> of the mention of the name to show
that, where as he was conceived as a real foe in the hymns of
the time of Divodāsa, later texts, like those of the seventh
Maṇḍala, make him into a demon, as a result of the change of
scene from Arachosia to India. As a matter of fact, apart from
this theory, Śambara was quite possibly an aboriginal enemy
in India, living in the mountains.<sup>11</sup>

{@Śarīra,@}¦ ‘body,’ is a word of frequent occurrence in Vedic
literature.<sup>1</sup> The interest of the Vedic Indians seems early to
have been attracted to the consideration of questions connected
with the anatomy of the body. Thus a hymn of the Atharva-
veda<sup>2</sup> enumerates many parts of the body with some approach
to accuracy and orderly arrangement.<sup>3</sup> It mentions the heels
({%pārṣṇī%}), the flesh ({%māṃsa%}), the ankle-bones ({%gulphau%}), the
fingers ({%aṅgulīḥ%}), the apertures ({%kha%}), the two metatarsi
({%uchlakau%}), the tarsus ({%pratiṣṭhā%}), the two knee-caps ({%aṣṭhī-%}
{%vantau%}), the two legs ({%jaṅghe%}), the two knee-joints ({%jānunoḥ%}
{%sandhī%}). Then comes above the two kness ({%jānū%}) the four-
sided ({%catuṣṭaya%}), pliant ({%śithira%}) trunk ({%kabandha%}). The two
hips ({%śroṇī%}) and the two thighs ({%ārū%}) are the props of the frame
[Page2-359+ 61]
({%kusindha%}). Next come the breast-bone ({%uras%}), the cervical
cartilages ({%grīvāḥ%}), the two breast pieces ({%stanau%}), the two
shoulder-blades ({%kaphoḍau%}), the neck-bones ({%skandhau%}), and the
backbones ({%pṛṣṭīḥ%}), the collar-bones ({%aṃsau%}), the arms ({%bāhū%}),
the seven apertures in the head ({%sapta khāni śīrṣaṇi%}), the ears
({%karṇau%}), the nostrils ({%nāsike%}), the eyes ({%cakṣaṇī%}), the mouth
({%mukha%}), the jaws ({%hanū%}), the tongue ({%jihvā%}), the brain ({%mas-%}
{%tiṣka%}), the forehead ({%lalāṭa%}), the facial bone ({%kakāṭikā%}), the
cranium ({%kapāla%}), and the structure of the jaws ({%cityā hanvoḥ%}).
<div n="P"/>This system presents marked similarities with the later
system of Caraka and Suśruta,<sup>4</sup> which render certain the names
ascribed to the several terms by Hoernle. {%Kaphoḍau,%} which is
variously read in the manuscripts,<sup>5</sup> is rendered ‘collar-bone’ by
Whitney, but ‘elbow’ in the St. Petersburg Dictionary.
{%Skandha%} in the plural regularly<sup>6</sup> denotes ‘neck-bones,’ or, more
precisely, ‘cervical vertebræ,’ a part denoted also by {%uṣṇihā%} in
the plural.<sup>7</sup> {%Pṛṣṭī%}<sup>8</sup> denotes not ‘rib,’ which is {%parśu,%}<sup>9</sup> but a
transverse process of a vertebra, and so the vertebra itself,
there being in the truncal portion of the spinal column seventeen
vertebræ and thirty-four transverse processes. The vertebræ
are also denoted by {%kīkasā%} in the plural,<sup>10</sup> which sometimes<sup>11</sup> is
limited to the upper portion of the vertebral column, sometimes<sup>12</sup>
to the thoracic portion of the spine. {%Anūka%} also denotes the
vertebral column,<sup>13</sup> or more specially the lumbar<sup>14</sup> or thoracic<sup>15</sup>
portion of the spine; it is said in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>15</sup>
[Page2-360+ 55]
that there are twenty transverse processes in the lumbar spine
({%udara%}) and thirty-two in the thoracic, which gives twenty-six
vertebræ, the true number (but the modern division is seven
cervical, twelve thoracic, five lumbar, and two false — the
sacrum and the coccyx). The vertebral column is also denoted
by {%karūkara,%}<sup>16</sup> which, however, is usually found in the plural<sup>17</sup>
denoting the transverse processes of the vertebræ, a sense
expressed also by {%kuntāpa.%}<sup>18</sup>
<div n="P"/>{%Grīvā,%} in the plural, denotes cervical vertebræ, the number
seven being given by the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>19</sup> but usually<sup>20</sup>
the word simply means windpipe, or, more accurately, the
cartilaginous rings under the skin. {@Jatru,@} also in the plural,
denotes the cervical cartilages,<sup>21</sup> or possibly the costal carti-
lages, which are certainly so called in the Śatapatha Brāh-
maṇa,<sup>22</sup> where their number is given as eight.
<div n="P"/>{%Bhaṃsas,%} which occurs thrice in the Atharvaveda,<sup>23</sup> seems to
denote the pubic bone or arch rather than the ‘buttocks’ or
‘fundament,’ as Whitney<sup>24</sup> takes it.
<div n="P"/>In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa<sup>25</sup> the number of bones in the
the human body is given as 360. The number of the bones
of the head and trunk are given in another passage<sup>26</sup> as
follows: The head is threefold, consisting of skin ({%tvac%}), bone
({%asthi%}), brain ({%matiṣka%}); the neck has 15 bones: 14 transverse
processes ({%karūkara%}) and the strength ({%vīrya%}) — {%i.e.,%} the bone of
the centre regarded as one — as the 15th; the breast has 17:
16 cervical cartilages ({%jatru%}), and the sternum ({%uras%}) as the
17th; the abdominal portion of the spine has 21: 20 trans-
[Page2-361+ 45]
verse processes ({%kuntāpa%}), and the abdominal portion ({%udara%}) as
the 21st; the two sides have 27: 26 ribs ({%parśu%}), and the two
sides as the 27th; the thoracic portion of the spine ({%anūka%})
has 33: 32 transverse processes, and the thoracic portion
as 33rd.
<div n="P"/>There are several enumerations of the parts of the body, not
merely of the skeleton, in the Yajurveda Saṃhitās.<sup>27</sup> They
include the hair ({%lomāni%}), skin ({%tvac%}), flesh ({%māṃsa%}), bone
({%asthi%}), marrow ({%majjan%}), liver ({%yakṛt%}), lungs ({%kloman%}), kidneys
({%matasne%}), gall ({%pitta%}), entrails ({%āntrāṇi%}), bowels ({%gudāḥ%}), spleen
({%plīhan%}), navel ({%nābhi%}), belly ({%udara%}), rectum ({%vaniṣṭhu%}), womb
({%yoni%}), penis ({%plāśi%} and {%śepa%}), face ({%mukha%}), head ({%śiras%}),
tongue ({%jihvā%}), mouth ({%āsan%}), rump ({%pāyu%}), leech ({%vāla%}), eye
({%cakṣus%}), eyelashes ({%pakṣmāṇi%}), eyebrows ({%utāni%}), nose ({%nas%}), breath
({%vyāna%}), nose-hairs ({%nasyāni%}), ears ({%karṇau%}), brows ({%bhrū%}), body
or trunk ({%ātman%}), waist ({%upastha%}), hair on the face ({%śmaśrūṇi%}),
and on the head ({%keśāḥ%}). Another enumeration<sup>28</sup> gives {%śiras,%}
{%mukha, keśāḥ, śmaśrūṇi, prāṇa%} (breath), {%cakṣus, śrotra%} (ear), {%jihvā,%}
{%vāc%} (speech), {%manas%} (mind), {%aṅgulīḥ, aṅgāni%} (limbs), {%bāhū, hastau%}
(hands), {%karṇau, ātmā, uras%} (sternum), {%pṛṣṭīḥ%} (vertebræ), {%udara,%}
{%aṃsau, grīvāḥ, śroṇī, ūrū, aratnī%} (elbows), {%jānūni, nābhi, pāyu,%}
{%bhasat%} (fundament), {%āṇḍau%} (testicles), {%pasas%} (membrum virile),
{%jaṅghā, pad%} (foot), {%lomāni, tvac, māṃsa, asthi, majjan.%} Another
set of names<sup>29</sup> includes {%vaniṣṭhu, purītat%} (pericardium), {%lomāni,%}
{%tvac, lohita%} (blood), {%medas%} (fat), {%māṃsāni, snāvāni%} (sinews),
{%asthīni, majjānaḥ, retas%} (semen), {%pāyu, kośya%} (flesh near the
heart), {%pārśvya%} (intercostal flesh), etc.
<div n="P"/>The bones of the skeleton of the horse are enumerated in the
Yajurveda Saṃhitās.<sup>30</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Aitareya Āraṇyaka<sup>31</sup> the human body is regarded as
made up of one hundred and one items; there are four parts,
[Page2-362+ 61]
each of twenty-five members, with the trunk as one hundred
and first. In the two upper parts there are five four-jointed<sup>32</sup>
fingers, two {%kakṣasī%} (of uncertain meaning),<sup>33</sup> the arm ({%dos%}), the
collar-bone ({%akṣa%}), and the shoulder-blade ({%aṃsa-phalaka%}). In
the two lower portions there are five four-jointed toes, the
thigh, the leg, and three articulations, according to Sāyaṇa's
commentary.
<div n="P"/>The Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka<sup>34</sup> enumerates three bones in the
head,<sup>35</sup> three joints ({%parvāṇi%}) in the neck,<sup>36</sup> the collar-bone
({%akṣa%}),<sup>37</sup> three joints in the fingers,<sup>38</sup> and twenty-one transverse
processes in the spine ({%anūka%}).<sup>39</sup> The Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā<sup>40</sup>
enumerates four constituents in the head ({%prāṇa, cakṣus, śrotra,%}
{%vāc%}), but there are many variations, the number going up to
twelve on one calculation.<sup>41</sup> In the Taittirīya Upaniṣad<sup>42</sup> an
enumeration is given consisting of {%carma%} (skin), {%māṃsa, snāvan,%}
{%asthi,%} and {%majjan;%} and the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>43</sup> has {%lomāni, māṃsa,%}
{%tvac, asthi, majjan,%} and the Aitareya Āraṇyaka<sup>44</sup> couples {%majjānaḥ,%}
{%snāvāni,%} and {%asthīni.%} Other terms relating to the body are
{%kaṅkūṣa,%}<sup>45</sup> perhaps a part of the ear,<sup>46</sup> {%yoni%} (female organ),
{%kakṣa%}<sup>47</sup> (armpit), {@Danta@} (tooth), {%nakha%} (nail), {%prapada%}<sup>48</sup> (forepart
of the foot), {%halīkṣṇa%}<sup>49</sup> (gall).

{@Śaryaṇāvant@}¦ occurs in several passages of the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> in
all of which Sāyaṇa sees a local name. According to his
account, Śaryaṇāḥ (masc. plur.) is a district in {@Kurukṣetra,@}
Śaryaṇāvant being a lake not far from it in the back part
({%jaghanārdhe%}) of Kurukṣetra. The unusual consistency of his
statements on this point is in favour of the word being a place
name; it is also to be noted that Kurukṣetra contained the
lake {@Anyataḥplakṣā.@} Roth,<sup>2</sup> however, thought that in two
passages<sup>3</sup> the word denoted merely a ‘lake,’ literally ‘(water)
covered with a thicket of reeds’ ({%śaryaṇa%}), and in the others a
Soma vessel. Zimmer<sup>4</sup> inclines to this rendering. On the
other hand, Pischel<sup>5</sup> accepts Sāyaṇa's view. Hillebrandt<sup>6</sup> also
sees in the word a place name, but he is inclined to locate it
among the ‘five tribes,’<sup>7</sup> which is not quite inconsistent with its
being in Kurukṣetra, for the connexion of the {@Pūrus@} with the
later {@Kurus@} is known;<sup>8</sup> or perhaps, he suggests, Śaryaṇāvant

through his supplications, supposed to be preserved in certain
hymns of the Rigveda.<sup>3</sup> He was adopted by {@Viśvāmitra,@} to
whose advice he owed the inspiration to ask the gods to release
him, and became his son as {@Devarāta,@} much to the annoyance
[Page2-386+ 44]
of some of Viśvāmitra's sons, who in consequence were cursed
by their father. The Rigveda, however, contains merely the
statement of Śunaḥśepa's deliverance from peril of death by
the divine help, and the Yajurvedas<sup>4</sup> simply say that he was
seized by Varuṇa (perhaps with dropsy),<sup>5</sup> but saved himself from
Varuṇa's bonds.

<L>3323<pc>2-388<k1>SUdra<k2>SUdra
{@Śūdra@}¦ is the designation of the fourth caste in the Vedic
state (see {@Varṇa@}). It is quite unknown in the Rigveda except
in the Puruṣasūkta<sup>1</sup> (‘hymn of man’) in the tenth Maṇḍla,
where is the earliest version of the origin of the castes the
Śudra for the first time appears. The Rigveda, on the other
hand, knows {@Dasyu@} and {@Dāsa,@} both as aborigines independent
of Āryan control and as subjugated slaves: it is reasonable to
reckon the Śūdra of the later texts as belonging to the
aborigines who had been reduced to subjection by the Āryans.
Strictly speaking, the defeated aborigines must have been
regarded as slaves, but it is obvious that, except on occasions
when most of the men were slain, which may have occurred
quite often, there must have remained too many of them to be
used as slaves of individual owners. The villages of the
aborigines must have continued to subsist, but under Āryan
lordship and control: there may be this amount of truth in
Baden Powell's theory, which practically traced all the early
cultivating villages in India to Dravidian origin. On the other
hand, the term Śūdra would also cover the wild hill tribes
which lived by hunting and fishing, and many of which would
acknowledge the superiority of their Āryan neighbours: it
could, in fact, be applied to all beyond the pale of the Āryan
state.
<div n="P"/>This view of the Śūdra suits adequately the Vedic references
to his condition, which would not apply adequately to domestic
slaves only. The Śūdra is continually opposed to the Āryan,<sup>2</sup>
and the colour of the Śūdra is compared with that of the
Āryan,<sup>3</sup> just as his ways are so contrasted.<sup>4</sup> The Aitareya
Brāhmaṇa,<sup>5</sup> in its account of the castes, declares that the
[Page2-389+ 53]
Śūdra is {%anyasya preṣya,%} ‘the servant of another’; {%kāmotthāpya,%}
‘to be expelled at will’; and {%yathākāmavadhya,%} ‘to be slain at
will.’ All these terms well enough describe the position of the
serf as the result of a conquest: the epithets might have been
applied to the English serf after the Norman Conquest with
but slight inaccuracy, especially if his master had received a
grant of jurisdiction from the Crown. The Pañcaviṃśa Brāh-
maṇa<sup>6</sup> explains that even if prosperous ({%bahu-paśu,%} ‘having
many cows’) a Śūdra could not be other than a servant: his
business was {%pādāvanejya,%} ‘the washing of the feet’ of his
superiors. The Mahābhārata<sup>7</sup> says out and out that a Śūdra
has no property ({%na hi svam asti śūdrasya,%} ‘the Śūdra has
nothing he can call his own’). On the other hand, just as in
England the royal justice would protect the serf in life and
limb,<sup>8</sup> so it appears that the slaying of a Śūdra involved a
wergeld of ten cows according to both Baudhāyana<sup>9</sup> and
Āpastamba.<sup>10</sup> It may, indeed, be held that this wergeld was
only due in case of murder by another than the master, but
such limitation is nowhere stated.
<div n="P"/>In sacred matters the distinction between Āryan and {@Śūdra@}
was, of course, specially marked. The texts<sup>11</sup> do not hesitate
to declare that the upper castes were ‘all,’ ignoring the Śūdras;
the Śūdra is prohibited<sup>12</sup> from milking the cow for the milk
required at the Agnihotra (‘oblation to Agni’); and the Śata-
patha Brāhmaṇa<sup>13</sup> forbids a man who has been consecrated
({%dīkṣita%}) for a sacrifice to speak to a Śūdra at all for the time,
though the Śāṭyāyanaka<sup>14</sup> seems to have relaxed this rule by
confining it to cases in which the Śūdra was guilty of some sin.
[Page2-390+ 62]
At the sacrifice itself the Śūdra could not be present in the
{%śālā,%} ‘hall’; he is definitely classed in the Śatapatha Brāh-
máṇa<sup>15</sup> and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>16</sup> as unfit for ‘sacrifice’
({%ayajñiya%}); and declared in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>17</sup> not to be
admitted to drink Soma. At the Pravargya (introductory
Soma) rite the performer is not allowed to come in contact
with a Śūdra,<sup>18</sup> who here, as in the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā,<sup>17</sup> is
reckoned as excluded from a share in the Soma-draught. On
the other hand, the Śūdra is one of the victims at the Puruṣa-
medha (‘human sacrifice’) in the Yajurveda,<sup>19</sup> and a fight
between an Āryan and a Śūdra, in which, of course, the former
wins, forms a part of the Mahāvrata rite, being perhaps a pre-
cursor of the Indian drama.<sup>20</sup>
<div n="P"/>Other indications, however, exist, showing that it would be
undesirable to ignore the real importance of the Śūdra, which
again reminds us of the condition of the serf, who, though
legally restrained, still gradually won his way to the rank of a
free man. Rich Śūdras are mentioned in the early texts,<sup>21</sup> just
as Śūdra {%gahapatis,%} ‘householders,’ occur in the Buddhist texts,
and Śūdra kings in the legal literature.<sup>22</sup> Sin against Śūdra and
Āryan is mentioned;<sup>23</sup> prayers for glory on behalf of Śūdras,
as well as of the other castes<sup>24</sup> occur; and the desire to be dear
to Śūdra as well as to Āryan is expressed.<sup>25</sup>
[Page2-391+ 71]
<div n="P"/>The Sūtras also, while they emphasize as general rules
points earlier not insisted on, such as their inferiority in
sitting, etc.,<sup>26</sup> their exclusion from the study of the Vedas,<sup>27</sup>
the danger of contact with them<sup>28</sup> or their food,<sup>29</sup> still recog-
nize that Śūdras can be merchants,<sup>30</sup> or even exercise any
trade.<sup>31</sup>
<div n="P"/>Moreover, the Sūtras<sup>32</sup> permit the marriage of a Śūdrā
woman with members of all castes. Though it was a reproach
to {@Vatsa@}<sup>33</sup> and to {@Kavaṣa@}<sup>34</sup> that they were the sons of a Śūdrā
and a Dāsī respectively, still the possibility of such a reproach
shows that marriages of this kind did take place. Moreover,
illicit unions of Ārya and Śūdrā, or Śūdra and Āryā, are
referred to in the Saṃhitās of the Yajurveda.<sup>35</sup>
<div n="P"/>The origin of the term Śūdra is quite obscure, but Zimmer<sup>36</sup>
points out that Ptolemy<sup>37</sup> mentions <lang n="greek">Σύδροι</lang> as a people, and he
thinks that the Brāhui may be meant. Without laying any
stress on this identification,<sup>38</sup> it is reasonable to accept the
[Page2-392+ 53]
view<sup>39</sup> that the term was originally the name of a large tribe
opposed to the Āryan invasion. See also {@Niṣāda.@}

It is suggested ({%ibid.,%} 1, 382) that they
represent the original Dravidian type,
which in India has been merged in the
Muṇḍā type; but this suggestion is
invalidated by the fact that the Rigveda
speaks of the Dasyus as {%anās,%} ‘nose-
less’ ({%cf.%} {@Dasyu,@} 1, 347, n. 7). a term
admirably applicable to Dravidians,
but ludicrous as applied to the Turco-
Iranian type. It is much more plausible
to assume that the Brāhuis are a mixed
race, which in course of time has lost
most of its Dravidian features. On
the relation of Dravidians and speakers
of Muṇḍā tongues, the Vedic texts
throw no light.</F>

<L>3368<pc>2-400<k1>SyAvASva<k2>SyAvASva
{@Śyāvāśva@}¦ is the name of a man mentioned several times in
the Rigveda.<sup>1</sup> The Anukramaṇī (Index) assigns to him a
series of hymns in the fifth, eight, and ninth books.<sup>2</sup> In one
of the hymns<sup>3</sup> Śyāvāśva mentions, apparently as his patrons,
{@Taranta@} (a son of {@Vidadaśva@}) and {@Purumīlha,@} as well as
{@Rathavīti.@} On this hymn is based a legend found in the
Bṛhaddevatā,<sup>4</sup> that he was the son of {@Arcanānas,@} who was
sacrificing for Rathavīti Dālbhya. The father was anxious to
obtain the king's daughter for his son in marriage; but though
the father was willing, his wife insisted on her son-in-law being
a Ṛṣi. The father and son, repulsed, were returning home,
when they met on the way Taranta and Purumīḍha, former
patrons of the father. These showed him respect, while
Taranta's wife, Śaśīyasī, presented Śyāvāśva with much wealth.
The son was then fortunate enough to meet the Maruts in the
forest, and praised them, thus becoming a seer. As a result
the king himself ultimately offered his daughter to Śyāvāśva.
Sieg<sup>5</sup> seeks to show that this legend is presupposed in the Rigveda;
but it is difficult to accept this view, since the references in the
Rigveda are very obscure, and Śaśīyasī is probably no more
than an epithet.<sup>6</sup> That there is some Itihāsa at the back of the
hymn is clear: what it is can hardly now be determined.
<div n="P"/>Śyāvāśva's obtaining gifts from Vaidadaśvi is referred to also
in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra.<sup>7</sup> His name occurs in the
Atharvaveda<sup>8</sup> in two lists of persons, of which the former
includes Purumīḍha, the latter also Arcanānas and Atri. A
Sāman is ascribed to him in the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>9</sup> and
he is perhaps referred to in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka.<sup>10</sup> In the
[Page2-401+ 58]
Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra and the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>11</sup> he
is styled Ārcanānasa, ‘son of Arcanānas,’ and later<sup>12</sup> he is called
Ātreya, ‘descendant of Atri.’

{@Śveta-ketu@}¦ Aruṇeya<sup>1</sup> (‘descendant of {@Aruṇa@}’) or {@Auddālaki@}<sup>2</sup>
(‘son of {@Uddālaka@}’) is mentioned repeatedly in the Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa and the Chāndogya Upaniṣad. In the Kauṣītaki
Upaniṣad<sup>3</sup> he appears as Śvetaketu, son of {@Āruṇi,@} and as a
{@Gautama.@} In the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa<sup>4</sup> he is quoted as an
authority on the vexed question of the duty of the {@Sadasya,@} or
the seventeenth priest, at the ritual of the Kauṣītakins, to
notify errors in the sacrifice; Āruṇi, his father, is also cited.
He was a person of some originality, for he insisted on eating
honey despite the general prohibition of the use of that
delicacy by Brahmacārins or religious students.<sup>5</sup> He was a
contemporary of, and was instructed by the {@Pañcāla@} king
{@Pravāhaṇa Jaivala.@}<sup>6</sup> He was also a contemporary of {@Janaka,@}
of {@Videha,@} and figured among the Brahmin disputants at his
court.<sup>7</sup> A story is told of him in the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta
Sūtra:<sup>8</sup> {@Jala Jātūkarṇya@} was lucky enough to become the
Purohita of three peoples or kings, of {@Kāśi, Kosala,@} and
{@Videha.@} Seeing this, Śvetaketu felt annoyed and reproached
his father with his excessive devotion to sacrifice, which merely
enriched and glorified others, not himself. His father replied,
forbidding him to speak thus: he had learned the true method
of sacrificing, and his ambition in life had been to discuss it
with every Brahmin.
<div n="P"/>All the references to Śvetaketu belong to the latest period of
Vedic literature. It is, therefore, not surprising that the Āpa-
stamba Dharma Sūtra<sup>9</sup> should refer to him as an Avara, or
[Page2-410+ 47]
person of later days, who still became a Ṛṣi by special merit.
His date, however, must not be fixed too low, because the
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa in which he plays so marked a part is
certainly earlier than Pāṇini, and was apparently even in that
grammarian's time believed to be an ancient work: hence
500 B.C. is probably rather too late than too early a period for
Śvetaketu as a rough approximation to a date.<sup>10</sup>

{@Saṃ-vatsara,@}¦ ‘year,’ is repeatedly mentioned from the
Rigveda onwards.<sup>1</sup>
<div n="P"/>It duration was, according to the concurrent evidence of
the Saṃhitās and Brāhmaṇas, 360 days, divided into 12 months,
being, no doubt, roughly a lunar synodic year, which, however,
it exceeded in length by 6 days.<sup>2</sup> As a solar year it appears
only in the Nidāna Sūtra<sup>3</sup> of the Sāmaveda, where the sun is
stated to spend 13(1/3) days in each of the 27 Nakṣatras.
[Page2-412+ 53]
<div n="P"/>The year being obviously out of harmony with the solar year
(whether sidereal or tropical), efforts were certainly made to
effect an assimilation of the natural and the accepted year. As
has been seen (see {@Māsa@}), the evidence goes strongly to show
that the intercalation was not an easy matter in the Brāh-
maṇa period, though there are traces of what may be re-
garded as a five-yearly or six-yearly intercalation. But there
is no conclusive evidence that these periods were really
observed.
<div n="P"/>Zimmer,<sup>4</sup> indeed, considers that the evidence required is
afforded by the lists of the years, which are sometimes
enumerated as five: Saṃvatsara, Parivatsara, Idāvatsara,
Idvatsara, and Vatsara;<sup>5</sup> or Saṃvatsara, Parivatsara, Idāvat-
sara, Iduvatsara, Vatsara;<sup>6</sup> or Saṃvatsara, Idāvatsara, Iduvat-
sara, Idvatsara, Vatsara;<sup>7</sup> or Saṃvatsara, Parivatsara, Idāvat-
sara, Anuvatsara, Udvatsara;<sup>8</sup> or Saṃvatsara, Parivatsara,
Idāvatsara, Anuvatsara, Idvatsara.<sup>9</sup> But it must be noted not
merely that the names vary considerably, but that four only are
mentioned in some places,<sup>10</sup> in others<sup>11</sup> three, in others<sup>12</sup> two,
and in yet others<sup>13</sup> six. Moreover, in none of these enumera-
tions is there any reference to the names being connected with
a system of intercalation. It is most probable that here we
have no more that a mere series of priestly variations of
Vatsara, based on the older and more genuine Saṃvatsara and
Parivatsara as variants of the simple Vatsara, ‘year.’ The key
to the invention of the series is probably to be found in
passages like that of the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,<sup>14</sup> where the
several {@Cāturmāsya@} (‘four-monthly’) sacrifices are equated
[Page2-413+ 54]
with the different years.<sup>15</sup> Particularly unjustifiable is the
attempt of Zimmer to see in the two-year series a series of two
years of 354 days each, with an intercalary month in the
second; for the year of 354 days, as such, is not known to have
existed before the Sūtra period.
<div n="P"/>Zimmer<sup>16</sup> also finds an attempt at intercalation in the
famous 12 days in which the Ṛbhus are said to have slept in
the house of Agohya.<sup>17</sup> He thinks that they represent twelve
days added at the winter solstice to equate the lunar year of
354 days and the solar year of 366 days; and from the rever-
ence paid in German antiquity to the ‘12 nights,’ he infers
that this mode of intercalation is Indo-Germanic.<sup>18</sup> There can
be little doubt that this view is wrong, and that the 12 days are
merely the ‘reflexion of the year’ ({%saṃvatsarasya pratimā%})<sup>19</sup> in
the sense that they represent the twelve months, and have no
relation to chronology at all.
<div n="P"/>A reference to the use of Saṃvatsara alone as the fifth year
of the cycle is seen by Shamasastry<sup>20</sup> in the peculiar dating of
certain notices in the Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra,<sup>21</sup> but this view
is improbable.<sup>22</sup>

{@Saṃ-grāma@}¦ denotes primarily, it seems, ‘assembly’ either in
peace<sup>1</sup> or in war,<sup>2</sup> when it means an ‘armed band.’ Its normal
sense in the Atharvaveda<sup>3</sup> and later<sup>4</sup> is ‘war,’ ‘battle.’
[Page2-417+ 50]
<div n="P"/>Little is known of Vedic warfare, but it seems to have been
simple. A body of foot soldiers with charioteers composed
every army, the two going together,<sup>5</sup> and the foot soldiers being
often overthrown by the charioteers,<sup>6</sup> who were doubtless
the Kṣatriyas and their foremost retainers. Probably the
foot soldiers bore little armour, and used only the bow for
offence, as is suggested by the account that Herodotus gives of
the Indian contingent of the army with which Xerxes invaded
Greece.<sup>7</sup> The nobles, on the other hand, may have had cuirass
({@Varman@}), helmet ({@Śiprā@}), and hand-guard ({@Hastaghna@}) as a
protection from the friction of the bowstring. On the car was
the charioteer, and on his left the warrior ({@Sārathi, Savyaṣṭhā@}).
Riding is never mentioned in war,<sup>8</sup> and would hardly have
been suited to Vedic ideas, for the warrior mainly depended on
his bow, which he could not have used effectively from horse-
back. The offensive weapon ({@Āyudha@}) was practically the
bow; spear and sword and axe were very seldom used.
<div n="P"/>Whether there was a strict tribal organization of the host,
such as is once alluded to in the Homeric poems,<sup>9</sup> and is also
recognized in Germany by Tacitus,<sup>10</sup> is uncertain ({%cf.%} {@Vrāta@}),
but in the Epic relations ({@Jñāti@}) fight together,<sup>11</sup> and this rule,
no doubt, applied more or less in Vedic times also.
<div n="P"/>Cities were besieged and invested ({%upa-sad, pra-bhid%}),<sup>12</sup>
probably as a rule by blockade, since the ineffective means of
assault of the time would have rendered storming difficult and
expensive. Hillebrandt<sup>13</sup> thinks that the {%pur cariṣṇū%} of the
Rigveda<sup>14</sup> was a kind of chariot; it may — like the Trojan
horse — have been an Indian anticipation of the Roman means
of assaulting a town.
<div n="P"/>Besides ordinary wars of defence and conquest, raids into
[Page2-418+ 50]
neighbouring territory seem to have been frequent and normal,<sup>15</sup>
no doubt because of the booty ({@Udāja, Nirāja@}) which was to be
won, and which the king had to share with the people.
<div n="P"/>Banners ({@Dhvaja@}) were borne in war, and musical instru-
ments ({@Dundubhi, Bakura@})<sup>16</sup> were used by the combatants.

{@Sabhā@}¦ is the name of an ‘assembly’ of the Vedic Indians as
well as of the ‘hall’ where they met in assembly. It is often
mentioned in the Rigveda<sup>1</sup> and later,<sup>2</sup> but its exact character is
not certain. The hall was clearly used for dicing,<sup>3</sup> presumably
when the assembly was not transacting public business: a
dicer is called {%sabhā-sthāṇu,%} ‘pillar of the assembly hall,’ doubt-
less because of his constant presence there.<sup>4</sup> The hall also
served, like the Homeric <lang n="greek">λέσχη</lang>, as a meeting-place for social
intercourse and general conversation about cows and so forth,<sup>5</sup>
possibly for debates and verbal contests.<sup>6</sup>
<div n="P"/>According to Ludwig,<sup>7</sup> the Sabhā was an assembly not of all
the people, but of the Brahmins and {@Maghavans@} (‘rich
patrons’). This view can be supported by the expressions
[Page2-427+ 62]
{%sabheya,%} ‘worthy of the assembly,’ applied to a Brahmin,<sup>8</sup> {%rayiḥ%}
{%sabhāvān,%} ‘wealth fitting for the assembly,’<sup>9</sup> and so on. But
Bloomfield<sup>10</sup> plausibly sees in these passages a domestic use of
Sabhā, which is recognized by the St. Petersburg Dictionary
in several passages<sup>11</sup> as relating to a house, not to the assembly
at all. Zimmer<sup>12</sup> is satisfied that the Sabhā was the meeting-
place of the village council, presided over by the {@Grāmaṇī.@}
But of this there is no trace whatever. Hillebrandt<sup>13</sup> seems
right in maintaining that the Sabhā and the {@Samiti@} cannot be
distinguished, and that the reference to well-born ({%su-jāta%})<sup>14</sup>
men being there in session is to the Āryan as opposed to the
Dāsa or Śūdra, not to one class of Āryan as opposed to the
other. Hillebrandt also sees in Agni ‘of the hall’ ({%sabhya%}) a
trace of the fire used in sacrifice on behalf of the assembly
when it met.<sup>15</sup>
<div n="P"/>Women did not go to the Sabhā,<sup>16</sup> for they were, of course,
excluded from political activity. For the Sabhā as a court-

other primarily the place of assembly.<sup>6</sup>

were essential for his prosperity.<sup>9</sup>

frequent word in the Rigveda and later. It is of importance in
[Page2-432+ 60]
so far as it indicates that the Vedic Indians knew the sea.
This is, indeed, denied by Vivien de Saint Martin,<sup>1</sup> but not
only do Max Müller<sup>2</sup> and Lassen<sup>3</sup> assert it, but even Zimmer,<sup>4</sup>
who is inclined to restrict their knowledge of the sea as far as
possible, admits it in one passage of the Rigveda,<sup>5</sup> and of
course later.<sup>6</sup> He points out that the ebb and flow of the sea
are unknown, that the mouths of the Indus are never men-
tioned, that fish is not a known diet in the Rigveda ({%cf.%} {@Matsya@}),
and that in many places Samudra is metaphorically used, as of
the two oceans,<sup>7</sup> the lower and the upper oceans,<sup>8</sup> etc. In
other passages he thinks that Samudra denotes the river Indus
when it receives all its Panjab tributaries.<sup>9</sup> It is probable that
this is to circumscribe too narrowly the Vedic knowledge of the
ocean, which was almost inevitable to people who knew the
Indus. There are references to the treasures of the ocean,<sup>10</sup>
perhaps pearls or the gains of trade,<sup>11</sup> and the story of {@Bhujyu@}
seems to allude to marine navigation.

cannot be proved: the stress Iaid<sup>12</sup> on the occurrence in the

and ‘peacock,’ is invalidated by the doubtful date of the Book
of Kings. There is, besides, little reason to assume an early
date for the trade that no doubt developed later, perhaps
about 700 B.C.<sup>14</sup>

<L>3502<pc>2-434<k1>sarasvatI<k2>sarasvatI
{@Sarasvatī@}¦<sup>1</sup> is the name of a river frequently mentioned in
the Rigveda and later. In many passages<sup>2</sup> of the later texts it
is certain the river meant is the modern Sarasvatī, which loses
[Page2-435+ 70]
itself in the sands of Patiala (see {@Vinaśana@}). Even Roth<sup>3</sup>
admits that this river is intended in some passages of the
Rigveda. With the {@Dṛṣadvatī@}<sup>4</sup> it formed the western boundary
of Brahmāvarta (see {@Madhyadeśa@}). It is the holy stream of
early Vedic India. The Sūtras<sup>5</sup> mention sacrifices held on its
banks as of great importance and sanctity.
<div n="P"/>In many other passages of the Rigveda,<sup>6</sup> and even later,<sup>7</sup>
Roth held that another river, the {@Sindhu@} (Indus), was really
meant: only thus could it be explained why the Sarasvatī is
called the ‘foremost of rivers’ ({%nadītamā%}),<sup>8</sup> is said to go to the
ocean,<sup>9</sup> and is referred to as a large river, on the banks of which
many kings,<sup>10</sup> and, indeed, the five tribes, were located.<sup>11</sup>
This view is accepted by Zimmer<sup>12</sup> and others.<sup>13</sup>
<div n="P"/>On the other hand, Lassen<sup>14</sup> and Max Müller<sup>15</sup> maintain the
identity of the Vedic Sarasvatī with the later Sarasvatī.<sup>16</sup> The
latter is of opinion that in Vedic times the Sarasvatī was as
large a stream as the Sutlej, and that it actually reached the
[Page2-436+ 51]
sea either after union with the Indus or not, being the ‘iron
citadel,’ as the last boundary on the west, a frontier of the
Panjab against the rest of India. There is no conclusive
evidence of there having been any great change in the size or
course of the Sarasvatī, though it would be impossible to deny
that the river may easily have diminished in size. But there
are strong reasons to accept the identification of the later and
the earlier Sarasvatī throughout. The insistence on the divine
character of the river is been in the very hymn<sup>17</sup> which refers
to it as the support of the five tribes, and corresponds well with
its later sacredness. Moreover, that hymn alludes to the
{@Pārāvatas,@} a people shown by the later evidence of the Pañca-
viṃśa Brāhmaṇa<sup>18</sup> to have been in the east, a very long way
from their original home, if Sarasvatī means the Indus. Again,
the {@Pūrus,@} who were settled on the Sarasvatī,<sup>19</sup> could with great
difficulty be located in the far west. Moreover, the five tribes
might easily be held to be on the Sarasvatī, when they were, as
they seem to have been, the western neighbours of the {@Bharatas@}
in {@Kurukṣetra,@} and the Sarasvatī could easily be regarded
as the boundary of the Panjab in that sense. Again, the
‘seven rivers’ in one passage<sup>20</sup> clearly designate a district: it
is most probable that they are not the five rivers with the
Indus and the {@Kubhā@} (Cabul river), but the five rivers, the
Indus and the Sarasvatī. Nor is it difficult to see why the river
is said to flow to the sea: either the Vedic poet had never
followed the course of the river to its end, or the river did
actually penetrate the desert either completely or for a long
distance, and only in the Brāhmaṇa period was its disappear-
[Page2-437+ 50]
ance in the desert found out. It is said, indeed, in the
Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā<sup>21</sup> that the five rivers go to the Sarasvatī,
but this passage is not only late (as the use of the word {@Deśa@}
shows), but it does not say that the five rivers meant are those
of the Panjab. Moreover, the passage has neither a parallel
in the other Saṃhitās, nor can it possibly be regarded as an
early production; if it is late it must refer to the later
Sarasvatī.
<div n="P"/>Hillebrandt,<sup>22</sup> on the whole, adopts this view of the Saras-
vatī,<sup>23</sup> but he also sees in it, besides the designation of a
mythical stream, the later Vaitaraṇī,<sup>24</sup> as well as the name of the
Arghandab in Arachosia.<sup>25</sup> This opinion depends essentially
on his theory that the sixth Maṇḍala of the Rigveda places the
scene of its action in Iranian lands, as opposed to the seventh
Maṇḍala: it is as untenable as that theory itself.<sup>26</sup> Brunn-
hofer<sup>27</sup> at one time accepted the Iranian identification, but
later<sup>28</sup> decided for the Oxus, which is quite out of the question.

Gaṅgā, Yamunā, Sarasvatī, Śutudrī,
the Sarasvatī comes between the Jumna
and the Sutlej, the position of the
modern Sarsūti (Saraswatī), which,
flowing to the west of Thanesar, is
joined in Patiala territory by a more
westerly stream, the Ghaggar, and,
passing Sirsa, is lost in the desert at
Bhatnair; but a dry river bed (Hakra
or Ghaggar) can be traced from that
point to the Indus. See {%Imperial Gasetteer%}

of Sarasvatī and the seven rivers is
rather vague. In Rv. viii. 54, 4, Saras-
vatī and the seven rivers are separately
invoked, and in vi. 61, 10, 12, she is
referred to as ‘seven-sistered’ ({%sapta-%}
{%svasā%}). In vii. 36, 6, she is called the
‘seventh,’ which makes the Sarasvatī
one of the rivers. If the former passages
are to be treated as precise, then {%sapta-%}
{%svasā%} may be considered to show that
the Sarasvatī was outside the river
system (which would then be Indus,
Kubhā, and the five rivers of the
Panjab; see {@Sapta Sindhavaḥ@}); but
the expression may be loosely meant
for one of seven sisters.</F>

simply Manu with a patronymic derived from an unknown

agreed in seeing in him the ‘charioteer’ ({@Sārathi@}) or ‘master of

that he was, in the Brāhmaṇas at least, a minstrel and court
poet, while Weber<sup>9</sup> considers that his name denotes him as
‘consecrated’ — that is, one who has constant access to the

bard:<sup>10</sup> it may be that the curious words {%ahanti,%}<sup>11</sup> {%ahantya,%}<sup>12</sup> or

{@Sūrya,@}¦ the ‘sun,’ plays a great part in Vedic mythology and
religion,<sup>1</sup> corresponding with the importance of the sun as a
factor in the physical life of the peninsula. In the Rigveda<sup>2</sup>
the sun is normally regarded as a beneficent power, a not
unnatural view in a people which must apparently have issued
from the cold regions of the Himālaya mountains. Its heat
is, however, alluded to in some passages of the Rigveda,<sup>3</sup> as
well as referred to in the Atharvaveda and the literature of the
Brāhmaṇas.<sup>4</sup>
<div n="P"/>In one myth Indra is said to have vanquished Sūrya and to
have stolen his wheel:<sup>5</sup> this is possibly a reference to the
[Page2-466+ 62]
obscuration of the sun by a thunderstorm.<sup>6</sup> The Aitareya
Brāhmaṇa<sup>7</sup> presents a naive conception of the course of the
sun, which it regards as bright on one side only, and as
returning from west to east by the same road, but with the
reverse side turned towards the earth, thus at night illumining
the stars in heaven.<sup>8</sup> In the Rigveda<sup>9</sup> wonder is expressed
that the sun does not fall.
<div n="P"/>There are several references to eclipses in the Rigveda. In
one passage<sup>10</sup> Svarbhānu, a demon, is said to have eclipsed the
sun with darkness, while {@Atri@} restores the light of the sun, a
similar feat being elsewhere attributed to his family, the Atris.<sup>11</sup>
In the Atharvaveda<sup>12</sup> {@Rāhu@} appears for the first time in con-
nexion with the sun. Indra's defeat of Sūrya<sup>6</sup> may also be
explained as alluding to an eclipse; in two other passages<sup>13</sup>
such an interpretation seems at least probable. Ludwig<sup>14</sup> not
only argues that the Rigveda knows the theory of eclipses
caused by an occultation of the sun by the moon, and regards
the sun as going round the earth,<sup>15</sup> but even endeavours to
identify an eclipse referred to in the Rigveda with one that
occurred in 1029 B.C. These views are completely refuted by
Whitney.<sup>16</sup>
<div n="P"/>The sun as a maker of time<sup>17</sup> determines the year of 360 days,
which is the civil year and the usual year ({@Saṃvatsara@}) of
[Page2-467+ 70]
Vedic literature. This solar year is divided into two halves — 
the Uttarāyaṇa,<sup>18</sup> when the sun goes north, and the Dakṣiṇā-
yana,<sup>19</sup> when it goes south. There can be no doubt that these
periods denote the time when the sun turns north from the
winter solstice, and when it turns south from the summer
solstice, for the Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa<sup>20</sup> says so in perfectly clear
language. The alternative theory is to regard the periods as
those when the sun is in the north — {%i.e.,%} when it is north of the
equator, and when it is in the south, taking as points of depar-
ture the equinoxes, not the solstices; but this view has no
support in Vedic literature, and is opposed to the fact that
the equinoxes play no part in Vedic astronomical theory.<sup>21</sup>
There are only doubtful references to the solstices in the
Rigveda.<sup>22</sup>
<div n="P"/>The Brāhmaṇas,<sup>23</sup> and perhaps the Rigveda,<sup>24</sup> regard the
moon as entering the sun at new moon. According to Hille-
brandt,<sup>25</sup> the Rigveda<sup>26</sup> recognizes that the moon shines
by the borrowed light of the sun, but this seems very doubt-

These views are clearly quite wrong.
The notions of the sun given in the
Brāhmaṇas are all very naive and
simple; the distance of heaven and
the sun from the earth is the height
of a thousand cows one on the top
of the other (Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa,
xvi. 8, 6), or forty-four days' journey
for a horse ({%ibid.,%} xxv. 10, 16), or a
thousand days' journey for a horse
(Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, ii. 17, 8), or a
hundred leagues (Kausītaki Brāhmaṇa,
viii. 3). They record also such facts
as that the sun rises from and sets in
the waters (Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, iv. 20,
13; {%of.%} Nirukta, vi. 17; Kauṣītaki
Brāhmaṇa, xxiv. 4, 5; xxvi. 1), and
that it sets in the west ({%ibid.,%} xviii. 9).
The Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa calls the sun
circular (vii. 4, 1, 17), and also four-
cornered ({%catuḥ-śrakti%}) in xiv. 3, 1, 17,
and so on. See Weber, {%Indische Studien,%}

<L>3658<pc>2-469<k1>sfYjaya<k2>sfYjaya
{@Sṛñjaya@}¦ is the name of a people mentioned as early as the
Rigveda. Sṛñjaya (that is, the king of this people) {@Daivavāta@}
is celebrated as victorious over the {@Turvaśas@} and the {@Vṛcī-@}
{@vants,@}<sup>1</sup> and his sacrificial fire is referred to.<sup>2</sup> In connexion
with Daivavāta is also mentioned {@Sāhadevya Somaka,@}<sup>3</sup> no
doubt another prince; for in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa<sup>4</sup> we find
Somaka Sāhadevya and his father, Sahadeva (originally {@Suplan@})
Sārñjaya, as kings who were anointed by {@Parvata@} and
{@Nārada.@} The Rigveda<sup>5</sup> has also a Dānastuti (‘praise of gifts’)
of {@Prastoka,@}<sup>6</sup> a Sṛñjaya, who is lauded along with {@Divodāsa.@}
Moreover, {@Vītahavya@}<sup>7</sup> seems to have been a Sṛñjaya, though
Zimmer<sup>8</sup> prefers to take the derivative word, {@Vaitahavya,@} not
as a patronymic, but as an epithet.
<div n="P"/>It seems probable that the Sṛñjayas and the {@Tṛtsus@} were
closely allied, for Divodāsa and a Sṛñjaya prince are celebrated
together,<sup>9</sup> and the Turvaśas were enemies of both.<sup>10</sup> This view
is borne out by the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa,<sup>11</sup> which recognizes
{@Devabhāga Śrautarṣa@} as Purohita of the {@Kurus@} and the
Sṛñjayas.
[Page2-470+ 49]
<div n="P"/>On the other hand, some disaster certainly befel the Sṛñjayas,
at least the Vaitahavyas, for they are said in the Atharvaveda<sup>12</sup>
to have offended the {@Bhṛgus@} and to have ended miserably.
There is, it is true, no precise confirmation of this notice, but
both the Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā<sup>13</sup> and the Taittirīya Saṃhitā,<sup>14</sup> in
independent passages, refer to the Sṛñjayas having sustained
some serious loss, though the notice is in each case coupled
with a ritual error, much as in the Old Testament the fate
of kings depends on their devotion to Jahve or their dis-
obedience. It is justifiable to recognize some disaster in this
allusion.
<div n="P"/>The geographical position of the Sṛñjayas is uncertain.
Hillebrandt<sup>15</sup> suggests that in early times they must be looked
for west of the Indus with Divodāsa; he also mentions, though
he does not definitely adopt, the suggestion of Brunnhofer that
the Sṛñjayas are to be compared with the <lang n="greek">Σαράγγαι</lang><sup>16</sup> of the
Greeks, and to be located in Drangiana. Zimmer<sup>17</sup> is inclined
to locate them on the upper Indus; but it is difficult to decide
definitely in favour of any particular location. They may well
have been a good deal farther east than the Indus, since their
allies, the Tṛtsus, were in the {@Madhyadeśa,@} and were certainly
absorbed in the Kurus.
<div n="P"/>Of the history of this clan we have one notice.<sup>18</sup> They
expelled {@Duṣṭarītu Pauṃsāyana,@} one of their kings, from the
hereditary monarchy — of ten generations — and also drove out
{@Revottaras Pāṭava Cākra Sthapati,@} probably his minister,
who, however, succeeded in effecting the restoration of the
king, despite the opposition of the Kuru prince, {@Balhika@}
{@Prātīpya.@} Very probably this Kuru prince may have been at
the bottom of the movement which led to the expulsion of the
king and his minister. But the restoration of the king can
[Page2-471+ 46]
hardly be regarded, in accordance with Bloomfield's view,<sup>19</sup> as a
defeat of the Sṛñjayas.

{@Soma@}¦ was the famous plant which was used for the prepara-
tion of the libation of Soma made at the Vedic sacrifice. Its
importance is sufficiently shown by the fact that the whole of
the ninth Maṇḍala of the Rigveda, and six hymns in other
Maṇḍalas, are devoted to its praise.
<div n="P"/>Nevertheless, little is actually known of the plant. Its twigs
or shoots are described as brown ({%babhru%}),<sup>1</sup> ruddy ({%aruṇa%}),<sup>2</sup> of
tawny ({%hari%}).<sup>3</sup> Possibly its twigs hang down if the epithet
{@Naicāśākha@}<sup>4</sup> refers to the plant as Hillebrandt<sup>5</sup> thinks. The
shoot is called {%aṃśu,%}<sup>6</sup> while the plant as a whole is called
{%andhas,%}<sup>7</sup> which also denotes the juice.<sup>8</sup> {%Parvan%}<sup>9</sup> is the stem.
{%Kṣip,%}<sup>10</sup> ‘finger,’ is used as a designation of the shoots, which may
therefore have resembled fingers in shape; {%vakṣaṇā%}<sup>11</sup> and {%vāṇa%}<sup>12</sup>
also seem to have the sense of the shoot. There is some slight.
evidence to suggest that the stem was not round, but angular.<sup>13</sup>
[Page2-475+ 61]
The plant grew on the mountains,<sup>14</sup> that of {@Müjavant@} being
specially renowned.
<div n="P"/>These notices are inadequate to identify the plant. It has
been held<sup>15</sup> to be the {%Sarcostemma viminale%} or the {%Asclepias acida%}
{%(= Sarcostemma brevistigma).%} Roth<sup>16</sup> held that the {%Sarcostemma%}
{%acidum%} more nearly met the requirements of the case. Watt<sup>17</sup>
suggested the Afghan grape as the real Soma, and Rice<sup>18</sup>
thought a sugar-cane might be meant, while Max Müller and
Rājendralāla Mitra suggested that the juice was used as an
ingredient in a kind of beer — {%i.e.,%} that the Soma plant was a
species of hop. Hillebrandt<sup>19</sup> considers that neither hops nor
the grape can explain the references to Soma. It is very
probable that the plant cannot now be identified.<sup>20</sup>
<div n="P"/>In the Yajurveda<sup>21</sup> the plant is purchased ere it is pressed.
Hillebrandt<sup>22</sup> considers that the sale must be assumed for the
Rigveda. It grew on a mountain, and could not be obtained
by ordinary people: perhaps some special tribe or prince
owned it, like the {@Kīkaṭas.@}<sup>23</sup> As it stands, the ritual perform-
ance is clearly an acquisition of the Soma from the Gandharvas
(represented by a Śūdra), a ritual imitation of the action which
may have been one of the sources of the drama. Owing
to the difficulty of obtaining the real plant from a great
[Page2-476+ 61]
distance, several substitutes were allowed in the Brāhmaṇa
period.<sup>24</sup>
<div n="P"/>The plant was prepared for use by being pounded with stones
or in a mortar. The former was the normal method of pro-
cedure, appearing in the Rigveda as the usual one. The stones
are called {%grāvan%}<sup>25</sup> or {%adri,%}<sup>26</sup> and were, of course, held in the
hands.<sup>27</sup> The plant was laid on boards one beside the other
({@Adhiṣavana@}), and, according at least to the later ritual,<sup>28</sup> a
hole was dug below, so that the pounding of the plant by
means of the stones resulted in a loud noise, doubtless a
prophylactic against demoniac influences.
<div n="P"/>The plant was placed on a skin and on the Vedi<sup>29</sup> — which
was no longer done in the later ritual — {@Dhiṣaṇā@} in some
passages denoting the Vedi.<sup>30</sup>
<div n="P"/>Sometimes the mortar and pestle were used in place of the
stones.<sup>31</sup> This use, though Iranian, was apparently not common
in Vedic times.

{@Camū@}¦ denotes the vessel used for the offering to the god,<sup>32</sup>
{@Kalaśa@} and {@Camasa@} those used for the priests to drink from.
Sometimes<sup>33</sup> the Camū denotes the mortar and pestle. Perhaps
the vessel was so called because of its mortar-like shape.
<div n="P"/>The skin on which the shoots were placed was called
{@Tvac,@}<sup>34</sup> or twice {%go%} (‘cow-hide’).<sup>35</sup> {@Kośa,@}<sup>36</sup> Sadhastha,<sup>37</sup> {@Dru,@}<sup>38</sup>
[Page2-477+ 76]
{@Vana,@}<sup>39</sup> {@Droṇa,@}<sup>40</sup> are all terms used for Soma vessels, while
{@Sruva@}<sup>41</sup> denotes the ‘ladle.’
<div n="P"/>Apparently the plant was sometimes steeped in water to
increase its yield of juice.<sup>42</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is not possible to describe exactly the details of the process
of pressing the Soma as practised in the Rigveda. It was
certainly purified by being pressed through a sieve<sup>43</sup> ({@Pavitra@}).
The Soma was then used unmixed ({%śukra,%}<sup>44</sup> {%śuci%})<sup>45</sup> for Indra and
{@Vāyu,@} but the {@Kaṇvas@} seem to have dropped this usage.<sup>46</sup> The
juice is described as brown ({%babhru%}),<sup>47</sup> tawny ({%hari%}),<sup>48</sup> or ruddy
({%aruṇa%}),<sup>49</sup> and as having a fragrant smell,<sup>50</sup> at least as a
rule.<sup>51</sup>
<div n="P"/>Soma was mixed with milk ({@Gavāśir@}),<sup>52</sup> curd or sour milk
({@Dadhyāśir@}),<sup>53</sup> or grain ({@Yavāśir@}).<sup>54</sup> The admixtures are
[Page2-478+ 67]
alluded to with various figurative expressions, as {@Atka,@}
‘armour’;<sup>55</sup> {@Vastra@}<sup>56</sup> or {@Vāsas,@}<sup>57</sup> ‘garment’; {@Abhiśrī,@}<sup>58</sup> ‘admix-
ture’; {%rūpa,%}<sup>59</sup> ‘beauty’; {%śrī,%}<sup>60</sup> ‘splendour’; {%rasa,%}<sup>61</sup> ‘flavour’;
{%prayas,%}<sup>62</sup> ‘dainty’; and perhaps {%nabhas,%}<sup>63</sup> ‘fragrance.’ The
adjective {%tīvra%}<sup>64</sup> denotes the ‘pungent’ flavour of Soma when
so mixed. The Soma shoots, after the juice has been pressed
out, are denoted by {%ṛjīṣa,%} ‘residue.’<sup>65</sup>
<div n="P"/>It seems probable that in some cases honey was mixed with
Soma: perhaps the {%kośa madhu-ścut,%} ‘the pail distilling sweet-
ness,’ was used for the mixing.<sup>66</sup> It seems doubtful if Surā was
ever so mixed.<sup>67</sup>
<div n="P"/>There were three pressings a day of Soma, as opposed to the
two of the Avesta.<sup>68</sup> The evening pressing was specially
connected with the Ṛbhus, the midday with Indra, the
morning with Agni, but the ritual shows that many other gods
also had their share.<sup>69</sup> The drinker of Soma and the non-
drinker are sharply discriminated in the texts.<sup>70</sup> Localities
where Soma was consumed were {@Ārjīka, Pastyāvant, Śarya-@}
{@ṇāvant, Suṣomā,@} the territory of the {@Pañcajanāḥ@} or ‘five
[Page2-479+ 64]
peoples,’ and so on.<sup>71</sup> The effects of Soma in exhilarating and
exciting the drinkers are often alluded to.<sup>72</sup>
<div n="P"/>It is difficult to decide if Soma was ever a popular, as opposed
to a hieratic drink. The evidence for its actual popularity is
very slight,<sup>73</sup> and not decisive.

firmation of the later description, in
a medical work, of the plant as ill-
smelling. But this plant may have
been a different one from that used in

been due to a substitute being used, or
to the genuine plant, brought from a

prized in Avestic times. It is, however,
seldom spoken of as giving the priests
pleasure: Rv. i. 91, 13; viii. 2, 12;
x. 167, 3. There are many references
to sickness caused by it (Maitrāyaṇī

caused by vomiting Soma as Indra had
done: Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 3, 2, 5, 6;
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, v. 5, 4, 9; xii. 7,

itself is no doubt older (see also {@Viṣū-@}

traditional identification of the plant,
for the medical passage quoted by

vomiting. See also Zimmer, {%Altindisches%}

<L>3717<pc>2-485<k1>strI<k2>strI
{@Strī@}¦ is the ordinary word in poetry and prose for ‘woman,’
without special reference to her as a wife or as a maiden. {@Nārī@}
has the same sense, but disappears in later prose, while {@Gnā@}
refers only to the wives of the gods, and {@Yoṣit,@} with its cognate
words, denotes the young woman as ripe for marriage.<sup>1</sup> In the
Rigveda<sup>2</sup> Strī stands opposed to {@Pumāṃs,@} ‘man,’ and once to
{%vṛṣan,%} ‘male person’; not until the Atharvaveda<sup>3</sup> does it mean
‘wife’ as opposed to {@Pati,@} ‘husband,’ and even in the Sūtras it
is sharply opposed to {@Jāyā.@}
<div n="P"/>In Vedic India by far the greater part of a woman's life was
taken up in her marriage and marital relations (see Pati and
{@Mātṛ@}). There is no trace in the Rigveda of the seclusion
of women, which was practically complete in all but the
earliest Epic:<sup>4</sup> the maiden may be assumed to have grown up
in her father's house, enjoying free intercourse with the youth
of the village, and sharing in the work of the house. Educa-
tion<sup>5</sup> was not denied to them, at any rate in certain cases, for
we hear in the Upaniṣads of women who could take no
unimportant part in disputations on philosophical topics.
Moreover, women were taught to dance and sing, which were
unmanly accomplishments.<sup>6</sup>
<div n="P"/>Of the exact legal position of daughters the notices are few
and meagre. The Rigveda,<sup>7</sup> however, shows that in the place
[Page2-486+ 60]
of a father the brother was looked to for aid, and that brother-
less maidens were apt to be ruined, though religious terrors
were believed to await the man who took advantage of their
defencelessness.<sup>8</sup> Moreover, women could not take an inherit-
ance,<sup>9</sup> and were not independent persons in the eyes of the
law, whether married or not. Presumably before marriage
they lived on their parents or brothers, and after that on their
husbands, while in the event of their husbands predeceasing
them, their relatives took the property, burdened with the
necessity of maintaining the wife.<sup>10</sup> Their earnings would be
appropriated by their nearest relative — usually father or brother
-in the few cases in which unmarried women could earn
anything, as in the case of courtezans.

‘sister.’ Like the word {@Bhrātṛ,@} the term sister can be applied

the fingers and the seasons are ‘sisters,’ and night is the sister
of dawn, for whom, as the elder, she makes way.<sup>2</sup> The {@Paṇis@}

applied — any more than in the case of Bhrātṛ — to ordinary

father was dead or feeble, the sister was dependent on her
brother and on his wife, as appears from the Rigveda<sup>4</sup> and the
Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.<sup>5</sup> Moreover, maidens without brothers
were apt to find marriage difficult, and to degenerate into
Hetairai;<sup>6</sup> but it is not certain whether this was due, as
Zimmer<sup>7</sup> thinks, to brothers being required to arrange
marriages for orphan girls, or because sonless fathers were

{@Hemanta,@}¦ ‘winter,’ occurs only once in the Rigveda,<sup>1</sup> but
often in the later texts.<sup>2</sup> Zimmer<sup>3</sup> is inclined to trace
differences of climate in the Rigveda: he thinks that certain
hymns,<sup>4</sup> which ignore winter and insist on the rains, indicate a
different place and time of origin from those which refer to the
snowy mountains.<sup>5</sup> It is, however, quite impossible to separate
parts of the Rigveda on this basis. It is probable that that
text owes its composition in the main to residents in the later
{@Madhyadeśa;@} hence the references to cold and snow are rather
a sign of local than of temporal differences. It is otherwise
with the later expansion of the three into four seasons,

3, 3, 5; 9, 2), usually in connexion with various rites for
acquiring a village. Since in these cases repeated mention is
made of obtaining pre-eminence over {@Sajātas@} and Samānas,
‘equals,’ it is probable that allowance must also be made for
the control over his fellow-villagers which an ambitious man
could obtain ({%e.g.,%} by loans), and which might end by giving
him the position of a great landlord, even without the interven-
tion of the king.
<P>{@Caṇḍātaka@} in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (v. 2, 1, 8) and the

<P>{@Camū.@} — Oldenberg
<F>1) {%Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft,%} 62, 459-470.</F> considers that even in the dual the word
denotes two vessels into which the Soma, often mixed with
water in the {@Kośa@} and purified with the sieve, was poured, and
that, in the plural, reference is made to these and other vessels
into which the Soma was put at the various stages of the
[Page2-514+ 34]
process. {@Kalaśa@} similarly denoted either one (sing.) or several
(plur.) of the vessels, the dual not being used, since the dual of
{@Camū@} was reserved for the two vessels {%par excellence.%} In the
later ritual the Camūs are replaced by the Droṇa-Kalaśa and
the Pūtabhṛt, which was, however, assimilated in form and
material (being made of clay, not of wood) to the Ādhāvanīya,
the later name of the Kośa. The main difficulty of this theory
is that it is hard to explain why Kalaśa never occurs in the
dual. Geldner
<F>2) {%Ṛgveda, Glossar,%} 60.</F> falls back on the older view that in Camū
(dual) the two boards of the Soma press are meant.

<P>{@Dṛṣadvatī.@} — The identification of this river with the Ghaggar

{%Society of Bengal,%} 61, 422), or Chitrung (Oldham, {%Journal of the%}

<F>1) {%Journal of the American Oriental%}

<F>2) {%The Arctic Home in the Vedas,%} 103-
107.</F> has argued that the dawns of the arctic
regions in the interglacial period must be meant. But the
reference is apparently to the thirty dawns of the thirty days
which constitute the Vedic month. See {@Māsa.@}
<P>{@Rakṣas@} in the early Vedic literature normally refers to
demons, and is only metaphorically
<F>1) Rv. iii. 30, 15-17; vii. 104, 1. 2;
Muir, {%Sanskrit Texts,%} 2^2, 389 {%et seq.%}</F> applied to human foes.
No definite tribe is meant.
<F>2) {%Cf.%} Grierson, {%Zeitschrift der Deutschen%}
{%Morgenländischen Gesellschaft,%} 66, 68.
Similarly {@Piśācas@} are not a tribe in
Vedic literature, whatever they may
be later.</F>
<P>{@Rājasūya.@} — Read ‘victor’ for ‘victim’ in line 12.
<P>{@Lahyāyana,@} 2, 232, should be {@Lāhyāyani,@} and the reference,
iii. 3, 1, 2.
[Page2-517+ 47]
<P>1. {@Varṣā-hū,@} ‘frog’ (‘calling in the rains’), is one of the
victims at the Aśvamedha (‘horse sacrifice’) in the Vājasaneyi
Saṃhitā (xxiv. 38).
<P>2. {@Varṣā-hū@} (‘produced in the rains’) is the name
<F>1) The form seems to show {%h%} for {%bh,%}
as in other cases given by Wackernagel,
{%Altindische Grammatik,%} 1, 217^b; {%varṣā-%}
{%bhū%} actually occurs in the same sense
in post-Vedic Sanskrit.</F> of a plant
({%Boerhavia procumbens%}) in the Taittirīya Saṃhitā (iii. 4, 10, 3).
<P>{@Vaśā@} is frequently qualified by {%anūbandhyā%}
<F>1) {%E.g.,%} Taittirīya Saṃhitā, ii. 2, 9, 7; Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā, x. 1.</F> (‘to be bound for
slaughtering’); the economy of killing a barren cow probably
tended to produce the sense of ‘barren’ in the word.
<P>{@Vāc.@} — Grierson, in his discussion
<F>1) {%Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlän-%}
{%dischen Gesellschaft,%} 66, 66, n. 1.</F> of the Paiśācī speech,
holds that the passage cited as the speech of the Asuras in the
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, {%he 'lavo (= he 'rayaḥ),%}
<F>2) {%Op. cit.,%} 64, 104 {%et seq.%}</F> can be regarded
as in Paiśācī just as much as in Māgadhī, since the change of
{%r%} to {%l,%} and of {%y%} to {%v,%} is found in Paiśācī also. Sten Konow,
<F>2) {%Op. cit.,%} 64, 104 {%et seq.%}</F>
however, considers that Paiśācī was the speech used in the
Vindhya region. It would be unwise, as a matter of fact, to
lay stress on the phrase {%he 'lavo,%} because both the reading and the
sense are by no means certain.
<F>3) It should be noted that the phrase
cannot be genuine Prākrit as it stands,
for that would not give us {%he 'lavo%}
{%he 'lavaḥ.%}</F> But it should be noted that
the easterners and the Asuras are elsewhere in the Śatapatha
Brāhmaṇa
<F>4) xiii. 8, 1, 5. Probably the view of
the earlier part of the Śatapatha Brāh-
maṇa (iii. 2, 1, 23) would be the same,
since its reputed author, {@Yājñavalkya@}
is connected in tradition with the East.
Dr. Grierson's argument would have
been stronger had the reference oc-
curred in one of the {@Śāṇḍilya@} books</F> connected: this tells against Dr. Grierson's view.
<P>{@Vātāvata@} and {@Vātāvant,@} 2, 284, should be read for {@Vātavata@}
and {@Vātavant.@}
<P>{@Vāsas.@} — In the Taittirīya Saṃhitā (ii. 2, 11, 4) {%upādhāyya-%}
{%pūrvaya,%} as an epithet of Vāsas, appears to denote ‘fringed
({%citrānta%}) according to Āpastamba Śrauta Sūtra, xix. 20, 2.
<P>{@Viṣāṇakā,@} 2, 313, headline, for ‘31,’ read ‘313.’
[Page2-518+ 39]
<P>{@Vehat@} occurs in conjunction with {@Vaśā@} in the Kāṭhaka Saṃ-
hitā (xxxviii. 10), the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā (iii. 11, 11), the
Vājasaneyī Saṃhitā (xxi. 21), and the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa
(ii. 6, 18, 4).
<P>{@Vairiṇa,@} 2, 318, should be {@Vīraṇa.@}
<P>{@Vyat,@} 1, 523, should be Vyant.
<P>{@Śamyā@} in the Brāhmaṇas
<F>1) Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, i. 6, 1, 1;
Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, i. 1, 1, 22; 2, 1,
16; v. 2, 3, 2; Baudhāyana Śrauta
Sūtra, i. 7; Āpastamba Śrauta Sūtra,
xviii. 8, 12, etc.</F> frequently denotes the wooden
support on which the lower of the two millstones ({@Dṛṣad@}) is
placed.
<P>{@Syāmaiajayanta,@} 1, 185, should be {@Śyāmasujayanta.@}
<P>{@Śruṣṭi@} (more correctly {@Śnuṣṭi@}) {@Aṅgirasa,@} 2, 397, should come
on p. 403, before {@Śruṣṭigu; and Sukurīra@} before {@Sukeśin,@} 2, 453.
<P>{@Saṃvatsara.@} — Tilak
<F>1) {%The Arctic Home in the Vedas,%} 280-
288.</F> argues that the Rigveda
<F>2) ii. 12, 11 ({%catvāriṃśyāṃ śaradi%}).</F> and the Athar-
vaveda
<F>3) xii. 3, 34 ({%ṣaṣṭyāṃ śaratsu;%} the
plural, Tilak thinks, denotes, every
year’).</F> contain signs of a dating by season and day, but neither
of the passages adduced by him is at all probably so taken.
<P>{@Sāyakāyana,@} 1, 155, {@Sobhari,@} 1, 261, {@Saukarāyaṇa,@} 1, 155,
should be read for Sāyakāyana, Sobhari, and Saukarāyaṇa
respectively.
