ap-meta2.txt
07-11-2017

This file describes the coding conventions of ap.txt, which is the current
version of the Apte1957 digitization. For previous versions, see ap-meta.txt.

ap.txt uses the utf-8 encoding for extended ASCII characters.

The {X...X} style of coding serves several purposes:
{#...#} : devanagari coded in SLP1 transliteration. Closed in each line.
{%.. %} : italic text. Closed in each line.
{@..@}  : bold text. Closed in each line.
{sic}   : Possible text error (9 instances)
{**}    : A particular typographic  symbol (1 instance)
{^}     : A particalar typographic  symbol (1 instance)


The following  <x> type tags are found in ap.txt:
<Poem>..</Poem> : 1 instance
<HS>  2  : End of volume indicator

Meta lines: 
Each entry of the digitization is contained within a beginning and ending
markup. As example,
<L>3<pc>0001-2<k1>aMS<k2>aMS
{#aMS#}¦ €10U. {#aMSayati-te#} also {#aMSApayati#} To divide, distribute, share among.
<LEND>

The ending markup is <LEND>.
The beginning markup contains various identifying fields, expressed in
a <fieldname>fieldvalue format. The fields are:
required fields
  L Cologne record identifier
  pc page-col reference to scanned image
  k1 key1. The headword spelling, in slp1 coding for Sanskrit headwords
  k2 key2. The original headword spelling, either in slp1 or IAST

optional field for homonym
  hom The homonym number (usually a digit). Rarely occurs in ap dictionary

---------------------------------

Page breaks are coded as [Page...], and occur on separate lines.
In general, a page number has form [PagePPPP-C] where PPPP is page number and
C is column number (1 or 3).
70 page breaks have form
[PagePPPP-UC]  Where U is a,b, or c (these occur at letter breaks).
Page 632 is missing in the PDF

The lines of the digitization generally represent 'sections' of the text; the
actual line-breaks of the text are not coded.

Headword coding is exemplified by: 
.{#a#}¦   no-homonymn
.{#udan#}^1¦  homonym
The general form is .{#X#}^h¦
where X (key1) is coded in SLP1 transliteration.


The headwords are ordered according to Sanskrit alphabet ordering.

Non-Devanagari Sanskrit in the body of the entries has been converted 
to IAST unicode, generally as described in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration. 
This differs in several respects from the coding of the printed version.
