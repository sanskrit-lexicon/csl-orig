<H>PRELIMINARY REMARKS.
<P>In 1850 Professor WILSON authorized the late Mr. ASHER, of Berlin, to publish a new edition of his Sanskrit
and English Dictionary, the second edition having been out of print for many years. As the illustrious author, how-
ever, was prevented by his various duties from devoting the requisite time to preparing this edition, I was invited
to carry out the intended plan.
<P>According to this plan, the second edition of the Dictionary was to be reprinted in its original form, while I was
to superintend the impression, and make such corrections, alterations and additions as might seem advisable. But as
a leading object with the publisher was to supply the work within the shortest possible time, it was urged that the ad-
ditions, in order not to cause any great delay, were not to exceed the materials I might happen already to possess
or which might present themselves incidentally during the progress of the work.
<P>Had this plan been adhered to on my part, it might, no doubt, long since have been easily accomplished. Yet
when I resolved on a protracted residence in London, and thus found it in my power to turn to account printed and
unprinted books which could not be had on the continent, I thought it incumbent on me to improve the opportunity and
to advise the publisher to forego considerations of speed for what I believed to be a more lasting service to the student
of Sanskrit literature and philology. I proposed therefore not merely to embody in the intended work the materials I
possessed and which, having been collected for different purposes, would not always suffice for the requirements of
lexicography, but to extend them, to enlarge the substance of the second edition within its own sphere, and also to
introduce into it matter from those portions of Sanskrit literature which Professor WILSON had not deemed it necessary
to resort to at the time he published his work. I was informed, it is true, that causes over which I had no control,
would not allow me to go beyond certain limits of space or to alter the character of the previous Dictionary by making
references to the original authorities from which the information was derived, and therefore that I could not incorporate
in the results of my labour more complete indices of special works than were absolutely requisite; still I believed that
in spite of these limitations, it might be possible to adapt the intended work to the more pressing actual wants of the
Sanskrit philologer.
<P>That these alterations were sanctioned by Professor WILSON himself, it is almost needless to say. But I owe
it to the memory of the late Mr. ASHER to state that he readily waived the advantages derivable from a more expe-
ditious publication for the literary considerations which I had suggested.
<P>Circumstances, however, intervened which caused a still greater delay than I had anticipated. It was obvious
that to correct in the second edition such errors as could not but be expected in a work of this magnitude, and to do
so on my own responsibility, no other course was open to me than to examine the Dictionary word for word and meaning
for meaning, in other terms, to trace its entire contents as far as possible to the sources from which they were taken.
Unfortunately the Indices prepared in India by Professor WILSON were, with few exceptions, no longer available; I was
obliged therefore to give additional time to collecting the materials required for a proper discharge of my duty in this
respect. Another circumstance must be adverted to. In the existing editions of his Dictionary Professor WILSON has
excluded, on principle, words relating to the Vaidik literature, more especially to those works which bear the technical
name of Vedas. Notwithstanding the extension I proposed to give to his work, I still approved of this principle also
for the new Dictionary; I may add that the first pages of my MS. were written in accordance with it. Subsequent
experience, however, of the treatment which this portion of the literature has undergone in other quarters, has im-
posed upon me the moral obligation of allotting even to words of the Vaidik period a large share in the present work
and, as a consequence, to increase materials I possessed, but on which it was not originally intended to bestow special
labour and time. I now propose, in the Dictionary and {%its Supplement,%} to provide the student with the interpretation of
the principal Vaidik words that may be desired for the perusal of the Vaidik hymns and the chief works of the oldest
literature. Those alone will remain excluded the meaning of which could not be given on safe grounds as, in general,
it did not seem expedient to me, to admit into a Dictionary devoid of quotations, words the sense of which could not
be ascertained satisfactorily.
[Pagetitle-iv+ 48]
<P>A detailed account of the materials used in the present work must necessarily be deferred to a later date. I
embrace, however, the opportunity now offered me, to express my obligation to Dr. TH. AUFRECHT for the kindness
with which he allowed me the use of his Indices of the Hārāvalī, Trikāṇḍaśeṣa, Bṛhad-and Chhāndogya-Upanishads
and of the Vājasaneyisamhitā, as well as to Mr. CH. CASSAL for the assistance I have derived from an elaborate Index
he has made of Hemachandra's Anekārtha and which, according to a recent advertisement of Mr. S. AUSTIN'S at Hertford,
is now in course of publication together with the Anekārtha themselves, an Index and improvements of former editions
of the Abhidhānachintāmaṇi.
<P>The reasons which have induced me to base the etymological and generally the grammatical portion of the work
on the native authorities, to retain the technical terms of Pāṇini's school, to accompany the crude forms of the com-
pounds with their grammatical names, and to adopt a technical method of marking certain Upapada-compounds, not to
accentuate the words in the Dictionary,--these and other topics relating to its interior economy will have to be explained
in the Preface, although some of them may be gathered indirectly from a critical pamphlet the first part of which will
soon appear.
<P>The comparatively short time placed at my disposal for the preparatory labour and the considerations I had to
yield to when I allowed the printing to being, have forced upon me the necessity of adding to the Dictionary a Supple-
ment which to judge from the increase of matter since the first sheets were struck off will become a rather extensive one.
Having to choose between suppressing the additional matter which will accrue during the progress of the work, and
claiming the indulgence of the reader for the inconvenience of a Supplement, I could not hesitate in deciding on the
latter alternative. The Supplement will enable me, too, to supply omissions made inadvertently and to avoid the con-
sequence of excluding altogether those words or meanings which I might not feel justified in giving at the time being
on the score of doubtful authorities and which I preferred therefore to reserve till I could apply to them the result of more
extended research. Subjoined to the Supplement will be Appendices containing an explanation of the technical terms used
in the Dictionary, etymological essays, a treatise on the accentuation &c., and lastly an Index of English words referring
to the Sanskrit word the meaning of which they represent with the number of the page, column and line.
<P>These brief remarks will indicate my plan so far as it is necessary here; they will not, however, convey an
impression of the assistance I have derived from and the obligation which I owe to the previous editions of Professor
WILSON'S Dictionary. It would be unbecoming, on my part, in my present relation to these works, to speak of the
care, the conscientiousness and the scholarship which they so eminently combine; but, on the other hand I should be
wanting in justice were I to conceal the conviction I entertain that they have been the safest guide I could have found
when entering upon the present task, or were I not to mention that the changes I have introduced are owing, not to
the objection I make against the principle on which they are framed, but either to personal views or to the claims of
the actual condition of Sanskrit philology. But still less will these remarks be able to testify the gratitude which I
feel to the illustrious and venerable scholar himself. I have not only enjoyed, at all times, the benefit of his great literary
experience and of his invaluable advice, but he has manifested his active interest and concurrence in the present work
in taking upon himself the labour of correcting the printed proofs; above all, his spirit of genuine kindness and his rare
liberality have left on my mind impressions so lasting and profound that it will always give me the most heartfelt satis-
faction to look upon whatever good may arise from this book as virtually produced by him.
<P>I must also record the sense I entertain of the services of my present publishers. After a premature death had
closed the active career of Mr. ASHER, they have not merely taken up his plan but entered into it with the same zeal
and intelligence. I cannot forego the pleasure of mentioning the handsome manner in which they have allowed all the
literary considerations I have suggested to prevail over personal interest, and their ready acquiescence in the long and
unexpected delay; for no one can feel more convinced than I am, that without this friendly and scientific disposition
on their part--and I may add, too, without the creditable manner in which the printer acquits himself of his portion
of the duty--the irksome mechanical toil which is so abundantly inflicted upon the author of a lexicographical work would
probably not have failed to leave its unpleasant traces in the labour itself still more than, I fear, may actually be the case.

short stature, and is said by some to have been born in a
water jar; hence his names Kumbhasambhava, Ghaṭod-
bhava &c. He is famed for having swallowed the ocean,
when it had given him offence, wherefore he is called Pī-
tābdhi. At his command the Vindhya range of mountains
prostrated itself, and so remains; hence his present appel-

{#aNgiras#}¦ I. m. sing. ({#-rAH#}) The proper name of a Maharshi,
a great Ṛṣi or saint who is the reputed author of many
vaidik hymns, but who is mentioned also in a subse-
[Page020-a+ 56]
quent period as one of the inspired legislators of India
and as the author of an astronomical work. The various
legends connected with his life seem to have been occasioned
by the word {#aNgiras#} coming from the same radical as,
and its sound recalling that of, {#agni,#} fire (q. v.). Hence
we find Angiras sometimes either as an epithet or as the
father of Agni, and the Saint himself connected chiefly with
such hymns as are addressed to Agni, to Indra or to dei-
ties of a kindred description: a portion of the fourth Veda,
the Atharvan, reports him also as an expounder of the
Brahmavidyā (q. v.) or the sacred knowledge, that had been
imparted to him by Satyavāha, a descendant of Bharadvāja.
(See {#aNgir#}.) Though Angiras, as may be concluded from his
name being connected with the authorship of a great por-
tion of the sacred Hindu literature, appears to have been
one of the oldest civilizers of India, no historical date is
to be obtained from the epic or pauranik literature where
the vaidik legends of his life are merely amplified; there
he is named as one of the Prajāpatis or progenitors of
mankind engendered, according to some by Manu, accord-
ing to others by Brahmā himself, either with the female
half of his body or from his mouth or from the space
between his eye-brows. As such he is considered also as
one of the seven Ṛṣis who preside over the reign of the
first Manu or Svāyambhuva. He is called, besides, the priest
of the Gods, the Lord of the sacrifice &c. Sometimes he
is considered as a son of Uru by Āgneyī, the daughter of
Agni. His daughters are the Ṛchas (or vaidik hymns) and
also, Śaśvatī, Sinīvālī, Kuhū, Rākā, Anumati; his sons
are Samvarta, the manes called Havishmats, Utathya,
Bṛhaspati, Mārkanḍeya; his wives, Smṛti (traditional
science), two daughters of Daksha, Svadhā and Satī, and
Śraddhā, the daughter of the sage Kardama. As an astro-
nomical personification he is Bṛhaspati himself or the regent
of the planet Jupiter and presides over the sixth year of
the cycle of sixty years. See also {#aTarvan#}.
<div n="P">II. m. pl. ({#-rasaH#}) <sup>1</sup> The descendants of the former. In this
capacity they share also in the nature of the legends attri-
buted to Angiras. Angiras being the father of Agni, they
are considered as descendants of Agni himself, who is also
called the first of the Angirasas. Like Angiras, they occur
in hymns addressed to the luminous deities and, at a later
period, they become for the most part personifications of
light, of luminous bodies, of divisions of time, of celestial
phenomena and fires adapted to peculiar occasions as the
full and change of the moon, or to particular rites as the
Aśvamedha, Rājasūya, the Pākayajnas or sacrifices with
food, obsequial and funeral fires, expiatory fires, and the
like. Most of the authors of the hymns of the Rigveda are
connected with them and in the Purāṇas mention is made of
two tribes of the Angirasas which were Brāhmaṇas as well
as Kshatriyas. <sup>2</sup> The hymns of the Atharvaveda. See also
{#aTarvan#} pl. and {#aTarvANgiras#} pl. E. {#aNg,#} uṇ. aff. {#asi#} with
āgama {#iruw,#} or, according to another authority, a Tatpur.
composed of {#an#} (meaning {#anna#} food, from {#an#} kṛt aff. {#kvip#})
and {#giras#} (from {#gF#} to swallow) ‘devouring food’. The latter
[Page020-b+ 56]
etymology, apparently without any grammatical authority,
would refer especially to {#aNgiras#} as epithet of Agni. See
also {#aNgirastama#}. The plural {#aNgirasaH#} is considered, though
without any etymological necessity, as the plural of the
deriv. form {#ANgirasa#} with luk or elision of the affix.

Maharshi or a great Saint, who in the Vedas occurs especi-
ally in hymns composed for the praise of Agni, Indra, the
Aśvins and the Viśvadevas; and who in the epic period
is considered as one of the ten Prajāpatis or lords of crea-
tion engendered by Manu for the purpose of creating the
universe; at a later period he appears as a mindborn son
of Brahmā and as one of the seven Ṛṣis who preside
over the reign of Svāyambhuva, the first, or according to
others of Svārochiṣa, the second, or of Vaivaswata, the
seventh Manu; he is married to Anasūyā, the daughter of
Daksha and their son is Durvāsas. Produced by a flash of
light from his eye which was received by Space, the via
lactea personified, or according to a more recent legend,
by his penitence, is Soma or the moon. See {#atrijAta,#}
{#atridfgja, atrinetraja#} &c. As sons of his are also named
the Manes Barhishads and Udamaya; a daughter of his is
Apālā. The name of Atri occurs also as that of the author
of several vaidik hymns, as that of an inspired legislator,
of the author of an astronomical and medical work and,
in astronomy, as one of the seven Ṛṣis in the constel-
lation of the great bear.--An Atri, son of Sāṅkhya, but
probably a different personage, is the author of a hymn in
the Ṛgveda.--Amongst the authors of vaidik hymns we
find as sons or descendants of Atri the following: Archa-
nāna, Avasyu, Bāhuvṛkta, Bhauma, Budha, Dvita, Ga-
viṣṭhira, Gaya, Gopavana, Isha, Paura, Pratibhānu, Pra-
tiprabha, the Prayaswats, Purīṣa, Ratahavya, Sadāpṛṇa,
Saptavadhri, Śaśa, Satyaśravas, Śrutavid, Sutambhara,
Śyāvāśva, Vasuśruta, the Vasūyus, Viśvasāman, Yajata;

great Soma sacrifices (see {#ftvij#}) and, amongst them,
one of the four leading priests (see besides {#brahman, udgAtf#}

rushas or assistant priests are the {#pratiprasTAtf, nezwwa#} and

mānsā decides in doubtful cases, viz. whenever a sacrifice
mentioned in and making part of the ritual of the Yajur-
veda, is mentioned also and forms part of another Veda,
whether the Adhwaryu has another priest to share in
his functions or whether he has to abstain from the pro-
ceedings altogether. The ten {#camasADvaryu#} (q. v.), who,
are also assistants or purushas of the Adhwaryu, are dis-

a synonyme of {#anagnidagDa,#} as well as the converse of {#agni-#}

be a synonyme of {#agnidagDa#}. Anagniṣvātta does not occur

shares in some qualities with other things which are pe-
rishable. E. {#anitya#} and {#sama#} (in the sense of {#jAti,#} sophism);
the masc. form of this word is explained according to some,
by the ellipsis of {#pratizeDa#} or contradiction, as a Sūtra in
the Nyāya treating on a sophism is always followed by
another containing the refutation; or, according to others,
by the ellipsis of {#vikalpa#} (in the sense of {#viviDaH kalpaH#}
i. e. {#prakAraH#} or variousness), there being various sophisms,
viz. twenty-four; or according to others, by the ellipsis of
{#prayoga#} i. e. a (logical) proceeding which likens or produces
the plausibility of perishableness; or the word is taken as
a Bahuvr. with the ellipsis of {#prayoga#} i. e. a logical proceeding

verbs; in the Vedas it is sometimes also used adverbially.

Not elevated, not being pronounced with the accent called
{#udAtta#} (q. v.) or {#svarita#} (q. v.) (as the syllable of a word).
<div n="P">2. m. ({#-ttaH#}) The not elevated accent, the accent (see
{#svara#} and {#vAhyaprayatna#}) which is neither {#udAtta#} (q. v.) nor
{#svarita#} (q. v.) and which by the depression of the voice, it
requires, prepares, as it were, for the greater effort in the
pronunciation of the syllables accented with the {#udAtta#} or
{#svarita#}. This depression being the greatest when the syl-
lable having the {#anudAtta#} accent, is immediately followed
by a syllable accented with the {#udAtta#} or {#svarita,#} the {#anu-#}
{#dAtta#} is called in this case {#anudAttatara#} ‘a very anudātta’.
The mode of marking the {#anudAtta,#} is restricted, as is also
the case with the other two accents, to the vaidik Sanhitās
(Sanhitā-Pāṭhas) and Brāhmaṇas, and varies according to
the different Vedas. In the Sanhitā, Pada and the Brāhmaṇas
of the Ṛgveda, in the Sanhitā and Pada of the Yajur- and
Sanhitā of the Atharvaveda the Anudātta is marked with a
horizontal line under the syllable so accented ({%thus becoming%}
{%comparable also in graphic value to the sign of the Virāma, the%}
{%horizontal line representing as it were the repose in accentua-%}
{%tion%}); in the Brāhmaṇas of the White Yajurveda, it is not
marked at all; and in the Sanhitā of the Sāmaveda the anu-
dātta syllable when anudāttatara before an udātta, or before
a svarita syllable bearing the figures {#2#} or {#3,#} is marked with
the figure {#3#} over it, except when it is preceded in the be-
ginning of a verse by other anudātta syllables, in which
case only the first anudātta syllable bears the figure {#3,#}
while the following anudātta syllables are left unmarked.
If the anudāttatara is followed by a svarita syllable bearing
the sign {#2ra,#} the syllable so accented is marked with {#3ka#}.
In the Pada-text of the Sāmaveda the sign {#3#} denotes the
anudāttatara before an udātta, if the latter occupies the
second syllable from the beginning, or the syllable before
an anudāttatara, if the latter is followed by a svarita, or
lastly the anudātta accentuation of a syllable so marked and
of all the syllables following it until an udātta or svarita
syllable comes; the sign {#3ka#} or {#ka#} denotes the anudāttatara
immediately followed by a svarita. Compare also the terms
{#nIca, nihata, nyasta, nyastatara, niyata, niGAta, nyAsa, niyama#}
and the radd. {#han#} with {#ni#} and {#yam#} with {#ni#}.--In the native

in general, it being pronounced through the nose and with
the appropriate organ of speech, as {#N#} through the nose
and the throat, {#Y#} through the nose and with the palate &c.
<sup>2</sup> (Conditionally) a vowel or {#y, v, l;#} in this case the nasal
nature of the sound is indicated by the sign {#M~#}. (N. B. {#yM~#} or
{#vM~#} represent the value of {#y#} or {#v#} preceded by {#m; lM~#} that
of {#l#} preceded by {#m#} or {#n#}. In the pause a final vowel may
be anunāsika. A {%short%} anunāsika vowel, when not occurr-
ing in a pause, represents apparently always the value of
the same vowel and {#m#} or {#n;#} it must be, in general, the
last vowel sound of the former part of a compound or of
the word itself, followed by a final sibilant, e. g. {#saM~skartA#}
instead of {#sams-kartA, puM~ScalI = pums-calI, tasmiM~stvA =#}
{#tasmins-tvA#}. Only a few exceptions of this rule are mentioned
by the vaidik grammarians, e. g. {#aminantaM~ evEH,#} when {#a#} of {#nta#}
is anunāsika, although it does neither stand in a pause nor
represent more than its own sound.--A {%long%} anunāsika
vowel, when not occurring in a pause, may be generally
considered as representing the value of its short vowel and
an original {#nts#} or of its short vowel and {#nt,#} provided {#s#} or
its substitute has been preserved; e. g. {#mahAM~ indraH = mahants#}
{#indraH, daDanvAM~ yaH = daDanvants yaH, sargAM~ iva = sargants iva#}
or {#mahAM~Scarati = mahants carati, dasyUM~rekaH = dasyunts ekaH#}.
The material difference that prevails between the anunāsika
({#M~#}) and the anusvāra ({#M#}) sound, does not appear to have
been kept alive beyond the period of the vaidik literature,
when an interchange between both was not deemed legiti-
mate; according to the grammarians of the classical period,
in the latter the anunāsika may be replaced by the anu-
svāra. The sign of the anunāsika ({#M~#}), however, is but
seldom met with in the ordinary Mss. referring to the post-
vaidik literature; and from the reasons stated, its use in
vaidik Mss. is objectionable, when it occurs in words like
{#yaSAM~si, DanUM~zi, viSvezAM~ hitaH#} or in {#maM~hizWa, vAjaM~ sanizat, indraM~#}
{#stavAma#} and similar instances in which the long nasal vowel
does not represent more than the value of a short vowel
and a nasal, or in which the short nasal vowel is not fol-
lowed by a final sibilant.) E. {#anu#} and {#nAsikA#}.

<L>3200<pc>098-a<k1>anumAna<k2>anumAna
{#anumAna#}¦ Tatpur. n. ({#-nam#}) <sup>1</sup> Inferring, as the cause of {#anumiti#}
or of a conclusion drawn from given premises. According to
the Sāṅkhya and Yoga-philosophies it is one of the {%three%}
means (see {#pramARa#}) by which true knowledge may be ob-
tained (see also {#pratyakza#} or {#dfzwa#} and {#Agama#} or {#Aptavacana#});
according to the Nyāya and Vaiśeṣika phil., one of the
{%four%} means for this end (see also {#pratyakza, upamAna#} and {#Sabda#}).
Inference may be, according to the definitions of Sāṅkhya
and Nyāya philosophers, either one by induction ({#pUrvavat#})
e. g. that it will rain because clouds have gathered, or one
by analogy ({#sAmAnyato dfzwam#}), e. g. that moon and stars are
locomotive because they change their place and that a person
therefore who changes his place is locomotive; or one by ne-
cessity ({#Sezavat#}), e. g. that the ocean will be salt, because a
drop taken from it, is salt. According to the Vaiśeṣika
philosophers, inference may be either purely consecutive or
positive ({#kevalAnvayin#}), i. e. when the major term is not
excluded by any other notion (comp. {#anupasaMhArin#}), e. g.
all that can be known can be named, because only positive
(not negative instances) can be alleged to prove the asser-
tion; or purely exclusive or negative ({#kevalavyatirekin#}), i. e.
when only negative proof can be adduced, e. g. in asserting
that earth is distinguished from all the other elements, be-
cause it is possessed of the quality of smell, for the ar-
gument would be that all that is not distinguished from
all the other elements, is not possessed of the quality of
[Page098-b+ 56]
smell; or positive and negative ({#anvayavyatirekin#}), i. e.
when there exist positive and negative instances of the major
term, e. g. where there is fire there is smoke, because the
positive argument would be ‘on the hearth’ and the negative
‘in the lake’. (The Mīmānsā and Vedānta philosophies do
not discuss these topics, as inference is not considered by
them to be a means of arriving at true knowledge.) <sup>2</sup> (In
rhetoric.) A logical anakolouthon by the way of inference,
an {#alaMkAra#} or mode of writing elegantly, e. g. ‘wherever
falls the look of woman, there fall sharpened arrows; I

shooting off his arrows’. E. {#mA#} with {#anu,#} kṛt aff. {#lyuw#}.

<L>3331<pc>102-b<k1>anuvAda<k2>anuvAda
{#anuvAda#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-daH#}) <sup>1</sup> Reference or referring to what
has been previously said, not in the way of a mere repetition
or tautology, but in that of explanation, detailed comment
or emphasis; explanatory and corroborative reference, ex-
planation; e. g. {#BUpariDimAnAnuvAdaH#} ‘a detailed explanation
with reference to the measure of the earth's circumference
(mentioned before in the Golādhyāya)’; or, in Manu 2. 53.
the words {#KAni saMspfSet#} are an {#anuvAda#} to {#nivedya#} &c. 2. 51.,
because they give a detailed illustration of the general in-
junction contained in the latter verse. If a word is repeated
or an expression used which would seem superfluous, be-
cause not conveying a new notion, such repeated word or
[Page103-a+ 56]
such expression is {#anuvAda,#} provided a certain purpose be
connected with it, otherwise it would be simply {#punarukta#} or
a meaningless tautology, e. g. {#Gawo GawaH#} or {#GawaH kalasaH#} ‘a
jar is a jar’ would be a {#punarukta;#} but the repetition of {#paSyet#}
in Yājnav. 2. 1. from 1. 359. is an {#anuvAdaH#} because it points
to the connexion between both passages and to the detail
which is to follow as an illustration of 1. 359.; or in Manu
1. 72. {#parisaMKyayA#} might be taken as an {#anuvAda#} to {#sahasraM,#}
because it imparts greater emphasis to the bare numeral.
<sup>2</sup> In the ritual literature {#anuvAda#} designates those passages
of the Brāhmaṇa portion of the Vedas, which point to an
injunction given before ({#viDi#} q. v.) and illustrate it by the
way of comment, or by entering into greater detail, or by
adding supplementary rules, but without stating the purpose
of the injunction itself as the latter would be the object of
the {#arTavAda#} (q. v.); the {#anuvAda#} being accessory, therefore,
to the {#viDi#} portion of the Brāhmaṇa and precluded from
giving independent regulations, the supplementary rites they
contain are not considered of equal weight and as absolute
as those of the {#viDi;#} there exists however sometimes a
difficulty to decide whether a passage of the Brāhmaṇas is
{#viDi#} or {#anuvAda,#} or in other words whether its injunctions
are absolute or not, as appears from the discussion of the
Mīmānsists. (The Nyāya, supported by the commentaries
on the Mīmānsā, distribute the text of the Brāhmaṇa under
the three heads of {#viDi, anuvAda#} and {#arTavAda#} qq. vv.; a
later division makes {#anuvAda#} one of the three categories
of the {#arTavAda#}.) <sup>3</sup> Report, e. g. {#kutsitArTAnuvAdaH#}. <sup>4</sup> Abuse,
reviling (? this meaning is given by several dictionaries on
the authority of the Śabdaratnāvalī, but, to judge from
the Mss. at my disposal, it would seem to proceed from
another reading or from a misunderstanding of the passage
of this work which contains the synonymes of ‘rumour’:
{#yaTArTAniScitA vArttA BavetsarvajanAtmikA . kutsitArTAnuvAdo#}

of 32 syllables and, in the Vedas, is regulated by the number
of syllables only, in classical poetry by number and quantity.
In the Vedas the 32 syllables are distributed either in Te-
trastichs of 8 syllables in each line, or in Triplets of either
12 + 8 + 12 or 12 + 12 + 8 or 8 + 12 + 12 syllables. For the
varieties of the Anuṣṭubh in the classical poetry see {#citra-#}

{#RikA#} or {#nagasvarUpiRI#} or {#matallikA, samAnikA#} or {#mallikA,#}
{#vitAna, tuNgA, kamala, haMsapadI, mAtaNgI, ramBA#} and the metre
which is most in use but the quantity of which is not so in-
variable as that of the named varieties viz. the {#Sloka#}. In a
vaidik hymn the Anuṣṭubh is represented as one of the
primitive creations, that originated together with the moon;
according to some Purāṇas it was created from the northern
mouth of the four-headed Brahman (m.) together with the
Atharvaveda, a portion of the Sāmaveda and some hymns
as well as the Āptoryāma portion of the Jyotiṣṭoma sacri-
fice; accord. to another Purāṇa from the tendons of Brahman.

classical instrum. {#anuzwuBA;#} but {#anuzwyA#} is probably an er-
roneous reading for {#anuzwyA#} q. v.) E. {#stuB#} with {#anu,#} kṛt

<L>3495<pc>108-b<k1>anusvAra<k2>anusvAra
{#anusvAra#}¦ Tatpur. m. ({#-raH#}) (In Grammar.) Literally, an after-
sound; the name of a nasal sound which always belongs to
the preceding vowel and according to some is weaker, ac-
cording to others stronger than the {#anunAsika#} q. v. In
writing it is marked by a dot over the vowel after which
it sounds. It shares in the nature as well of consonants as
of vowels: of consonants, in as much as it has but half a
measure of time (or {#mAtrA#}) and with another consonant
makes position: of vowels, by having their properties of
shortness, length, {#pluti#} q. v., and of being capable of ac-
centuation. (The vaidik grammarians call the consonants
and the Anusvāra the ‘body of a syllable’--{#akzarANga#}--.)
On account of the organ of speech with which it is pro-
nounced it belongs to the {#nAsikya#} q. v., and on account of
the mode in which it is uttered to the {#Uzman#} q. v. (see also
{#mahAprARa#}). If a combined consonant follows an Anusvāra
the vaidik grammarians want the first consonant of the group
to be repeated; e. g. {#somAnaM ssvaraRaM#} &c. instead of {#somAnaM#}
{#svaraRaM#} &c.; this rule, however, is neglected in most of our
vaidik Mss. and in all referring to the post-vaidik literature,
although the injunction of the grammarians is doubtless
founded on correct physiological observation and the system
of Sanskrit orthography on a correct imitation in writing
the spoken sound.--At the end of a {#pada#} (q. v.) Anu-
svāra is a substitute for {#m,#} in the middle of a {#pada#} that of
{#m#} or {#n;#} at the end of a {#pada#} it is only allowed to occur
when the {#pada#} does not stand in a pause, and in the middle
not before any other sound than {#S, z, sa#} and {#h,#} before
which it is the compulsory substitute. (These rules, too,
are frequently neglected in spite of the grammatical author-
ities.) It is compulsory, too, at the end of the {#pada,#} before
the same letters and {#r#} save a few exceptions as {#samrAj#} or
when {#h#} is followed by {#m, n#} &c., e. g. {#kiM hmalayati#} or
{#kimhmalayati, kiM hnute#} or {#kinhnute#} &c. For the interchange
and the confusion, that prevails in the classical literature,
between the use of Anusvāra and Anunāsika before {#y,#}
{#l, v#} see s. v. {#anunAsika#}.--A short syllable followed
by Anusvāra (which itself as results from the preceding
statement must always be followed by a consonant) becomes
of the nature of a long syllable, i. e. it becomes {#guru#} or
heavy; but though this is the constant case in the Vedas
[Page109-a+ 56]
and generally in the later literature, it will seem that this rule
may be departed from at the end of a Pāda, as in the instance
of the following first Pāda of the Āryā verse: {#aTa lulitapa-#}
{#tatrimAlaM rugnAsanavARakeSaratamAlam#} &c. where {#trimAlaM#} counts

compound {#vimalopalameKalAntAH#} is explained by the comm.
on the authority of the Śabdārṇava {#antAH = ramyAH;#} yet
as this meaning admits of no connexion with any of the
other meanings of {#anta,#} it seems preferable to analyze the
compound in {#°meKalA-AntAH,#} when {#Anta#} could be taken
as the participle (comp. Pāṇini VII. 2. 28.) of {#am ‘saMBaktO’#} in
the sense of {#Bakta#} ‘attached, served’; and this interpretation
is the more probable, as the verse in question exhibits a
permanent punning on words which either may be applied
to women or to objects of nature, and as {#Anta#} would then
correspond with {#Bajanti#} in the next line. E. {#am,#} uṇ. aff.
{#tan#} or according to others, from {#ant,#} kṛt aff. {#ac#} or {#GaY#}.
Both etym. are not satisfactory; perhaps the origin of {#anta#}

sense (also called {#AByantarakaraRa#}) opposed to the {#vAhyakaraRa#}
(q. v.) or exterior sense; this notion which in general may
be termed {%‘the faculty of thinking’%} is thus modified in the
Vedānta and in the Sāṅkhya: <sup>a</sup> (In the Vedānta it implies)
the notion of what is the general substratum of {#Atman#} or
Soul (Śaṅkara: {#taccAtmana upADiBUtamantaHkaraRam#}); its activity
becomes manifest in two of the seventeen {#sUkzmaSarIra#} (q. v.)
or subtle bodies of creation, viz. in the {#budDi#} (q. v.) or that
mental activity which forms positive conclusions, and in
the {#manas,#} or that mental activity which ‘discerns and doubts’;
[Page115-a+ 56]
and as {#citta#} or ‘logical combination’ is involved by the
activity of {#budDi,#} and {#ahaNkAra#} or ‘self-consciousness’ is in-
volved by {#manas,#} the activity of the {#antaHkaraRa#} is fourfold,
viz. as that of {#budDi, manas, citta#} and {#ahaNkAra#}. Śaṅkara in
his commentary on the Vedānta Sūtras varies slightly in this
respect by substituting {#vijYAna#} for {#ahaNkAra;#} the difference
however is merely apparent, {#vijYAna,#} worldly knowledge,
being also one of the attributes of {#manas#} (Śaṅkara: {#‘antaH-#}
{#karaRaM mano budDirvijYAnaM cittamiti cAnekaDA tatra tatrABi-#}
{#lapyate’#}). <sup>b.</sup> (In the Sāṅkhya it is not the substratum of {#puruza#}
or Soul but) the generic name and characteristic of three
successive productions of {#prakfti#} or Matter, viz. of {#budDi#} ‘as-
certainment or positive conclusion’, of its product {#ahaNkAra#}
self-consciousness’ and of the product of Ahaṅkāra, viz.
{#manas#} which in this philosophy means ‘an organ both of sen-
sation and of action’ (see {#budDIndriya#} and {#karmendriya#}), ‘the
organ of volition’ (see {#saNkalpa#}). ‘The ten external organs

supply the objects for the ‘interior sense’, their time is the
present time, while the interior sense embraces the past,
present and future time’. <sup>2</sup> (In the non-philosophical lite-

{#antar#}¦ ind. (see {#nipAta, gati, upasarga#}). A particle implying
<sup>1</sup> within, in the middle, <sup>2</sup> between, <sup>3</sup> under, in its literal and
metaphorical acceptations. It is used either adverbially or as
a separable preposition or as a prefix to verbs and occurs
also, but seldom, in the sense of a noun. With nouns, if
preceding them it may form Tatpur., Bahuvr. and Avyayībh.,
if following them indecl. Tatpur. compounds. It means:
<div n="P">I. (if used adverbially) <sup>1</sup> In the middle, within; mostly
followed or preceded by a noun in the locat.; e. g. {#apsvanta-#}
{#ramftam#}. <sup>2</sup> In the interior (said of a kingdom &c.); e. g.

enclosing or seizing, e. g. {#antarhatvA mUzikAM Syeno gataH#}

by the native Koshas when they render {#antar#} by {#svI-#}
{#kAre,#} for the Kaśikā interprets Pāṇini I. 4. 65. {#‘parigrahaH#}
{#svIkaraRam’;#} Mathureśa has probably misunderstood the
bearing of {#svIkaraRa#} when substituting for the latter word
the interpretation {#aNgIkftO#}.]
<div n="P">II. (as a separable preposition) <sup>1</sup> Within, <sup>2</sup> Between;
followed or preceded <sup>a.</sup> by the genitive, e. g. {#tasmAnnAkzyA-#}

{#antarhatya#} ‘having struck in the middle’; compare on the
contrary {#antarhatvA#} 1. 3. <sup>2</sup> Under (implying disappearance);
e. g. {#DA#} with {#antar#} to hide, to make invisible, comp. also
{#antarDi, antarDA#} &c. [The intimate relation between {#antar#}
and the radical or verb in the latter cases is indicated not
only by the influence this particle exercises on the meaning
of the radical and its derivatives, but also by the effect it
has on the formation of the gerund (comp. {#antarhatvA#} I. 4.
and {#antarhatya#} III. 1.) and by the change it may produce in
the dental {#n#} of the radical and its derivation affixes, comp.
e. g. {#antarayaRa, antarhaRana#} &c.]
<div n="P">IV. (as an indeclinable noun) <sup>1</sup> The interior, any thing
not belonging to the exterior world, e. g. {#antarvahiriti#}

terior of, in the heart of; <sup>1</sup> before the noun: <sup>a.</sup> in Tatpur., e.

seem as if the latter part depended on {#antar#} in the genitive,
e. g. {#antaHSarIra#} the interior of the body, {#antarhfdaya#} the
interior of the heart, but it is more correct to consider
these interpretations as arising from such as ‘the body
in its interior &c.’; comp. several comp. beginning with
{#agra,#} e. g. {#agranaKa, agrahasta#} &c.; the {#n#} is changed to
{#Ra#} in the Tatpur. {#antarvaRa#} and {#antarayaRa#} qq. vv.; see also

times meaning ‘from the interior’, e. g. {#antaHsuKa, antaHprajYa#}.

noun, in indecl. Tatpur., e. g. {#te nAlikerAntarapaH pibantaH;#} or

some comm. consider the former part as representing the

mean either ‘the houses in the interior of a town’, or
‘those situated outside of the town and inhabited by
Chāṇḍālas and other low-caste people’. (The apparent
contradiction between these two meanings arises from the
interpretation of {#vahiryoga#} in Pāṇ. I. 1. 36. which according

in this place to be relied upon; the meaning {#vyasana#} which

<div n="P">III. See {#antaram#} and {#antareRa#}. E. The native etym. {#anta#}

that the meanings arranged under I. 1. and II. 1. are con-
nected in origin with those of {#antar#} and the meanings under
I. 2. and II. 2. with the meanings of {#anta,#} the former in the
lineage of the notions of <sup>a.</sup> within; <sup>b.</sup> 1. in the middle,
between, 2. interval, 3. difference, 4. breach; <sup>c.</sup> under(?);
the latter in the lineage of <sup>a.</sup> end, <sup>b.</sup> proximity, <sup>c.</sup> exterior.
But in the same manner as the meanings of {#anta#} and {#antar#}
coincide in many respects (comp. also {#antarA#}) as probably
arising from the same origin, it would appear possible to
derive {#antara#} (comp. {#antama#}), as well as {#anta#} and {#antar#}
from a common source instead of assuming that {#antara#} re-
presents two etym., one from {#anta#} and another from {#antar#}
See the Preface. [In a Gaṇalist to Pāṇini, {#antara#} occurs
among the words which as latter parts form Tatpur. com-
pounds with other words depending on them in the sense
of a locative; but it seems that the reading {#antar,#} which
is given in the Ganaratnam. and exemplified in its comm.--
while only mention is made there of the reading {#antara#}--,
is preferable; see s. v. {#antar#} V. 2.]

the inward Spirit or individual Soul. In the Upanishads
the words {#puruza, Atman#} and {#antarAtman#} are often used
apparently as synonymes, but the term {#antarAtman#} is, more
especially, appropriated there to the notion of the Supreme
Soul when it resides, according to their doctrine, in the
interior of the heart, of a thumb's size ({#‘aNguzWamAtraH pu-#}
{#ruzo'ntarAtmA sadA janAnAM hfdaye saMnivizwaH’#}); [a devia-
tion, however, in this respect may be noticed in a passage
of the same Kaṭha-Upan. which contains also the preceding
quotation (viz. {#aNguzWamAtraH puruzo maDya Atmani tizWati#})
where {#puruzaH#} seems to have been considered as distinct
from {#Atman#} and not residing in the heart, although Śan-
kara endeavours to effect a reconciliation with the general
doctrine by interpreting {#Atman#} in that passage by {#SarIra#}].
--In the Vedānta the notion of the {#antarAtman#} has passed
into that of the {#jIvAtman#} q. v. In the other philosophies
the terms {#Atman#} and {#puruza,#} in the sense they assume in these
phil., have superseded the term {#antarAtman#}.--Manu uses
the word {#antarAtman#} sometimes in the general sense of {#A-#}
{#tman,#} sometimes in the special sense of {#jIvAtman#} (e. g. {#jI-#}
{#vasaMjYo'ntarAtmAnyaH sahajaH sarvadehinAm#}); Yājnavalkya, how-
ever, employs the terms {#Atman#} and {#antarAtman#} as syno-
nymes to denote the Universal Soul, while he associates

{#antarIkza#} as the primitive form and identifies {#antarIkza#} with

which coincides in some respect with that of Sāyaṇa &c.
has the most probability from the circumstance that the

pearances of a non-primitive radical (comp. {#Bikz, yakz,#}

of {#A#} to {#I,#} in the latter, would have its analogies in the
change of {#a#} and {#A#} to {#I#} under the influence of a final

of the elementary creation, that of which the coarsest sheath

truest form in which Brahman (n.) or the Supreme Soul

scious existence ({#‘ye'nnaM brahmopAsate’; ‘annaM brahmetyeka Ahu-#}

or {#sEzA virAqdaSasaMKyA satyannaM cAnnAdinI ca#}. The process of
this manifestation is thus imagined in the Taittirīya Upanishad:
in the Supreme Soul originates æther, in æther air and so
on in each preceding element successively fire, water, earth,
herbs, food, from which comes semen and man; in food
originate, too, all other creatures living on this earth ({#‘a-#}

organised form sprung forth from the heated waters, the
process of creation differing materially from that imagined

child: the seventh of the ten essential rites enjoined to the
the three first castes (see {#saMskAra#}); it ought to take place
according to Āsvālāyana, Manu, Yājnavalkya &c. in the
sixth month after a child's birth; according to Kātyāyana
and his school in the sixth (or, according to some, in the
eighth month) if the child is a boy, in the fifth or seventh,
if it is a girl. According to Āsvālāyana a father, if he
desire plenty (for his child?) ought to give it a soup or
sauce made of goat's flesh ({#‘AjamannAdyakAmaH’#}); if he de-
sire holiness, a soup or sauce made of the flesh of a fran-
coline patridge, called tittiri ({#‘tEttiraM brahmavarcasakAmaH’#}); if
he desire strength, boiled rice sprinkled over with very
little clarified butter, but not fried in butter, as it would
then not be moist ({#‘GftOdanaM tejaskAmaH’#}) [The restriction
made by the comm. in his explanation of the word {#GftOdana#}
is not justified by himself, but countenanced by the gloss of
Patanjali on a Vārttika ({#‘saMpratyayAcca tadarTADyavasAnam’#}) to
Pāṇini II. 1. 34]; or if he have no particular desire, boiled
rice mixed with curdled milk, honey and clarified butter
({#‘daDimaDuGftamiSramannaM prASayet’#}). [The word {#anna#} supplied
at {#Aja#} and {#tEttira#} is, as the comm. observes, not to be
taken there in its usual sense ‘boiled rice’ but in that of
soup or sauce, {#vyaYjana#}.] When giving the food, whatever
be its substance, the father speaks the verse: {#annapate'nnasya#}
{#no dehyanamIvasya SuzmiRaH#} &c. (Vājas. Sanh. 11. 83.), if the
child is a boy; if it is a girl, the ceremony is performed
without the recital of the mantra ({#‘AvftEva kumAryE’#}).--
According to the school of Kātyāyana the food varies still
more according to the nature of the desires: that cor-
responding with the desire of eloquence is the flesh (pro-
bably the sauce made of the flesh of) a skylark ({#BaradvAjI#});
with the desire of plenty, that of a partridge, called {#ka-#}
{#piYjala;#} with the desire of quickness that of a fish; with
the desire of long life that of the partridge called {#kfkaRA;#}
with the desire of holiness that of the Śaralī bird ({#AwI#});
with the desire of all the advantages mentioned before that
of all these animals together; the dish must moreover in
general contain honey, clarified butter and bits of gold
(Reṇuka in his Gṛhyakārikā: {#‘maDvAjyakanakopetaM sarvaM tadyuga-#}

{#Bam’#}); the ceremony is performed while a mantra is in-
audibly muttered and the child is sitting on the lap of its
mother before the divinity of the family; preparatory pro-
cedings are, according to Reṇuka, those connected with
the fixing of an auspicious day, the Ābhyudayika-śrāddha
(the same as the Vṛddhi-Śr.), austerities, as suspending
the breath, meditation on the divinity and oblations (āhutis)
with clarified butter while remembering the divine powers
of speech ({#vAc#}), the vital airs {#prARa#} and {#apAna,#} eye
({#cakzus#}) and ear ({#Srotra#}), lastly an oblation of {#caru#} (q. v.)
to Agni ({#agniH svizwakft#}).--According to Bhavadeva, as
quoted by Rādhākānta, the order of the procedings is:
fixing of an auspicious day, ablutions, performance of the
Vṛddhi-Śrāddha, collecting of the sacrificial fire, making
[Page135-b+ 56]
a heap of Kuśagrass(?) (acc. to Reṇuka: of fifty leaves of
this grass), then silently throwing into the fire a piece of
fuel smeared with clarified butter, of a span's length, then
the oblation (homa) which is accompanied with the three
sacred words bhūr, bhuvar and svar, then five oblations
(āhutis) with clarified butter, then the homa of the five vital
airs ({#prARa#}), or instead of the two latter(?) the ceremony
practised in the north which begins with the Śāṭyāyana-
homa and ends with the hymn called Vāmadevya; these
procedings are followed by the essential rite of giving the
food and by, what is essential too, the presents to the of-
ficiating priest. (Comp. also {#annaBukti#}.) E. {#anna#} and {#prASana#}.

of the essence of the elementary creation, i. e. the material
creation: the lowest form in which Brahman (n.) or the
Supreme Soul is considered as manifesting itself in its world-
ly and conscious existence.--In the Taittirīya-Upan. {#anna#}
of which the material creation is made, is the product of
herbs, these of earth and so on in retrogression, of the
elements water, fire and æther, the latter being the first
product of the Supreme Soul; it would appear therefore
that Brahman (n.) as {#annamayakoSa,#} in this Upanishad,
[Page136-a+ 56]
is the totality of the {%animal kingdom%} only, since the vegetable
kingdom precedes the creation of {#anna#} which is called also
{#sarvOzaDa#} (see {#anna#} 2. 2.) and the beings ({#prajAH#} or {#BUtAni#})
originating in {#anna,#} are represented as {%living%} through it
({#‘aTo'nenEva jIvanti’#}); but as {#anna#} on the other hand,
is the essence of the elements preceding it, this form of
Brahman would become in the Upanishad, constructively,
the same that it is in the Vedānta explicitly, viz. the to-
tality of the whole material creation. Yet while the Upa-
nishad uses the terms æther, air, fire, water and earth to
denote the elements in a general sense, the Vedānta dis-
tinguishes between ideal ({#sUkzma#}) and real ({#sTUla#}) elements
and makes the {#annamayakoSa#} proceed from the latter which
are an artificial mutual combination of portions of the former
(see {#BUta, sUkzmaBUta#} and {#sTUlaBUta#}); and while the Upanishad
contents itself with the general idea of totality, as expressed
above, the Vedānta distinguishes between the conception
that may be formed of the Supreme Soul as unity in this
totality of the material creation (comp. {#samazwi#}) and the con-
ception that may be formed of it as multiplicity in it (comp.
{#vyazwi#}); as unity it is called {#vESvAnara#} or {#virAj,#} as multi-
plicity {#viSva,#} in either case it is {#jAgrat#}.--The forms superior

The being wrongly established or the establishing wrongly,
i. e. the being referred of an effect, or the referring an effect,
to a cause which is not the true cause. This may happen
in five ways, viz. <sup>a.</sup> by taking for cause what is prior to
the effect but only accidental to the real cause ({#‘saha tena’#}),
as by taking a potter's stick for the cause of a jar; or
<sup>b.</sup> by taking for cause something inherent to what is ac-
cidental to the real cause ({#‘yasya’#}), as by taking the shape
of a potter's stick for the cause of a jar; or <sup>c.</sup> by taking
for cause what is prior but is known to be the cause of
another effect ({#‘anyaM prati’#}), as by taking æther for the cause
of a jar, æther being the known cause of sound; or <sup>d.</sup> by
taking for cause what is prior but prior in so far only as
the real cause is produced by it ({#‘janakaM prati’#}), as by tak-
ing the potter's father for the cause of a jar; or <sup>e.</sup> by taking
for cause any thing foreign to the effect ({#‘atiriktam’#}), as
by taking the donkey carrying the earth of which the jar is
made, for the cause of the jar. The last error comprises,
indeed, in its generality all the preceding and is therefore
called {#‘AvaSyaka’,#} the absolute error. E. {#anyaTA#} and {#sidDi#}.

ceased to be a virgin before the nuptial ceremonies, or she
had remained a virgin and become blemished through the
repeated celebration of the marriage ceremonies; she is
{#svEriRI#} or licentious, if she leaves her husband and goes,
out of lust, to a man of the same caste. A woman, how-
ever, is not considered to be a {#punarBU,#} if she is left without
a son and, by order of her Guru, is approached, for the
sake of getting a son, by her brother-in-law, or a relative
of the class of the Sapiṇḍas or a man of the same Gotra,

band for another man; Nārada uses the synonymous term
{#parapUrvA#} in a similar manner as the Mitākṣara {#anyapUrvA,#} but
divides the {#punarBU#} into three and the {#svEriRI#} into four cate-
gories; for according to him a {#punarBU#} may be either a virgin-
woman who is blemished by having gone through the mar-
riage ceremonies for a second time, or a woman who first
has been given to one and then on account of her love, to
another, or a woman who, in want of a brother-in-law,
is given by her relations to a Sapiṇḍa-relative of the same
caste; a {#svEriRI#} a woman, whether having had children or
[Page145-a+ 56]
not, who, while her husband is alive, goes to another from
lust, or a woman who leaves her infant husband for another
man and later returns to the house of her husband; or a
woman who after the death of her husband slights her brother-
in-law and the other relations (she may approach) and goes
from lust to another man, or lastly, a woman who has come
from the country and, purchased with money, under the
pressure of hunger and thirst gives herself up to another

e. g. {#anyonyena kftam;#} or {#anyonyasmE dattam;#} or {#anyonyezAM pu-#}
{#zkarErAmfSanto dAnodBedAduccakErBugnavAlAH;#} or as an attribute
of a neuter {#prItyaprItivizAdAdyErguRAnAmanyonyaM vEDarmyam;#} and
the same must be observed of all the words in which {#anyonya#}
is the first part of a compound; comp. e. g. the following
articles and {#anyonyatas#}. <sup>d.</sup> {#anyonyam#} is frequently used ad-
verbially, e. g. {#yadyapyAtmanAmanyonyaM BedavAkyavadaBedavAkyAnyapi#}
{#santi taTApi nAdvEtaM nAtyantamaBedaH.--anyonyam#} or {#anyonyAm#}
are used optionally in the sense of an accusative, if the
subject to which they refer is either a feminine or a neuter;
e. g. {#anyonyamime brAhmaRyO BojayataH#} or--{#anyonyAM BojayataH;#}
{#anyonyamime brAhmaRakule BojayataH#} or--{#anyonyAM BojayataH;#}
these are the instances given by Patanjali on the Vārttika
12 to Pāṇ. VIII. 1. 12, and because they show either word
as representing in meaning the accus. of {#anyonya,#} some
grammarians (‘of the East’, according to the Prauḍhama-
noramā on the same rule) contend that the option is re-
stricted to the meaning of this case, but that {#anyonyam#} alone
is admissible when expressing adverbially the sense of the
other cases. Others, on the contrary, maintain that the quoted
words are intended by Patanjali merely as an instance and
that the option extends also to sentences in which {#anyonyam#}
would imply the sense of an instrumental &c. Bhaṭṭoji, re-
ferring in the Siddh. Kaum. on the quoted rule to Patanjali's
gloss on the 5th Bhāṣyakārikā to Pāṇ. IV. 1. 3, sides with
the former opinion. (Prauḍham. {#yadapi tftIyAdizu puMvaditi#}

Jayamangala, however (in the printed ed. of the Bhaṭṭikāvya)
differs materially from either of the quoted authorities; for in
his comment on Bhaṭṭik. 8. 6. he not merely quotes apparently
a Vārttika which varies in important points from that of Pa-
tanjali, but justifies {#anyonyam#} of the text by adding: {#strInapuM-#}
{#sakayorAmaBAva iti vaktavyam#} ‘if the subject is a feminine or a
neuter, the form {#anyonyAm#} is not admissible’ (the subject of
the commented sentence being {#udanvAn#} and the femin. {#rA-#}
{#kzasI#}); yet the correctness of the printed text alluded to is
very doubtful; for the E. I. H. Ms. 544 reads this comm. thus:
{#anyonyamityAdi . anyonyamityasyetyarTaH . karmavyatIhAre sarvanA-#}
{#mnI dvirBavataH . samAsavacca bahulam . yadA samAsavattadA pUrvapa-#}
{#dasya praTamEkavacanam . uttarapadasyAmBAva iti vAcyam . anyo-#}
{#nyasaMbanDiBiH SabdEH#} &c. &c. (Comp. also the comm. on Bhaṭṭ.
1. 21.)--As regards the classical literature there can be no
doubt that the adverbial use of {#anyonyam#} prevails almost ex-
clusively over that of {#anyonyAm#}. <sup>e.</sup> The Gaṇaratnamaho-
dadhi (which mentions {#anyonya#} among the {#sarvanAman#} q. v.) gives
{#anyonyasya#} in the Gaṇa {#cAdi,#} imparting to the genitive the
value of an adverb or that of {#anyonyam;#} but the instance,
Vardhamāna gives in his comm. on this work, {#‘anyonyasya#}
{#smaranti’#} is not happy, as the genitive could be the legitimate
government of {#smaranti; ‘anyonyasya Bojayanti’,#} the instance
of the Kāśikā to Pāṇ. VIII. 1. 12. Vārtt. 11; {#‘anyonyasya vya-#}
{#tipunanti’#} of Patanjali to Pāṇ. III. 1. 16. and {#‘anyonyasya#}
{#vyatilunanti’#} of the Kāś. to the same rule, seem more to the
purpose; but the occurence of the genitive in the sense of
other cases is, in general, rare.--Comp. {#itaretara#} and {#paraspara#}.
<div n="P">2. n. ({#-nyam#}) (In Rhetoric.) An {#alaMkAra#} q. v. or mode
of elegant expression; viz. conveying the mutual relation
or intimacy of two objects by representing them as the
mutual cause of the same action ({#‘arTayorekakriyAmuKena#}
{#parasparaM kAraRatve satyanyonyaM nAmAlaMkAraH’#}), e. g. ‘she shineth
through thee and thou shinest through her, like as the
moon shineth through the night and the night shineth through
the moon’. E. {#anyas#} and {#anya#}. [The oldest grammatical
authorities do not consider {#anyonya#} as a compound, but
take {#anyonyena#} and other cases as consisting of the two dis-
tinct words: the nomin. of {#anya#} and the instrum. of {#anya#}
&c.; see Vārtt. 11 to Pāṇ. VIII. 1. 12. and the remark of
Kaiyyaṭa: {#tatra bahulagrahaRAdanyonyaSabde samAsavadBAvABAvA-#}
{#tsubluNga Bavati . nApi samAsAntodAttatvamityAmreqitAnudA-#}
{#ttatvaM Bavati#} (comp. Pāṇ. VIII. 1. 3); but it results from the
foregoing statement that this etym. cannot be entertained.
Jayamangala on the Bhaṭṭikāvya 17. 8. appears to consider
{#anyonya#} not as a Tatpur., but as Karmadh. (in explaining
{#anyonyam#} by {#‘anyasya anyasya’#}), probably in thinking of Pāṇ.
VIII. 1. 11. which applies to VIII. 1. 12; but the possibility
of this application is removed by the quoted words of
Kaiyyaṭa and by the general remark he appends to the
Vārttikas of VIII. 1. 12, viz. {#vArtikezu karmaDArayavaditi na#}
{#saMbaDyata iti sublopAdi na Bavati#}. A modern theory takes
{#anyonya#} for a compound (it does not say which), but calls
[Page149-a+ 56]
the former part of this word a ‘benumbed’ nominative. It
seems, however, that the sense and accent of the word (it is
udātta on the second syllable) decide in the first place for
its being a Tatpur., and secondly its form, that it belongs
to that class of compounds in which the former part has
received a further developement by means of an affix {#s,#}
the function of which {#s#} apparently consists in producing a
stronger relation between the two parts of the compound and
consequently a more intense unity of notion, than would be
expressed without this {#s;#} comp. e. g. the derivatives of
{#sam-kf#} and {#saMs-kf, pari-kf#} and {#pariz-kf, apa-kF#} and {#apas-#}
{#kF; A-carya#} and {#AS-carya, apa-kara#} and {#apas-kara#} &c. and
such words as {#hariS-candra, ajas-tunda, bfhas-pati, prAyaS-#}
{#citti#} &c. &c. (comp. Pāṇ. VI. 1. 135-157.) which resemble closely
in formation {#anyo'nya#} (and the synon. {#paraspara#}); the accent of
this word would then fall under the category of Pāṇ. VI. 2. 2.]

uses of the form {#anvaci#} which has the value there of a

But as Pāṇini expresses himself in a similar manner when
speaking of {#tiryac#} III. 4. 60. {#‘tiryacyapavarge’#}--when he in-
curs a like remark from Patanjali--, it is perhaps more
just to say that he did not intend to speak in these rules
of the declinable {#anvac#} and {#tiryac,#} but of their neuters
become indeclinable; and that, his method requiring in these
rules the locative of the mentioned words, {#anvaci#} and {#ti-#}
{#ryaci#} were less objectionable than {#anvaki#} and {#tiryaki,#} while
{#anUci#} and {#tiraSci,#} as suggested by Patanjali, would not
have necessarily conveyed the notion of indeclinable words.]

as property ‘which is received by a woman, after marriage,
from the family of her husband or from her own relatives’
(i. e. from her maternal uncle &c., according to Viṣṇu,
or from the relatives of her parents, as the author of
the Dāyabhāga interprets the latter word). [{#kAtyAyanaH .#}

ferable as it occurs in several Mss. (E. I. H.) of this work,
in Kullūka on Manu 9. 195 (with the v. 1. {#banDukule taTA#}), in two
passages of the Dāyabhāga (pp. 116 and 149) with the com-

is: {#banDukulAdityatra banDupadena mAtApitrorupalakzaRam#}. In the
Vivādachintāmaṇi p. 139 the latter half of the verse reads
thus: {#anvADeyaM tu tatproktaM yallabDaM svakulAttaTA#}.] {%Bhṛgu%} defines
this property as ‘whatever is received with pleasure by a
woman, after the marriage ceremony, from her husband and
her parents’ [{#UrDvaM labDaM tu yatkiMcitsaMskArAtprItitaH striyA .#}

after ‘her parents’: ‘and from those related to her through
her parents, i. e. grandparents &c.’, so as to effectuate a con-

{#ap#}¦ f. ({#-p;#} in the classical literature only used in the plural:
{#-ApaH-apaH-adBiH-adByaH-apAm-apsu#}) <sup>1</sup> Water.--Ac-
cording to the Hindu doctrine it is one of the five elements
the several denominations of which are {#AkASa#} (æther),
{#vAyu#} (air), {#agni#} (fire), {#ap#} (water), {#pfTivI#} (earth), (each
of these being also replaced by synonymes, as {#AkASa#}
by {#vyoman, vAyu#} by {#marut, agni#} by {#tejas, ap#} by
{#vAri, pfTivI#} by {#kziti#} &c.; comp. under {#AkASa#} &c.); the
place, however, which {%water%} holds in the Hindu cosmogony
varies according to the doctrines. Thus the {%Bṛhad-Āraṇ-%}
{%yaka Upan.%} represents it as the first material creation, it
being produced by Death after the creation of Soul; but
its character in this Upanishad is not yet that of an element
in the later sense of the word; nor is it such an element in
the {%Aitareya-Upan.,%} where the order of the primitive ma-
terial creation is {#amBas#} (the waters above the heavens),
{#marIci#} (the sphere of sunbeams or atmosphere), {#mara#} (the
sphere of death or earth) and {#ap#} (the sphere of waters
beneath the earth).--In the {%Taittirīya-Upan.%} the order and
successive origin of the elements is the same as in the Ve-
dānta, viz. æther, in which originates air and thus suc-
cessively fire, water, earth. But the {%Vedānta%} complicates
this simple view by assuming a creation of subtle elements
(see {#sUkzmaSarIra#}) æther &c., produced by Chaitanya or the
worldly Brahman, whence arise through an intricate division
and combination of the several parts of each, the material
elements (see {#sTUlaSarIra#}) æther &c.; this system holds more-
over that each successive element becomes possessed of the
qualities of each preceding one, i. e. the quality of æther
being sound, air obtains the qualities of sound and touch,
and in a similar progress, fire the qualities of sound, touch
and form, water of sound, touch, form and savour, earth
of sound, touch, form, savour and odour.--According to
the {%Sāṅkhya%} the coarse elements also arise from subtle ele-
ments, but the latter ({#tanmAtra#} q. v.), produced by Ahaṅkāra
or the type of {%I,%} are the qualities sound, touch, form,
savour and odour, æther proceeding from sound, air from
touch, fire from form, water from savour and earth from
odour. (Compare also Suśruta's mythological developement
of the Sāṅkhya-Yoga: {#avyaktaM mahAnahaMkAraH paYca tanmAtrARi ce-#}
{#tyazwO prakftayaH SezAH zoqaSa vikArAH . svaH svaScEzAM vizayo'Di-#}
{#BUtam . svayamaDyAtmamaDidEvataM ca . aTa budDerbrahmA . ahaMkArasye-#}
{#SvaraH . manasaScandramAH . diSaH Srotrasya . tvaco vAyuH . sUryaScakzu-#}
{#zoH . rasanasyApaH . pfTivI GrARasya .#} &c.)--The {%Nyāya%}
systems, more especially the {%Vaiśeṣika,%} do not discuss the
origin of these elements, the order of which they retain,
[Page156-a+ 56]
but attach themselves chiefly to the definition of their
properties; accord. to the {%Vaiśeṣika%} the qualities of water
are touch, number, quantity, individuality, conjunction, dis-
junction, greater or less comprehensiveness (extension), ve-
locity, gravity, fluidity, colour, savour and viscidity. (For
those of the other elements see s. vv. {#AkASa#} &c.) The cos-
mogony of {%Manu%} which is neither the pure Sāṅkhya nor the
pure Vedānta doctrine (although Kullūka endeavours to ex-
plain his terms as if they were pure Vedānta terms), but
a theory apparently prior to both and combining their views,
imagines the coarse elements as proceeding from the subtle
portions of the seven intellectual creations--{#puruzAH#} which
are, according to Kullūka, {#ahaMkAra, mahat#} and the five
subtle elements(?)--and endowed with the same qualities
as assigned to them by the Vedānta.--According to the
{%Viṣṇupurāṇa%} ‘elementary Egotism (the type of {%I,%} {#ahaMkAra#})
becoming productive as the rudiment of sound, produced
from it æther, of which sound is the characteristic, invest-
ing it with its rudiment of sound; æther becoming produc-
tive, engendered the rudiment of touch; whence originated
strong wind, the property of which is touch; and æther
with the rudiment of sound, enveloped the rudiment of
touch; then wind becoming productive, produced the rudi-
ment of form (colour); whence fire proceeded of which form
is the attribute, and the rudiment of touch enveloped the
wind with the rudiment of colour; fire becoming productive
produced the rudiment of savour, whence proceed all juices
in which savour resides, and the rudiment of colour invested
the juices with the rudiment of savour; the waters becoming
productive engendered the rudiment of smell; whence an
aggregate (earth) originates, of which smell is the property.’
In a note to this passage ({%Viṣṇup.%} p. 16) Professor Wilson
observes that ‘the successive series of rudiments and ele-
ments and their respectively engendering the rudiments and
elements next in order occur in most of the Purāṇas in
nearly the same words’, that ‘some of the Purāṇas, as the
{%Matsya, Vāyu, Linga, Bhāgavata%} and {%Mārkaṇḍeya%} add a
description of a participation of properties amongst the ele-
ments, which is rather Vedānta than Sāṅkhya’ and mentions
a passage of the Moksha Dharma (vv. 6778. 6779) of the
Māhābhārata which is an exception, since its order of the
elements is æther, water, fire, air, earth. [On the cosmo-
gony of the chapter in which these latter verses occur, Arju-
namiśra has the following gloss: {#ko'yaM sargaprakAraH . na hi#}
{#sANKyAdisargezvayaM kramaH . ucyate . anyo'yaM prakAraH sargasya .#}
{#pOrARikAdisaMmatezu#} &c.; but he omits to say which Pu-
rāṇas give this anomalous order of the elements.] For the
Bhāgav. Pur. comp. III. 26. 29. ff. and the two verses VII.

{#apsu kzitimapo jyotizyado vAyO naBasyamum . kUwasTe tacca ma-#}
{#hati tadavyakte'kzare ca tat#} (this reverted order being that in
which dissolution takes place).--In the Vedas, however,
{#apAM garBaH#} ‘the child of the waters’ is an epithet of Agni,

he resides as lightning amidst the rain-waters’ (according to

when connected with verbs), or as a separable preposition,
or in the Vedas sometimes also adverbially. With nouns it

{#yase yena tatpadaM na vidyate yasyAH sA tvamapadasi#}--; but ac-
cording to this gloss {#apad#} would be a Bahuvr., while its
accent--the udātta on the first syllable--assigns it to

preferable: {#avidyamAnaM padaM yena padyase sA tvamapadasi#} ‘thou
art {#apad#} because thou goest on a road which does not
exist or which is unknown’.--In no case can the word

{#gamizyAmi tridaSendraM sahAmaram .; aparA saMDyA,#} the evening-

this sense the word may be the first part of Karmadh. com-
pounds, e. g. {#aparapakza#} q. v.--{#aparam#} is used adv. in the sense
‘further, moreover’ to connect different sentences; for its
sense ‘in future’ see I. 3. 2. and compare {#aparI#}. Comp.

{#kIrtitastriviDastveza#} (viz. {#saMyogaH#}) {#Adyo'nyatarakarmajaH . ta-#}
{#ToBayakriyAjanyo BavetsaMyogajo'paraH ..#}. In this sense it
[Page166-a+ 56]
may form with a noun depending on it in the genitive a
Tatpur. (not a Karmadh.) compound of which it is the
former part; e. g. {#aparakAya,#} the hind part of the body {#(=#}
{#aparaM kAyasya); apararAtra,#} the last part of the night; {#apa-#}
{#rAhla,#} the last part of the day qq. vv.; if the latter part of such
a compound is a name of a season and a derivative is formed
of it by means of a taddh. aff. which has a {#Y, R#} or {#k#}
as anubandha, the first syllable of this latter part receives
Vṛddhi, not that of {#apara;#} thus from {#aparavarzA,#} the last
part of the rainy season, comes {#aparavArzika#} (taddh. aff.
{#Wak#}); from {#aparahemanta#} comes {#aparahEmana#} (taddh. aff. {#aR#});
from {#aparanidAGa, aparanEdAGa#} (taddh. aff. {#aR#}) &c. qq. vv.
<sup>4</sup> Western (opp. to {#pUrva#} eastern); in this sense it may be
the first part of Karmadh. compounds, <sup>a.</sup> if the com-
pound expresses a conventional term (e. g. a proper name);
e. g. {#aparezukAmaSamI, aparapARinIya#} qq. vv.; such compounds
have the udātta accent on the third syllable, if the latter part
is the name of a village, a country, a legend, or the word
{#cAnarAwa,#} or if it implies the meaning pupil, being itself a
derivative of the name of a teacher; if the latter part of such
a compound is the name of a country--except {#madra#}--or that
of a village or town of an eastern country and a derivative
is formed of it by means of a taddh. aff. which has a {#Y, R#}
or {#k#} as anubandha, the first syllable of this latter part re-
ceives Vṛddhi, not that of {#apara,#} e. g. {#aparapAYcAlaka#} (from
{#aparapaYcAla,#} taddh. aff. {#vuY#})--but {#Aparamadra#} (from {#apara-#}
{#madra,#} taddh. aff. {#aY#})--, {#aparEzukAmaSama#} (from {#aparezukA-#}
{#maSamI,#} taddh. aff. {#aR#}), {#aparakArzRamfttika#} (from {#aparakf-#}
{#zRamfttikA,#} taddh. aff. {#aR#}) qq. vv. &c.; such derivatives
have the udātta accent on the third syllable; <sup>b.</sup> if a de-
rivative is to be made of such a compound by means of a
taddh. aff.; e. g. {#apara#} and {#SAlA#} become {#aparaSAlA,#} the
western hall, for the sake of deriving {#AparaSAla;#} or <sup>c.</sup> if
such a compound is to become the former part of a com-
pound; e. g. if {#apara#} and {#SAlA#} are to form a Bahuvr. with
{#priya (aparaSAlApriya);#} otherwise {#apara#} (western) is not al-
lowed to form a Karmadh. with another noun.--The in-
strum. {#apareRa#} q. v. (which however is considered by {%Pāṇ.%} as
a deriv. of {#apara#} by means of a taddh. aff. {#enap#}) governs in
the sense ‘western of’ and with the implied sense ‘not far,
near’ the accus. or genit., e. g. {#apareRa grAmam#} or {#grAmasya;#} it is
used then in the sense of the nom., viz. ‘the western region
which is near’, or in that of the locat., viz. ‘in the near west’.
[The notion ‘western’--as has been observed already by
{%Wilson%}--is derived from the meaning ‘behind’, as that of
{#pUrva#} ‘eastern’ from its meaning ‘before’; comp. Viṣṇup.
p. 219, note 7.] Comp. {#avara#}. <sup>5</sup> Other (in general), different,
opposed; used in this sense in the same manner as {#anya;#} e. g.
{#mAtaraM BrAtaraM jyezWaM kanizWamaparAnapi . parityajeta ko nvadya#} &c.;

other) the correlative term is {#apara#} or {#eka, anya, kiMcit,#}
{#kiMcana;#} e. g. of two: {#cAturBOtikamityeke . ekaBOtikamityapare;#}

tions of the correlative terms vary according to the authors,
but the last term is usually {#apara#}). Sometimes {#apara#} is also
opposed to {#sva#} ‘own’, when it assumes the sense of {%‘foreign,%}
{%not belonging to one's self’,%} e. g. {#samIhitaM tasya nAcetansve#}
{#na cApare#} (comm.: {#sve AtmIyAH…apare parakIyAH#}).--
In this sense (5.) the word may form Karmadh. compounds
of which it is the first part; e. g. {#aparapuruza, aparADyApaka#} q. v.
[In the Vedas the feminine occurs also in the form {#aparI#}
with the udātta on the last syllable, although {#apara#} is other-
wise udātta on the first syllable; e. g. {#utAparIByo maGavA#}
{#vi jigye;#} the present edition of Pāṇ. IV. 1. 30. notices this
fact, but represents {#aparI#} as udātta on the first syllable;
a Ms. of the Kāśikā (E. I. H. 2440) reads in this Sūtra in-
stead of {#aparI#} the word {#avarI,#} but the instance alleged in
this Ms. is rather of doubtful correctness: {#‘avarI kanyA ma-#}

abstractly considered, perfect knowledge derived from ab-
straction, the second ({#aparA#}) is knowledge of Śābda-
brahman, of spirit as described and taught in the Vedas or
their supplementary branches’. In the same manner {#paraM#}
and {#aparaM brahma#} (of the {%Praśnopan.%}) are the ‘superior and
inferior’ i. e. the transcendental and the mundane Brahman,
[Page167-a+ 56]
the one indefinable and incomprehensible, the other the re-
verse.--In a passage of the {%Śvetāśv. Upan.%} {#brahma…#}
{#yasmAtparaM nAparamasti kiMcit,#} {%Śaṅkara%} explains {#aparam#}
{#= anyat,#} but it is more probable that the words mean:
‘than which there is nothing superior nor inferior’ and
merely express the incomparability of Brahman. <sup>2</sup> In the
{%Vaiśeṣika%} philosophy the two correlative terms {#para#} and {#apara#}
(superior and subordinate) express the notion of <sup>a.</sup> {%absolute%}
({#para#}) and {%relative%} ({#apara#}), when applied to the notion of
{#sAmAnya#} or {%generality%} ({%Bhāṣāp.%} {#sAmAnyaM dviviDaM proktaM paraM#}

be’ or ‘existence’ in general as including the notion of sub-
stance, quality and action ({#dravyAditrikavfttistu sattA parata-#}
{#yocyate#}), and {%relative%} generality to the notion ‘genus’ ({#para-#}
{#BinnA ca yA jAtiH sEvAparatayocyate#}); the notion ‘genus’
again as including substances, qualities and actions being

{#parAparatayocyate#}); <sup>b.</sup> {%more comprehensive%} ({#para#}) and {%less com-%}

more congenial with the vaidik poetry than the former, is
also given by {%Yāska.%} Comp. {#ap#} and {#apAnnaptf#}. [The word has
two accents, viz. the udātta on the second and third syllable

not a compound, but two distinct words; that it may be
analyzed so, is indubitable from passages where it occurs
e. g. in the form {#napAtamapAm#}. On the other hand it must be ob-
served that the double accent belongs also to other and similar

ten thus in the Calc. ed. of the comm. of the {%Sāṅkhya-%}
{%pravachana%} and in the E. I. H. Ms. 2668; in {%Wilson'%}s ed.
of the {%Sāṅkhya-Kārikā%} {#pArApAra#}); it is among the nine
kinds of acquiescence or {#tuzwi#} (q. v.) one of the five called
{#vAhya#} or acquiescences relating to exterior objects. [{%Wilson%}
in his comment on the Kārikā (page 155) renders the literal
meaning of this word ‘shoreless’, taking it therefore as a
Bahuvr.; but it seems to me that the compound terms of
this category, enumerated s. v. {#anuttamAmBas,#} are all Tat-
pur., the simile inhering to these terms being taken from
the notion of ‘water’ or ‘opposite shore’, and the dif-
ferent mode in which the former is expressed ({#amBas, sa-#}
{#lila, oGa, vfzwi#}) as well as the qualification conveyed by
the former part of the compound terms ({#supAra, uttamAmBas#}
&c.) being intended to express the higher or lower degree
of the various acquiescences, none of which is conducive
to final emancipation; the literal meaning of {#apAra#} would
therefore be, in my opinion, ‘a bad or undesirable opposite
shore’. In the list of {%Gaurapāda%} which differs from that of
the other comm., the correctness of the term {#sunetra#} seems
to me, for the reasons given, doubtful, unless {#netra#} is to be
connected there with the sense of {#netrI#} ‘river’.] <sup>2</sup> The re-
verse of the technical Sāṅkhya term {#pAra,#} i. e. <sup>a.</sup> non-ac-
quiescence or not being indifferent through not reflecting
that pain or trouble arises from the {%preservation%} of sensual
objects when they have been acquired; or <sup>b.</sup> non-acquiescence
[Page188-b+ 56]
through not reflecting that {%acquiring%} sensual objects causes
trouble or pain; (the term {#pAra#} being used by {%Gaurapāda%}
in the former, by {%Vāchaspati, Vijnānāchārya%} &c. in the
latter sense); it is amongst the seventeen {#budDibaDa#} or ob-

{#api#}¦ ind. (see {#nipAta, upasarga, gati, karmapravacanIya#}). A par-
ticle originally implying {%location%} and hence {%proximity,%}
which, like other particles of location, then has become
one implying {%emphasis.%} It is used, in some instances, as
a prefix to verbs, is considered in one instance as a se-
parable preposition governing a noun, but occurs more
commonly as an adverb or conjunction. It forms with a
following noun in a few instances Tatpur. and Bahuvr.
compounds. Its older form is {#pi#} (see the Preface).
<div n="P">1. (as a {%prefix to verbs%}) <sup>1</sup> On; comp. e. g. {#DA, nah,#}
{#banD#}. (In this sense it answers the cognate German or
English particle be-, as in beschlagen, bestreichen, beget,
bespeak &c., and passes, as other locative prefixes, e. g.
{#aDi,#} into the meaning of {%much, very;%} comp. e. g. {#gF#} with
{#api, apigIrRa#}.) Its older form {#pi,#} is met with esp. in
this sense; comp. e. g. {#piDAna, pinadDa#}.--Before {#vf,#} in
forms in which this radical preserves its vowel {#f,#} the final
vowel of the prefix is lengthened in the Veda; comp. {#apI-#}
{#vfta;#} equally so in the {#kvip#} derivation {#apIju#} (from {#jU#} with
{#api#}). [<sup>2</sup> In; in combination with {#as#} cl. 2. ‘to be’; in
the Vedas(?). As this radical is combined then with the
locative, its sense remaining the same as if it were not con-
nected with {#api,#} it is possible to refer {#api#} to another
word of the sentence, instead of considering it as a prefix
to {#as,#} in all instances in which the radical {#s#} of {#as#} under-
goes no change; but in combinations like {#api zyAt,#} it
would seem necessary to look upon {#api#} as upon a prefix
({#upasarga#}) if we follow {%Pāṇ.%} VIII. 3. 87. and implicitly I. 4.
96.--since {#api#} is called there {#karmapravacanIya#} in other mean-
ings than in that of location--; comp. also {%Kaiyyaṭa%} as
quoted in the following {#yaTApiSabdasya#} &c. On the other
hand, as {%Sāyaṇa%} considers also in the latter instances {#api#}
not as a prefix to {#as,#} but as referring to some other word
of the sentence, it must be said in favour of his opinion,
that the change of {#s#} to {#z#} after preceding coloured vowels
[Page191-a+ 56]
({#i, u#} &c.) takes place in many vaidik instances where it
could not be justified from {%Pāṇini'%}s rules which chiefly con-
cern the classical idiom (comp. e. g. as regards the radical
{#as#} a combination {#api zmasi#}), that consequently in {#api#}
{#zyAma#} the change of {#s#} to {#z#} might be ascribed to the in-
fluence of the ultimate vowel of the {%adverb%} {#api#} in the same
manner as in {#hi zWA#} ({%Sāyaṇa%} = {#BavaTa#}) to the {#i#} of {#hi#}. The
combination of {#api#} and {#as#} is therefore, at least, matter
of doubt, even in such cases where {#api#} immediately pre-
cedes {#as,#} and still more doubtful where it is separated
from it by other words.] <sup>3</sup> Near to, towards; comp. e. g.
{#i, gam (apiyat, apigata);#} the commentators render it
mostly in the latter instances by {#aBi#} or {#prati#}.
<div n="P">2. (as a {%separable preposition.%}) When used as such,
{#api#} is considered to have no special meaning itself and the
noun connected with, but not governed by, it in the geni-
tive is to be rendered with the ellipsis of ‘a drop, a little’;
e. g. {#sarpizo'pi syAt#} ‘there might be a drop of, or a
little, clarified butter’. [This value and use of the word
are stated on the authority of {%Patanjali%} (to {%Pāṇ.%} I. 4. 96.)

the different interpretation given to this Sūtra by the native
grammarians and perhaps, too, on behalf of the erroneous
quotation {#‘yuktapadArTe’#} made elsewhere from {%Hemach.%} and

<sup>c.</sup> that {#api#} is Karmapr. with regard to, i. e. governing, this
ellipsis, but not the genitive ({#sarpizaH#} &c.) and <sup>d.</sup> that the nomi-
native of the word supplied ({#vinduH#}) results from the reason
that the government required by the sentence overrules the
claim of the Karmapr. But however ingenious this inter-
pretation of what is, in truth, corresponding with the
French ‘du beurre’ might be, it seems clear, that {#api#}
cannot be considered, properly speaking, as a preposition
governing a noun, but that it has in the alleged instances
merely the emphatic sense or that of an expletive (see
meaning 3. I.) and that {%Pāṇini'%}s rule only intended what

words or sentences; I. {%by imparting greater power%} <sup>A.</sup> to {%one%}
word in general, esp. to {%a noun;%} it is synonymous then
with {#eva#} and placed in most instances after the word to
which it refers, but sometimes also after a word depending
on, or relating to, that to which it properly belongs, to
effectuate, as it were, at the same time a stronger relation
between both; e. g. {#nizWurASlIlatIvratvAttadapi#} (i. e. {#vAkpA-#}

{#muKyAH kapInAmapi nopajapyAH#} (where {#api#} increases the
power of {#muKyAH,#} but produces at the same time in {#muKyAH#}
{#kapInAm,#} by being placed after the latter the effect of a
stronger junction, like that of a compound {#kapimuKyAH#}).--
In the same manner as the positive power of a word, if it
implies, e. g. excellence &c., is rendered more prominent
by {#api,#} also the negative value of a word implying ne-
gation, diminution &c. becomes still more negative &c. by
the same particle; thus {#muhurtamapi#} means ‘only a moment’,
and {#na muhurtamapi#} ‘not even a moment’; e. g. {#kiM hi saMSaya-#}
{#mApanne tasminniha mayA tava . muhUrtamapyajIvantyA yannAnvezyasi rA-#}
{#Gavam;#} or {#nAhamenaM DanuzpARiM yuyutsuM samupasTitam . muhUrtamapi#}
{#paSyeyaM prahareyaM na cApyuta;#} for the same reason it imparts to

imparting greater emphasis to the verbal action it is <sup>a.</sup> a

it occurs combined with {#ayi,#} if the sentence is not com-
pleted, e. g. {#ayyapi sAhasakAriRi!#} <sup>β.</sup> more especially it
may impart to the {%imperative%} the notion of {%‘do as you please’%}
({%Pāṇ.%} in the sense of {#anvavasarga,#} the same as {#kAmakArakriyA#}
or {#kriyAkArakriyA#} of the Koshas), but rather with the
implied meaning of ‘indifference’ than with that of a ‘kind
permission’; e. g. (Sītā having told Rāvaṇa that her hus-
band will entirely destroy him, continues: {%Bhaṭṭik.%} 8. 92.)
{#api stuhyapi seDAsmAMstaTyamuktaM narASana#} ‘now do as you please:
praise us ({%comm.%} say that I have spoken properly) or retain
us: I have spoken the truth, man-eater!’; <sup>γ.</sup> to the {%potential%}
or {%conditional%} (the natural value of which moods is uncertainty
or insufficiency), it gives the notion of {%‘certainty’%} ({#‘vAQam’#}) or
of {%‘exaggerated capacity’%} ({#saMBAvane#}), then meaning {%certainly!%}
{%indeed!%} e. g. {#api kuryAt#} or {#apyaDIyIta#} ‘indeed he will do it,
certainly he will study’; or {#api droRapAkaM BuYjIta#} ‘indeed he
is capable to eat as much as a Drona full’; {#api siYcenmU-#}

perhaps a thief’; or of {%‘hope’%} ({#‘apekzAyAm’#}), e. g. {#api#}
{#gfhlIyAM vedam#} ‘I hope I mīght master the Veda’; if the
[Page192-b+ 56]
potential is used in the sense of the imperative, it may add
to it the notion of {%‘contempt’%} ({#garhA#} or {#nindA#}), e. g. {#‘api#}
{#stUyAdvfzalam’#} ‘let him be so mean as to praise a Śūdra’;

{#api siYceH kfSAnO tvaM darpaM mayyapi yo'BikaH#} ‘go (Rāvaṇa)
and throw thy manhood into the fire, as thou art (base
enough) to make love to me’; <sup>δ.</sup> when combined with the
{%present%} tense, it may impart to it the notion of ‘contempt’
({#garhA#}) and give it the value of any other tense, e. g. {#api#}
{#tatra BavAnvfzalaM yAjayati#} ‘how wrong it is that thou makest
a Śūdra perform a sacrifice’!; {#mantre jAtu vadantyajYAstvaM tA-#}
{#napyanumanyase#} ‘fools sometimes tender advice; to those thou
hast listened!’. <sup>C.</sup> To {%interrogatives%} (whether pronouns or
interrogative particles); such words (implying doubt or un-
certainty) assume with {#api#} the notion of {%indefiniteness;%}
thus {#kimapi#} means ‘some one or some thing’, {#kutrApi#} or
{#kvApi#} ‘somewhere’, {#kuto'pi#} ‘from somewhere, some-
where’, {#kadApi#} ‘some time’, {#kaTamapi#} ‘somehow’, when
{#api#} may also be added with increasing power to the in-
terrogatives which have become indefinites by means of
{#cit,#} e. g. {#kiMcidapi, kadAcidapi#} &c. in the same but a
more emphatic sense as {#kimapi, kadApi#} &c. <sup>D.</sup> To {%particles%}
or {%adverbs;%} combined with them it increases their original
power; thus {#cApi, evApi, taTApi ca, api cEva, api tu#}
(but on the contrary), {#apyuta, apyevam, nApi#} (not even), {#api#}
{#vA#} (more seldom {#vApi;#} e. g. in the {%Jaimini Sūtra:%} {#apUrve#}

{#eva#} &c. but with greater emphasis.--{#api ca#} occurs often
for the purpose of connecting sentences and verses loosely
connected, in the same sense as {#anyacca#} (see s. v. {#anya#} 1. a.);
{#api nAma#} in the beginning of sentences introduces an in-
direct question and belongs therefore to 3. I. B. a., when
{#nAma#} which is frequently the explanation of {#api#} in the com-
mentaries, might be considered as the emphatic increase of
the interrogative {#api;#} it means ‘perhaps, possibly’; e. g.
in the sentence {#tataH kapInAM saMGAtA harzAdrAGavaBUtaye…#}
{#samAjagmuH,#} the word {#rAGavaBUtaye#} is explained {#api nAma#}
{#rAGavasya saMpatsyAditi samAjagmuH;#} in the middle of sentences

{%a stronger junction or a stronger antithesis between words or%}
{%sentences;%} (when the junction or antithesis is effectuated al-
ready by other conjunctions, the addition of {#api#} falls under
the category of 3. I. D., but when used for this purpose
alone it answers) <sup>a.</sup> {%and also, moreover, besides;%} e. g. {#da-#}

{#api#} is used in this sense frequently in an elliptic manner,
to indicate the omission of a word or passage to be in-
ferred from the context and the junction with which it is in-
tended then to effectuate; e. g. in {%Pāṇini:%} {#Candasyanekamapi#}

be given out of the estate of the father; of a father who
has no {#putrikA#} in the place of a son, his own daughter (i. e.
one of the same caste) lawfully begotten must be considered
like a son (i. e. be entitled to the inheritance); the same
sense is conveyed by {%Parāśara'%}s words: {#aputrasya mftasya ku-#}

quotation of the {%Dāyakramas.%} p. 4: {#aputrasya ca svA kanyA#}
{#DarmajA putravadDaret#} (which seems to have been the reading
of {%Colebrooke%} when he translates in his Digest vol. III. p. 491.
CCCCXX: ‘and his own daughter…shall {%take%} &c.’. But
the more precise bearing of {%Devala'%}s clause is conveyed by
a verse of {%Vṛhaspati%} which is to the same effect, viz. {#sa-#}
{#dfSI sadfSenoQA sADvI SuSrUzaRe ratA . kftAkftA vAputrasya#}
{#piturDanaharI tu sA#} ({%Dāyabh.%} p. 273, {%Dāyakramas.%} p. 4, {%Vīra-%}
[Page196-b+ 56]
{%mitr.%} p. 204{%b, Colebr. Dig.%} III. p. 186. CCXXIV. 2.); for he in-
troduces there the terms {#kftA#} and {#akftA#} which apply only
to a {#putrikA#} either appointed by a plain declaration or by
an implied intention ({%Manu%} 9. 136., {%Dig.%} III. 164. CCVII) and
the author of the {%Smṛtichandrikā%} (accord. to the {%Vīramitrod.%}
p. 205 {%a%}) infers from this verse that the {#putrikA,#} whether
{#kftA#} or {#akftA,#} precedes in succession the wife of the de-
ceased, who herself precedes the daughter qualified by the four
epithets {#sadfSI…ratA,#} viz. {#sadfSI sadfSenoQeti prAkpaWitaM#}
{#vfhaspativacanaM smfticandrikAkAra itTaM vyAcaKyO . atrAdyAni#}

{#gfhlIyAt . savarRAdiviSezaRopetA tu duhitA tata UrDvamiti#}.
Now as the regular line of succession is in the first rank
a son, then on failure of him the widow, and on failure
of her the daughter &c. (comp. {%Dig.%} III. p. 489. CCCCXVII)
and as a {#putrikA#} is equal in right to a son ({%Kullūka%} on
{%Manu%} 9. 130. and comp. 9. 127.), the word {#aputrikasya#} of {%De-%}
{%vala,%} it is true, coincides in legal value with the word {#a-#}
{#putrasya#} of {%Parāśara%} &c., but on the other hand it is clear
that the former is a more precise expression than the latter,
since an {#aputrika#} will always be an {#aputra,#} but an {#aputra#}
may not be an {#aputrika#}. (The Pandit who has supplied the
notes to Colebrooke's Digest denies the necessity of the
former part of this inference (vol. III. p. 188), for a father
may, in his opinion, appoint his daughter even if he has a
son, yet his argument is not founded on the law-authorities,
but on a precedent mentioned in the {%Bhāgav. Pur.%} (4. 1. 2.)
where Manu appoints his daughter Ākūti as {#putrikA,#} when
giving her in marriage to Ruchi, although she had brothers.)
{%Jīmūtavāhana'%}s gloss is therefore not to be rendered ‘{#putrikA#}
{%means%}’, but ‘{#putrikA#} {%implies%} the meaning son’, when the
concordance between the quoted authorities becomes com-
plete. As {%Colebrooke%} has probably translated the reading
{#aputrasya ca svA kanyA#} &c., mentioned before, he has no re-
mark on the difficulty conveyed by the reading {#aputrikasya#}
(but comp. vol. III. p. 493. 1. 38 ff.).--[A conjecture has
been proposed to read {#aputrakasya#} instead of the latter
word; but as it is advanced without any argument what-
ever, and is in the teeth of {%Jīmūtavāhana'%}s gloss which is
misunderstood in rendering {#aputrika#} ‘sonless’, it seems
merely to proceed from a gratuitous trifling with the text.]

{#yAgajanyA kAcicCaktirapUrvamastu#}); if a religious act includes
one or several other acts, the unseen power which results
from the performance of the latter and which consists in
producing their relation with the former, is called {#avAnta-#}
{#rApUrva,#} while the unseen power of the superior act is called
with regard to the inferior acts {#paramApUrva#} or {#muKyApUrva#} or
{#prakftApUrva#} or {#praDAnApUrva#}. That unseen power which is only
the result of performing the principal sacrifices, such as
the Jyotiṣṭoma or the Darśapūrṇamāsa, and which con-
sists in producing {%the%} result, i. e. {%swarga%} or the enjoyment
of heaven, is called {#PalApUrva#}. Since such acts include other
acts which vary in degree or importance, there are various
degrees of the {#apUrva#} with regard to the {#PalApUrva,#} viz. the
{#samudAyApUrva,#} the {#utpattyapUrva#} and the {#aNgApUrva#} (the latter also
called {#kalApUrva#}); thus, as the Darśapūrṇamāsa, the perfor-
mance of which has the power of producing heaven, i. e.
the {#PalApUrva,#} consists of the two distinct sacrifices Darśa
and Pūrṇamāsa which are performed at distinct times, it
requires an unseen power to effectuate their combining so
as to constitute the sacrifice Darśapūrnamāsa, (for other-
wise neither of both would have a relation to the other or
to that sacrifice itself); this unseen power is the {#samudAyA-#}
{#pUrva;#} likewise the {#utpattyapUrva#} causes the six Yāgas ({#Agneya-#}
{#puroqASayAgaH, EndrapayoyAgaH, EndradaDiyAgaH#} which con-
stitute the Darśa, and the {#AgneyapuroqASayAgaH, Ajyeno-#}
{#pAMSuyAjayAgaH, agnIzomIyapuroqASayAgaH#} which constitute
the Pūrṇamāsa, and are performed, too, at different
times,) to combine so as to become severally the Darśa
and the Pūrṇamāsa; and lastly, as each of these six
Yāgas comprises again a number of inferior acts, such
as the beating of the {%vrīhi,%} the grinding of the {%taṇḍula,%}
[Page199-a+ 56]
the cleansing of the ladles &c., which also are done at
different times, it requires an {#aNgApUrva#} (or {#kalApUrva#}) to
produce the result of their constituting severally each of
these Yāgas.--Such an unseen power might be predi-
cated, indeed, of any act, whether sacrificial or not,
but the term {#apUrva#} is expressly reserved by the Mīmān-
sists to the former ({%Kumārila:%} {#lOkikaM cApi yatkarma Pale#}
{#kAlAntarodgatO . tatrApi SaktirevAste na tvapUrvagirocyate#}), for
the corresponding power of a non-sacrificial or profane act is
called {#saMskAra#}. ({%Kumārila:%} {#yAnyapi ca lOkikAni kfziGf-#}
{#tapAnAdDyayanapraBftIni karmARi kAlAntaraPalatvenezyante tezAmapi#}
{#svarUpAvasTAnAsaMBavAtsaMskArEreva tizWadBirvyavahArasidDaH . te#}

also e. g. {%Mādhava%} in the Pūrvapakṣa of an Adhikaraṇa:
{#yo'yaM svizwakfdyAgaH so'yamupayuktahaviHsaMskAra ityavivAdam .#}
{#tatra saMskArasya dfzwaprayojanatvenAvaSayaMBAve sati tAvatEvopakzI-#}
{#RaH svizwakfdyAgo nApUrvasyopakaroti#} &c.) A doubt may arise,
whether the beating of rice and such like acts have an
{#apUrva,#} if considered absolutely or by themselves, since their
result is the unhusking of the rice and since they are per-
formed for sacrificial purposes, but the Mīmānsists decide
the question in the negative, as it is the characteristic
property of the {#apUrva#} to be an {%unseen%} power, and the un-
husking of rice is a {%visible%} result ({%Mādhava:%} {#dfzwaPale saMBa-#}
{#vatyapUrvaM na kalpanIyam#}); again whether the cleaning of the
sacrificial ladles with kuśa grass and such like acts have an
{#apUrva,#} for their result might be said not to be visible; but the
solution is the same although from a different reason; viz. be-
cause they are undertaken for the sake of the {#dravya,#} i. e. these
inferior acts have an {#apUrva#} only in so far as it concerns
their relation to the superior acts, but not in so far as the
mere material result (of unhusking, the purity of the ves-
sels &c.) is concerned; ({%Jaimini:%} {#tAni#} [scil. {#karmARi#}] {#dvEDaM#}
{#guRapraDAnaBUtAni . yErdravyaM na cikIrzyate tAni praDAnaBUtAni#}
{#dravyasya guRaBUtatvAt#}--such as the Prayājas, when the con-
sideration of the {#dravya#} is subordinate to the superior object
of the sacrifice--{#. yEstu dravyaM cikIrzyate guRastatra pratIyeta dra-#}
{#vyapraDAnatvAt#}--as would be the case with the acts named
before or with the paring of a sacrificial post, when the
act is merely done for the sake of preparing a post &c.).
As the {#apUrva#} produces {%the%} result (swarga), it follows more-
over, that it is not the divinity of the sacrifice who pro-
duces the result or influences the peculiar nature of the
sacrifice, the latter being the consequence of the {#apUrva#} it-
self, ({%Mādhava:%} {#kiM devatAyAH PalapradatvalakzaRaM prADAnyaM Sa-#}
{#bdAdApAdyate . vastusAmarTyAdvA . nAdyaH#} &c. {#….. nApi vastu-#}

{#DarmARAM prayojakam . taTA satyagnyAdidevABAve'pyapUrvaprayukta-#}
{#DarmARAmatideSAdasti tatrohasyAvakASaH#}); and that the sacri-
fice itself is not the chief object, since it, too, has not the
(immediate) power of producing the result ({%Mādhava:%} {#a-#}
{#pUrvaM muKyam . PalavattvAt . yajirna muKyaH . PalarahitatvAt#}).--
A discussion (interesting on account of the questions of
philosophy of grammar implied by it) is raised by the Mī-
mānsā writers, viz. whether many words or a single word
of a sentence and, again, in the latter case which word
[Page199-b+ 56]
and which part of such a word will convey the notion of
the {#apUrva#}. The question is decided in this way: in vaidik
passages, enjoining an act which possesses the unseen
power, such as {#somena yajeta,#} or {#hiraRyamAtreyAya dadAti,#}
or {#tasmAtsuvarRaM hiraRyaM BAryam,#} or {#SyenenABicaranyajeta,#} or
{#citrayA yajeta paSukAmaH,#} not all the words of the sentence
collectively convey the {#apUrva,#} nor a single word expressing
the substance ({#dravya#}) of the sacrificial act, as {#soma#} and {#hi-#}
{#raRya,#} nor the word expressing a quality ({#guRa#}), as {#suvarRa,#}
nor the word expressing the name ({#karmavAci#}) of the sacri-
fice, as {#Syena#} and {#citrA,#} but the {%inflected verb%} or the word
representing it, as {#yajeta, dadAti, BAryam#}. Again, in the
verb the {#apUrva#} is not conveyed by the meaning of the radical
but by that part of it which implies the {%verbal notion%} ({#BA-#}
{#vanA#}), lastly, so far as the {%implicit%} understanding of the
verbal notion ({#arTaBAvanA#} or {#arTAtmaBAvanA#}) is concerned,
any inflection-affix added to the radical might convey it,
provided the connex of the sentence leaves no doubt, as
when the word {#-kAma#} (e. g. {#svargakAmaH#}) is added; but an
{%explicit%} understanding of it ({#SabdaBAvanA#} or {#aBiDABAvanA#})
is only imparted by the inflection-affixes of the {%potential,%}
{%leṭ, the imperative%} and by the affixes of the {%participles of the%}
{%passive future.%} ({%Mādhava:%} {#liNleqlowtavyapratyayamAtragatA Sa-#}

reason {#apUrva#} is authoritative) {#. tato DAtvarTAtiriktaM kAlAnta-#}
{#raBAvi#} &c., see above, p. 198{%b,%} 1. 25).--As the unseen power
is the consequence of the performance of a sacrificial act which
‘has not existed before’ i. e. which is absolute ({%Mādhava:%} {#kaTaM#}
{#vinaSvareRa PalaM kartavyamityapekzAyAmapUrvaM kftvetyucyate . kaTamapUrvaM#}
{#kriyata ityapekzAyAM yAgAnuzWAnaprakAreReti#}) the term {#apUrva#}
assumes also the meaning of such a sacrificial act, and as
the latter requires always an authoritative injunction or
{#viDi,#} since it would not take place otherwise, {#apUrva#} occurs
also in the sense of such an authoritative injunction, viz.
<sup>b.</sup> a {%sacrificial act,%} especially a principal act, one not sub-
ordinate to another act and therefore possessing the un-
seen power of producing {%the%} result (i. e. heaven); e. g. in

which occurs in the present edition of Pāṇini, and there-
fore in the reprint of that edition, is neither mentioned in

compared with such formations as {#AharakarawA, prohakarawA#}
(the latter being the reading of the {%Kāśikā%} instead of {#pre-#}
{#hikawA#}); the word {#apehivAta,#} although of an analogous
formation, belongs to a different category, the ellipsis being
probably {#ozaDi#} or {#latA,#} and does not occur in any of the
lists referring to the mentioned Gaṇa.--From the quoted
comment it results that all these compounds have to be
analyzed literally as meaning a {#kriyA#} or proceeding in which
an injunction is uttered or implied, the component parts
[Page204-a+ 56]
being originally a sentence, e. g. {#apehi vARija#} ‘be off
tradesman’, {#apehi prakasam#} ‘go far away’ &c. and hence
{#apehivARijA#} &c. festivals where such people are kept off

older authorities of the {%Kalpasūtras%} and of {%Kumārila'%}s

sired object’; according to the comm. of {%Śatap.%} XIII. 7.

Dravida Brahmaṇa, the son of {%Nārāyaṇadīkṣita;%} he lived

hana; his contemporaries considered him as an emanation
of Śiva on account of his devotion for this god and his
great learning, for ‘at the age of twelve years he perfectly
studied the Vedas and was besides master of several ab-
struse sciences’. In his crusade for establishing the supe-
riority of Śivaism he was once waylayed in a forest by
ruffians, hired by one of his unvictorious opponents at the
court of Vankatapati, but rescued by timely aid. He
died at Chillumbrum, as it appears, at the age of ninety.

toric and philosophy. {%Colebrooke%} names (essays I. 333. 337)

One of the two sophisms on the irrelevancy of the notion
‘cause’; viz. arguing that if a cause is stated the charac-
teristics of which cannot be proved--as by saying that
the Śyena sacrifice inflicts pain on enemies--, such charac-
teristics prevent a cause from proving the effect, i. e. from
being a valid cause; ({#‘yadi cAprAptaM liNgaM sADyabudDiM janayati#}
{#sADyABAvabudDimeva kiM tena na janayet’#}); the refutation is:
that such a cause is nevertheless valid, since it is an ideal

or wives of the Gandharvas, and daughters of Kaśyapa by
Muni (but the Mss. in question give only twenty-nine, or
if Devī and Manoramā are proper names, thirty-one names):
Antachārā, Daśavadyā(?), Priyaśiṣyā, Surottamā, Miśra-
keśī, Śāchī, Piṇḍinī ({%v. l.%} Parṇinī), Alambuṣā, Mārīchi,
Śuchikā, Vidyudvarṇā, Tilottamā, Adrikā, Lakṣaṇā(?),
Devī, Rambhā, Manoramā (or: the divine, beautiful Rambhā),
Sucharā, Subāhū, Sūrṇitā (?, Sūnṛtā ?), Supratiṣṭhitā, Pu-
ṇḍarīkā, Akṣagandhā ({%v. l.%} Sugandhā), Sudantā, Surasā, He-
mā, Śāradvatī, Suvrittā, Kamalāchayā, Subhujā, Hansapādā;
these are called the {%laukikī%} or {%worldly%} Apsarasas; then six
daughters of Gandharvas: Suyaśā, Gāndharvī, Vidyāvatī,
Aśvavatī, Sumukhī, Varānanā; and four daughters of Suyaśā,
also called Apsaras: Lauheyī, Bharatā, Kṛśāṅgī ({%v. l.%} Kṛ-
[Page223-a+ 56]
ṣṇāṅgī) and Viśālā; then eight daughters of Kaśyapa by
Ariṣṭā: Anavadyā, Anavaśā, Atyantamadanapriyā, Surūpā,
Subhagā, Bhāsī, Manovatī and Sukeśī; then the {%daivati%} or
{%divine%} Apsarasas: Vedakā (sic, but {%v. l.%} Menakā), Sahajanyā,
Parṇinī, Puñjikasthalā, Kratusthalā, Ghṛtāchī, Viśvāchī,
Pūrvachitti, Pramlochā, Anumlochantī, to whom are added
Urvaśī, born from the thigh of Nārāyaṇa, and Menakā
the daughter of Brahman. Besides these the {%Vāyu-P.%} men-
tions fourteen Gaṇas or classes of Apsarasas: 1. The Śobha-
yantyas, produced by the mind (manas) of Brahman, 2. the
Vegavatyas born in heaven (? the Mss. {#svarizwAH#}), 3. the
Ūryās (?, perhaps Ūrjas, comp. {%Vājas.%} 18. 41.), produced by
Agni (comp. {%Vājas.%} 18. 38.), 4. the Āyuvatyas, by the Sun
(comp. {%Vājas.%} 18. 39.), 5. the Śubhañcharās, by Wind (comp.
{%Vājas.%} 18. 41.), 6. the Kuravas(?), by the Moon (Mss.: {#…#}
{#somasya jYeyAste kuravaH SuBAH;#} perhaps their name is Bheku-
rayas, as occurring also in another passage of one Ms.;
comp. {%Vājas.%} 18. 40.), 7. the Śubhās (?), by Sacrifice (; their
name is perhaps Stāvās, comp. {%Vājas.%} 18. 42.), 8. the Vahna-
yas (? perhaps Eṣṭayas, comp. {%Vājas.%} 18. 43.), by the Rich-
and Sāman-verses, 9. the Amṛtās, by Amṛta, 10. the Mu-
das by Water; (three Mss. have {#vAyutpannAH#} and one Ms.
{#vAyUtpannAH#} which however must be corrected {#vAryutpannAH,#}
since {#vAyujAH#} occurs under 5; comp. {%Vājas.%} 18. 38), 11. the
Bhavās(?), by the Earth, 12. the Ruchas, by Lightning,
13. the Bhairavās, by Death (comp. {%Vājas.%} 24. 37.) and 14.
the Śoṣayantyas, by Love; (this list is probably meant
by the author of the Kādambarī, who--ed. Calc. p. 122--
professes to give fourteen classes of Apsarasas, but, in fact,
only names thirteen, fathering moreover one class on Da-
ksha).--The {%Harivanśa%} (v. 6798) speaks of seven Gaṇas
of Apsarasas, but, without naming them. {%Vyādi,%} ad quoted
in a comm. on Hemachandra, mentions an Apsaras Prabhāvatī
as born from a hole in the ground for receiving the fire con-
secrated to Brahman, Vedavatī as born from an altar-ground,
Sulochanā from Yama, Urvaśī from the left thigh of Viṣṇu,
Rambhā from the mouth of Brahman, Chitralekhā from
his hand, and from his head Mahāchittā, Kākalikā, Mā-
rīchī, Sūchikā, Vidyutparṇā, Tilottamā, Adrikā, Lakṣaṇā,
Kṣemā, the divine and beautiful Rāmā (or Divyā, Rāmā,
Manoramā), Hemā, Sugandhā, Suvasu, Subāhū, Suvratā,
Asitā, Śāradvatī, Puṇḍarīkā, Surasā, Sūnṛtā, Suvātā,
Kāmalā, Hansapadī, Sumukhī, Menakā, Sahajanyā, Parṇinī,
Puñjikasthalā, Ṛtusthalā, Ghṛtāchī and Viśvāchī.
<div n="P"><sup>c.</sup> Originally these divinities seem to have been personi-
fications of the vapours which are attracted by the Sun
and form into mist or clouds; their character may be thus
interpreted in the few hymns of the Ṛgveda where mention
is made of them. At a subsequent period when the Gan-
dharva of the Ṛgveda who personifies there especially the
Fire of the Sun, expanded into the Fire of Lightning, the
rays of the Moon and other attributes of the elementary
life of heaven as well as into pious acts referring to it, the
Apsarasas become divinities which represent phenomena or
objects both of a physical and ethical kind closely associated
with that life; thus in the {%Yajurveda%} Sunbeams are called
[Page223-b+ 56]
the Apsarasas associated with the Gandharva who is the Sun;
Plants are termed the Apsarasas associated with the Gan-
dharva Fire: Constellations are the Apsarasas of the Gan-
dharva Moon: Waters the A. of the G. Wind: Sacrificial gifts
the A. of the G. Sacrifice: Rich- and Sāman hymns the A.
of the G. Manas (creating will); in another passage of the
{%Vājas.%} Fire is connected ({%Mahīdhara:%} in the two months
of Vasanta or spring) with the two Apsarasas Puñjikasthalā
and Kratusthalā (considered by the comm. as personifi-
cations of a principal and an intermediate point of the com-
pass), Wind (Viswakarman) with Menakā and Sahajanyā
({%comm.:%} in the two months of Grīṣma or the hot season),
Sun (Viśvavyachas) with Pramlochantī and Anumlochantī
({%comm.:%} in the two months of Varṣā or the rainy season),
Sacrifice (Samyadvasu) with Viśvāchī and Ghṛtāchī ({%comm.:%}
in the two months of Śarad or the sultry season), Parjanya
(Arvāgvasu) with Urvaśī and Pūrvachitti ({%comm.:%} in the
two months of Hemanta or the cold season).--This latter
idea becomes then more systematized in the {%Purāṇas,%} when
a description is given of the Genii that attend the chariot
of the Sun in its yearly course; thus the {%Bhāgavata P.%}
mentions that besides the Ṛṣis, Gandharvas &c. also one
Gaṇa or troupe of Apsarasas pays adoration to the Sun every
month; and the {%Viṣṇu P.,%} that among the Genii who pre-
side each in every month over the chariot of the Sun, Kra-
tusthalā performs this function in the month Madhu, Punji-
kasthalā in the month Mādhava, Menā in Śuchi, Sahajanyā
in Śukra, Pramlochā in Nabhas, Anumlochā in Bhādra-
pada, Ghṛtachī in Āsvina, Visvāchī in Kārttika, Urvaśī
in Agrahāyaṇa, Pūrvachitti in Pausha, Tilottamā in Māgha,
Rambhā in Phālguna; an analogous description is given in
the {%Vāyu P.%} with the only difference that Viprachitti takes
the place of Pūrvachitti, apparently with less correctness,
as this account is a strict developement of the quoted pas-
sage of the Yajurveda ({%Vājas.%} 15. 15-19.). In the last my-
thological epoch when the Gandharvas have saved from
their elementary nature merely so much as to be the musi-
cians in the paradise of Indra, the Apsarasas appear amongst
other subordinate deities which share in the merry life of
Indra's heaven, as the wives of the Gandharvas, but more
especially as wives of a licentious sort, and they are pro-
mised therefore, too, as a reward to heroes fallen in battle
when they are received in the paradise of Indra; and while,
in the Ṛgveda, they assist Soma to pour down his floods,
they descend in the epic literature on earth merely to shake
the virtue of penitent Sages and to deprive them of the
power they would have otherwise acquired through un-
broken austerities.--To this association of the ethical with
the physical element in the character of the Apsarasas
belongs also that view expressed by {%Manu,%} according to
which the Soul in its transmigrations is reborn as Apsaras
when it was in its previous existence under the influence of
rajas or passion; and probably too the circumstance, that in
the {%Atharvaveda%} they are fond of dice, and three Apsarasas,
whose names are given above, are supposed to have the
power of removing faults committed at gambling with dice.

by whom beauty is taken ({#tad#}--scil. {#rUpam--anayAttam#})’
or ‘one to whom beauty is given ({#tadasyE dattam#})’; a similar

{%Patanj.%} on {%Pāṇ.%} V. 2. 95: {#urvaSI vE rUpiRyapsarasAm#}), but
this kind of popular E. of the word is as little plausible as
that given by the {%Rāmāyaṇa,%} according to which these deities
would derive their name from the circumstance that they
arose from the essence ({#rasa#}) which was obtained from the
churning ‘in the waters’ ({#apsu#}) of the ocean.

{#aBi#}¦ ind. (see {#nipAta, upasarga, gati, karmapravacanIya#}) A particle
implying the notion of proximity, hence of conjunction,
relation, superiority, excess, in their literal and metapho-
rical acceptations (and thus becoming in many instances
synonymous as well with {#A, anu#} as with {#aDi, api,#}
{#ati#}); it is used either as a prefix to verbs, and as such,
in the Vedas and archaic passages of the classical literature,
also detached from the verb (very much in the same man-
ner as German prepositions when connected with verbs):
or as a separable preposition: or, in the Vedas and archaic
passages of the classical literature, as an adverb. With
nouns it may form Tatpur., Bahuvr. and Avyayībh. com-
pounds. It appears, too, in the protracted form {#aBI;#} e. g.
(ved.) {#aBI zu RaH,#} and comp. {#aBIka, aBIGAta, aBIzaNga#} &c.
<div n="P">1. ({%as a prefix to verbs%} it means) <sup>1</sup> Towards, to (im-
plying proximity); e. g. {#gam#} or {#i#} or {#yA,#} with {#aBi,#} ‘to
go towards, to approach’; {#kram#} or {#DAv,#} with {#aBi,#} ‘to
attack’; {#vah#} with {#aBi,#} ‘to carry towards’; {#vad#} with {#aBi,#}
‘to salute’; in many instances where the radical itself im-
plies this notion, it increases merely the power of the verbal
meaning and becomes often untranslateable in English; e. g.
{#pIq#} ‘to squeeze, to vex’ has the same meaning, but in an
increased degree, with {#aBi, grah#} with {#aBi#} means, like
{#grah,#} ‘to receive’; {#Barts#} ‘to reproach, to threaten’ has the
same sense with {#aBi; han#} with {#aBi#} means the same as
{#han#} &c. <sup>2</sup> Towards, for, against (implying relation, when
the same remark applies as before); e. g. {#laz#} with {#aBi,#}
‘to desire, to wish for’, {#rAD#} with {#aBi,#} ‘to be favourable
towards’, {#druh#} with {#aBi,#} ‘to have animosity against’;
{#yuj#} with {#aBi#} (esp. pass.), ‘to bring an action against,
to accuse’. <sup>3</sup> On, upon (implying contiguity and answer-
ing frequently the cognate English be-); e. g. {#su#} with {#aBi,#}
‘to pour the juice of the Soma upon’, {#sic#} with {#aBi,#}
‘to sprinkle upon, to be-sprinkle, {#jan#} with {#aBi,#} ‘to be
be-got’. <sup>4</sup> On, above, over (implying superiority or master-
ship); e. g. {#BU#} or {#as#} (cl. 2.) with {#aBi,#} ‘to overpower’;
{#as#} (cl. 1. or cl. 4.) with {#aBi,#} ‘to study’ (comp. {#gam, i#}
&c. with {#aDi#}).
<div n="P">2. ({%as a separable preposition%}) with a noun following
or preceding in the accusative; <sup>1</sup> Towards, to, in the di-
rection of; e. g. {%Vājas.:%} {#suprajAH prajAH prajanayanparIhyaBi rA-#}
{#yaspozeRa yajamAnam;#} or {%Manu:%} {#taM cedaByudiyAtsUryaH#} &c.; (comp.

{#zvaNvyakrAmatsASanAnaSane aBi;#} or {%Siddh. K.:%} {#Bakto harimaBi#}.

e. g. {%Ṛgv.:%} {#saDrIcInena manasA tamindra ojizWena hanmanAhannaBi#}
{#dyUn#} ‘…on certain days’; or {#yatte gAtrAdagninA pacyamAnA-#}
{#daBi SUlaM#} (on the spit) {#nihatasyAvaDAvati#} &c. <sup>5</sup> Over (im-
plying dominion, mastership); e. g. {%Ṛgv.:%} {#sa tu SruDi SrutyA#}
{#yo duvoyurdyOrna BUmABi rAyo aryaH#}. <sup>6</sup> By (implying distri-
bution), severally; e. g. {%comm. on Pāṇ.:%} {#vfkzaM vfkzamaBi siYcati#}
or {#devaM devamaBi siYcati#}.
[Page237-a+ 56]

ellipsis {#dadAti (aByABimuKyena dadAtIti SezaH)#}. <sup>2</sup> All round,

it retains the meaning which it has as prefix to the radical;
e. g. in {#aBikrama, aBiGAta, aBizeka#} &c.; <sup>2</sup> if it is not {#u-#}

stition ({#lOkika,#} such as taking the dust of the feet, digging

apparently a better reading than {#mUlaniKanana#} in the present edd.
of {%Kull.%}--&c.) for the purpose of {%causing death;%} {#mUlakarman#} is,

for the sake of {%causing ruin, making sick%} &c., according to
{%Medh.,%} for the sake of {%causing ruin, animosity between friends%}
{%or relatives, working wonders%} &c. ({#uccAwanasuhfdbanDukalahavici-#}
{#trIkaraRAdihetavaH#}).--{%Manu%} fines a person who employs
charms two hundred Paṇas (9. 290.), classes in another pas-
sage {#aBicAra#} and {#mUlakarman#} amongst the Upapātaka (11. 63.)
and makes the expiation of an {#aBicAra#} depend on the per-
formance, thrice repeated, of the penance called Kṛchchhra
(11. 197.). But as these clauses would jar apparently with
the vaidik texts which impliedly sanction the employment
of charms by regulating the sacrifices Śyena &c. performed
for incantatory purposes, {%Kullūka%} qualifies the definition of
Manu 11. 63. by commenting that {#aBicAra#} is an {#upapAtaka,#} if
it causes the death of an {%innocent%} or {%unoffending%} person ({#SyenA-#}
{#diyajYenAnaparADasya mAraRam#}), while {%Medhātithi%} seems merely
[Page240-b+ 56]
to lay stress on the fact of {%death%} itself (although the death
be that of an enemy) and perhaps too on the condition of
death being caused by a {%vaidik%} kind of incantation ({%Medh.%}
to 11. 63.: {#aBicAro vEdikena SApAdinA mantraprayogeRa Sye-#}
{#nAdiyAgena vA SatrumAraRam,#} or to 11. 197.: {#vEdikena japaho-#}
{#mAdinA SatrormAraRamaBicAraH#}); for the same reason, pro-
bably, both comm. agree in giving to the penalty clause
(9. 290) the additional sense: ‘if the incantation does {%not%}
{%cause death%}’, and qualify, in the clause 11. 197., the incan-
tation as one ‘directed against a person who ought not to have
been brought under the spell (i. e. an innocent or unoffending
person)’; some however, as results from {%Medh.'%}s discussion
on the latter verse, give it a different bearing, for they supply
the preceding word {#yAjana#} at {#aBicAra#} and subject thus to the
penance Kṛchchhra, not the {#yajamAna#} or the person who
institutes an incantatory sacrifice, but the {#ftvij#} or the
priest who performs for him such a sacrifice. But in spite
of these efforts of the commentators to establish a harmony
between Manu and the Veda, it will seem that another
possibility alluded to by {%Medhātithi%} is more plausible, viz.
that Manu did not attach any scriptural authority to such
voluntary rites, as the incantatory sacrifices, and, there-
fore, did not consider himself at variance with the Veda,
when he interdicted incantations in an unqualified manner;

doctrine.) Supernatural knowledge, a supernatural faculty
attached to the Arhatship; there are five, or according to
some six, such faculties viz. 1. the faculty of divine sight,
i. e. the faculty of seeing, without obstacle, all beings and
bodies, of whatever kind, in the totality of the worlds;
2. that of divine hearing, i. e. the faculty of understanding
all words of joy or grief uttered by the beings, and all
sounds of whatever kind uttered in all the worlds (or ‘the
power to hear all sounds whether distant or near, whether
made by devas or men’: {%Spence Hardy'%}s {%Eastern Monachism%});
3. that of knowing the thoughts of other beings; 4. that
of knowing former existences or what births have been
got in former ages; 5. magic power or the power to
assume any shape, to pass without obstacle over seas and
mountains, and to disappear from one world for the sake
of reappearing in another; to these some add: 6. {%āśra-%}
{%vakshaya,%} (which according to {%Burnouf%} probably means)
the power of destroying defects or vices. (See {%Burnouf'%}s
{%Lotus de la bonne loi%} p. 820 seqq.; there is a difference be-
tween this enumeration and that of {%Hardy%} in his {%Eastern%}
{%Monachism%} (p. 284): he has but five {%abhijnās,%} identifies the
magic power and the {%āśravakṣaya%} without defining how-
ever either term, omits the first (the faculty of divine
sight) and has an {%abhijnā%} not named by {%Burnouf:%} the
power of knowing what births will be received in fu-
ture ages). Compare {#zaqaBijYa#}. E. {#jYA#} with {#aBi,#} kṛt

to be implied by the prefix {#aBi#}], viz. <sup>a.</sup> the suppression
of the vowel {#a#} through the influence of a {%preceding%} {#o#} or

pression or weakening of the sound or of the vibration of
the voice which naturally follows the pronunciation of a
consonant, if such a consonant is {%followed%} by, and has made
{%sandhi%} with, another consonant; according to the {%Ṛgv.%}

if the consonant is sonant ({#ga, ja#} &c.) and the sound which
{%remains,%} after such weakening is called {#Druva#} (q. v.). This
suppression or weakening of the vibration of the voice,
however, takes place only under the following restrictions:
1. in the pronunciation of a {#sparSa#} or {#antaHsTA#} (except {#r#}),
[Page248-a+ 56]
if it is followed by a {#sparSa;#} e. g. in {#arvAgdevaH#} or in {#ulkAm;#}
2. of a {#sparSa,#} if it stands in a pause; e. g. in {#vAk;#} 3. of an
{#antaHsTA,#} if it is followed by another similar {#antaHsTA;#}
e. g. in {#tavvaM~H;#} 4 of {#l,#} if it is followed by an {#Uzman;#} e. g.
in {#SatavalSaH;#} 5. of {#k#} in {#akKyat;#} 6. of {#p#} in {#virapsI;#} 7. of

{#r, v#} or an {#Uzman;#} e. g. in {#yadyat, tadrAsaBaH, yAnvaH, arvA-#}
{#kSaPO;#} (the latter cases 4-7. only in the theory of the {%Śā-%}
{%kalas%}). These general rules are subject to exceptions and
restrictions, and even as such they are not universally re-
cognized; {%Śaunaka,%} for instance, says, that {%Vyāĺi%} does not
recognize the {#aBiniDAna,#} {%in general,%} and admits of it only
when the following consonant is doubled or if a vowel or
{#r#} precede.--The {%Vājas. Prātiś.%} uses instead of the term
{#aBiniDAna#} the explanation {#sTAnakaraRavimokzaH#} ‘giving up
the characteristics of a consonant, viz. the organic dis-
tinction and the distinction with regard to the effort of pro-
nunciation’; (comp. the list in {%Pāṇ.%} I. 1. 9. where {#karaRa#}
answers the {#prayatna;#} and see {%Weber'%}s ed. of this {%Prātiś. Ind.%}
{%Stud.%} IV. p. 127), but applies it merely to the {#sparSa#} at the
end of a word, if it is followed by another word, and in
a pause.--The {%Atharvav. Prātiś.%} (quoted by {%Weber 1. c.,%}
where the {%masc.%} {#aBiniDAnaH#} seems to be an error of the
Berlin Ms.) admits the {#aBiniDAna#} only 1. of a {#sparSa,#} if it
is followed by a {#sparSa,#} 2. of a {#sparSa#} at the end of a word or
at an {#avagraha,#} 3. of {#l#} before an {#Uzman,#} 4 of {#N, Ra, na,#}
before {#h#}. {%Śākalya,%} in the cases 4-7. mentioned above, and
the {%Atharvav. Prātiś.%} in its enumeration do not consider
two consonants, the first of which suffers the {%abhinidhāna,%}
as {#saMyukta#} or combined consonants ({%Śaunaka:%} {#asaMyuktaM SA-#}
{#kalam;#} {%Atharvav. Pr.:%} {#ato'nyatsaMyuktam ‘saMyukta#} is a com-
bination of consonants other than that in the preceding
cases’); i. e. they assume such a stoppage of the voice as
to prevent two consonants to sound together; but {%Śaunaka%}
does not seem to go so far, for he quotes {%Śākalya%} apparently
for the sake of recording his dissent from the opinion of
the latter. The distinction is probably owing to the dif-
ference in the observation, by the different grammarians,
of the phenomena of pronunciation; the supposition of {%Mr.%}
{%Regnier%} ({%Journ. Asiat.%} 1857, p. 230), that there is a twofold
{%abhinidhāna,%} the one applying to the consonantic groups
which are the {%natural%} effect of the sandhi, the other to such
groups as are produced by the {%krama,%} is very ingenious,
but does not necessarily follow from the text of this {%Prātiś.%}
(I. 1. 6. and 7.); for similar differences of opinion in the theory
on the pronunciation of consonantic groups, arising ob-
viously from different observations, may be gathered also
from the Sūtras of Pāṇini. [In the preceding explanation
the term {#sparSa#} comprises the 25 consonants {#ka-Na, ca-Ya,#}
{#wa-Ra, ta-na#} and {#pa-ma;#} the term {#Uzman#} (q. v.) the sibi-
lants {#ha, Sa, za, sa;#} and the semivowels {#ya, ra, la, va#} are
termed {#antaHsTA,#} because their position in the system of
the vaidik gramm. is between the {#sparSa#} and {#Uzman;#} (s. v.
{#antaHsTA#} p. 117{%a,%} 1. 49 the words ‘vowels and consonants’
are a mistake for ‘{#sparSa#} and {#Uzman#}’).] E. {#DA#} with {#ni#} and

by {%Āśvalāyana%} and {%Baudhāyana%} with the addition that he
should first touch, with composure of mind, his own left
ear with his left and his right ear with his right, hand,
and then make his bow, in the indicated manner, by
touching his Guru from the knees to the feet; ({%Āśvalāy.:%}

when saluting should raise his right arm as far as his ears,
a Kshatriya as far as his breast (or according to a v. 1. as
far as his shoulder), a Vaiśya as far as his navel and that
a Sūdra making his obeisance should hold it down ({%Āpast.:%}

politeness of touching her from the knees to the feet is sub-
ject to some restrictions: if she is the wife of the {%Guru,%}
but not of the same class as her husband, {%Manu%} and other
legislators dispense with it altogether; if she is of the same
class and the student is young, he must pay her that re-
spect only when he returns from a journey, on other oc-
casions he prostrates himself before her at his daily salu-
tation, ({%Vīram.%} on {%Manu%} 2. 217. and {%Gautama:%} {#viprozyeti va-#}
{#canAnna pratyahamiti gamyate#}); but if she is young and the young
man knows already to distinguish right from wrong which
[Page265-a+ 56]
is the case when he has completed his twentieth year (ac-
cording to {%Manu;%} or his sixteenth year, according to the
{%Vīram.%} on {%Gautama%}) he must never touch her feet but al-
ways prostrate himself before her; {%Manu%} enjoins further
that the sister of his mother, the wife of his maternal
uncle, his own wife's mother and the sister of his father
must be treated by him like the wife of his Guru, equally
so the wife of his brother ({%comm.:%} the eldest wife, of the
same class), and that the sister of his father and of his
mother as well as his own elder sister must be saluted in
the same manner as his mother, but that his paternal and
maternal kinswomen are to be greeted by touching their
feet only on his return from a journey. {%Gautama'%}s rule
that the wives of a brother and one's own wife's mother
are never to be touched in this manner is restricted by the
{%Vīramitrodaya%} to the wives of the same class ({%Gaut.:%} {#nopa-#}
{#saMgrahaRaM BrAtfBAryARAM SvaSrvASca;#} {%Viram.:%} {#yannopa°° iti gOta-#}
{#mavAkyaM tadasavarRAvizayam#}), and when the same legislator
enjoins that with the exception of a mother, the wife of a
paternal uncle and a sister, no woman must be touched
by her feet in being greeted except on the return from a
journey, the same commentator infers that this ceremony
is obligatory on the latter occasion ({%Gautama:%} {#nAviprozya#}

<div n="P"><sup>c.</sup> The formula of salutation consists in general, if the
person greeted is a man, of the word {#aBivAdaye#} ‘I greet’,
followed by the declaration of the saluter's own name and
ending with the reverential word {#BoH#} ({%Manu:%} {#aBivAdAtparaM#}

or {#aBivAdaya indrapAlito'haM BoH,#} or (if a woman greets) e. g.
{#aBivAdaye gArgyahaM BoH;#} according to the {%Vīram.,%} some com-
bine with the declaration of the name also that of the family
and the descendants when the word {#aBivAdaye#} is placed
at the end of the salutation, e. g. {#amukapravaro'mukagotro'muka-#}
{#SarmAhaM Bo BivAdaye#} ‘father of such and such a son, descendant
of such and such a family, I, such and such a…sarman,
(e. g. {#kfzRaSarman#}) Sir, greet (thee)’; if husband and wife salute
there is no other restriction ({%Gaut.:%} {#strIpuMyoge'BivAdato#}
{#'niyamameke#}), but the formula becomes shortened in this way:
{#aBivAdaye gArgyahaM gArgaSarmAhaM BoH#}. If the person saluted is a
woman or a Śūdra or a man who either does not understand
the Sanskṛt meaning of the proper name or does not know
the proper manner of protracting the final vowel of the
name in the return of the salutation or is otherwise igno-
rant of the proper manner of returning it (see g.), the formula
of the saluter is simply thus: {#‘aBivAdaye'ham’#} ‘I greet’,

the formula; e. g. {%Medhāt.:%} {#aBivAdaye devadattanAmAhaM BoH,#}

authorities; e. g. {%Kullūka%} in reference to this use of {#nAman:#}

<div n="P"><sup>d.</sup> The general rule that prevails at a salutation is that
the person who receives it must be an ‘elder’ or what is
technically termed a {%Guru%} and that the person who pays
it must be a ‘youth’ or an inferior; such a salutation
may be of course occasional, but it is a duty of a youth
to salute his ‘elders’ or ‘Gurus’ every morning after
he has managed the consecrated fire ({%Yājnav.:%} {#agnikAryaM#}

{#ti bruvan;#} {%Yama:%} {#tato'BivAdayedvfdDAnagnikAryAdanantaram;#}
{%Gautama:%} {#guroH pAdopasaMgrahaRaM prAtaH#}).--For the persons
comprised under the name {#guru#} and their relative superiority
or inferiority see s. v., it may suffice here to give the de-
finition of {%Devala%} who enumerates as male Gurus: the
teacher (see {#upADyAya#}), the father, the eldest brother, the
king, the maternal and paternal uncle, the father-in-law,
an initiated householder, the maternal and paternal grand-
father, and the eldest of the same class; as female Gurus:
the mother, the maternal and paternal grandmother, the
sisters of father and mother, the mother-in-law, and the
old nurse; and to add from the definition of others the
priest (see {#ftvij#}) and the spiritual teacher (see {#AcArya#}).
If there are several persons present who have a claim to a
salutation, the teacher who has given instruction either on
worldly or ritual or spiritual matters, has precedence be-
fore all others, according to {%Manu%} ({#lOkikaM vEdikaM cApi#}
{#taTADyAtmikameva ca . AdadIta yato jYAnaM taM pUrvamaBivAdayet#}),
and, in general, every superior Guru has precedence before
the one next to him in degree. [In the passage of {%Gautama:%}

{#dgurURAM ca#} (i. e. their maternal or paternal grandfathers &c.)

each {%superior; Vīram.:%} {#mAtrAdInAM purA yatsaMnipAte samAgame#}
{#parasyotkfzwasya praTamamupasaMgrahaRaM kartavyam#}.] The term ‘youth’
mentioned above is not to be taken in its literal, but in its
metaphorical sense; for {%Manu%} rules that fellow citizens are
equal (as to age) for ten years, dancers and singers for five,
learned theologians for three, but persons related by blood
for a very short time; again, that one must consider a
Brāhmaṇa though but ten years old, as if he were the father
of a Kshatriya though aged a hundred years; therefore a
friend, e. g., is not to be addressed with the words {#BoH#} or
{#Bavat,#} unless he be older than ten years, and a Brāhmaṇa
must never salute first a Kshatriya or a man of a lower
class, however distinguished he be ({%Vīram.:%} {#daSavarzADikakaH#}

<div n="P"><sup>e.</sup> Persons not to be saluted are, according to {%Manu, Gau-%}
{%tama, Baudhāyana:%} a priest ({%Ṛtvij%}), a wife's father, a maternal
and paternal uncle, learned and pious persons, {%if they are%}
{%younger;%} they are merely to be addressed with the words ‘I, so
and so, am here’ {#asAvaham,#} and to be honoured by rising from
the seat; this ceremony does not constitute, therefore, an
{#aBivAdana#}. [In {%Manu%} 2. 130. the word {#gurUn#} is to be taken
in the sense of ‘an elder by learning and piousness’; it
does not occur in the corresponding passages of {%Gautama%}

{#vIyasAM pratyutTAnamanaBivAdyAH;#} the latter with the same words
except for the last, {#pratyutTAyABiBAzaRam#}.] In law courts, in
houses of penance and palaces where Brāhmaṇas are assem-
bled, the latter are not to be saluted individually, but the words
{#sarveByo namaH#} ‘respect to all’ are to be addressed to the whole
assembly; this mode of address is called the {#namaskAra#} which
is different therefore from the {#aBivAdana;#} ({%Viṣṇu:%} {#saBAsu#}

his hands and one who performs the Japahoma; {%Kātyāyana:%}

impious man, a thief and a cheat, a man fond of litigation,
a drunken man, one who vomits or stands in water, one
who carries rice given to him as alms or one who is in a
lying position, one who performs a Śrāddha, a vow or a
sacrifice; amongst {%women Śātātapa%} forbids to greet: one in
her courses, one recently delivered, one who has killed her
husband and one who has miscarried.
<div n="P"><sup>f.</sup> A man must not salute, according to {%Āpastamba,%} while
he has his shoes on, while his head is covered ({#vezwitaSi-#}

{%Śaṅkha,%} while he carries water in his hands, while he is
unclean, performs funeral rites or is in a lying position
…, according to {%Baudhāyana,%} while he carries fuel, a
water-jug, flowers or rice.
<div n="P"><sup>g.</sup> The return of the salutation or the {#pratyaBivAdana#} con-
sists, generally, in uttering first the words {#AyuzmAnBava#}
{#sOmya#} ‘long mayst thou live, friend’ or similar words to
the same effect; ({%Manu:%} {#AyuzmAnBava sOmyeti vAcyo vipro#}
{#'BivAdane,#} where the word {#iti#} indicates, according to {%Me-%}
{%dhātithi%} and the {%Vīramitrodaya,%} that the preceding words are
merely an illustration of the phrase to be used; thus the
address may be worded also in this manner: {#AyuzmAneDi#} or
{#dIrGAyurBUyAH#} or {#ciraM jIva#} &c.); these words are followed
[Page266-b+ 56]
by the name of the person who has greeted first and, if
the latter is a Brāhmaṇa, the last vowel of his name, which
at the same time is the last vowel of the whole phrase, be-
comes protracted (according to the general rules on making
vowels {#pluta#} q. v.); some require moreover, that the name
should always receive the addition of the word {#Sarman,#} others,
however, consider this addition unnecessary ({%Manu:%} {#akA-#}
{#raScAsya nAmno'nte vAcyaH pUrvAkzaraH plutaH;#} {%Vīram.:%} {#tatra nAmE-#}
{#veti kecit . SarmAntamityapare#}); the return of the salute to
a Brāhmaṇa would therefore run on the following pattern:
{#AyuzmAnBava sOmya devadattA3,#} or {#AyuzmAnBava sOmya devada-#}
{#ttaSarmA 3 n,#} or {#AyuzmAnBava piRAkapARA 3 i (= piRAka-#}
{#pARe),#} or {#…vizRA 3 u (= vizRo),#} or {#AyuzmAneDi#}
{#…#} &c.; (the omission of the word {#Sarman#} when it originally
belongs to the name, or the omission of the name altogether
are rebuked by {%Kullūka%}). If the person thus addressed is
a Kshatriya or Vaiśya or if the word {#BoH#} is added after
the name (which seems permitted according to {%Kātyāyana%}
on {%Pāṇ.%} VIII. 2. 83., although {%Patanjali%} observes that other
authorities do not approve of the combination of the name
{%and%} {#BoH,#} but allow only the enunciation of the one or the
other), the protraction of the vowel is optional; e. g. in
returning the salute to a Kshatriya: {#AyuzmAneDIndravarmA 3 n#}
or {#…°varman,#} to a Vaiśya: {#AyuzmAneDIndrapAlitA 3#} or
{#…°pAlita;#} or with {#BoH, AyuzmAneDi devadatta BoH 3#} or
{#…BoH#} (but the latter phrase should be, according to the
above mentioned observation, either {#AyuzmAneDi BoH 3#} or
{#…devadattA 3#}); if the person addressed is a woman or a
Śūdra or spoken to in contempt or derision, no protraction
of the vowel takes place, e. g. a woman: {#AyuzmatI Bava#}
{#gArgi;#} a Śūdra: {#AyuzmAneDi tuzajaka;#} or in contempt: {#A-#}
{#yuzmAneDi sTAlin#} ({%Patanjali:%} {#asUyakastvamasi jAlma . na tvaM#}

{#devadatta kuSalyasi, devadatta AyuzmAneDi#} which are not word-
ed in the proper manner in which the return of a salutation
should be made, since the name does not stand at the end
of the sentence, the protraction of the vowel is equally
prohibited).--If the person to whom the salutation is to
be returned, has performed the preparatory observances of
a sacrifice, his name should not be enounced but in its
place the reverential word {#BoH;#} and to the wife of another
or to any woman not related by blood the epithet of address
should be {#Bavati#} or {#suBage#} or {#Bagini#} (according to {%Manu%}).
After the person has returned the greeting, he may put
the usual polite questions, after the saluter's health &c.;
(it is not therefore the latter who asks after the health &c.
of the person who returns the salute, for {%Govindarāja%} who
expresses that opinion, is rebuked for it by {%Kullūka%}); the
model, however, laid down by {%Manu%} and {%Āpastamba,%} that
a Brāhmaṇa must be asked whether he prospers, a Ksha-
[Page267-a+ 56]
triya whether he is quite well, a Vaiśya whether he is
happy, and a Śūdra whether he is free from disease ({%Manu:%}
{#brAhmaRaM kuSalaM pfcCetkzatrabanDumanAmayam . vESyaM kzemaM samAgamya#}

{#vA vipraM pfcCet . anAmayaM kzatriyaM kzemaM vESyamArogyaM SUdram#})
is not to be taken in its literal sense, as the commentators
observe and as may be inferred from instances in the epic
and dramatic literature; thus in the {%Sabhāparvan%} of the {%Ma-%}
{%hābhārata, Nārada%} after having returned the salute of {%Yu-%}
{%dhishthira%} does not content himself with the question whether
the king is quite well, but overwhelms him with an inter-
rogatory of 110 Slokas (v. 151-260) which is perhaps the
completest of its kind, though probably an overdone illus-
tration of this part of a Hindu greeting.

The word occurs in the {%Mānava Kalpa Sūtras%} where it is
rendered by {%Kumārila%} {#vivatsA,#} and twice in a quotation of

<div n="P">{%A.%} INAUGURATION OF A KING. This ceremony is either
part of a Rājasūya, and performed by a king at the end
of this sacrifice--when it is called {#punaraBizeka#} or {%second%}
{%inauguration,%} since the {%Abhisheka%} or first inauguration of a
king must have taken place previously--; or it is not
part of a sacrifice and occurs at a king's accession to the
throne--then it is the {#aBizeka#} proper. [Both ceremonies
are described in the {%Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,%} first the {%Punar-%}
{%abhisheka,%} then the {%Abhisheka;%} in conformity with this au-
thority the same order has been preserved in the following
account, since the {%Abhisheka%} ceremony refers in many re-
spects to that of the {%Punarabhisheka.%}]
<div n="P">{%a.%} The {%Punarabhisheka%} is performed by a king at the
end of a {%Rājasūya,%} after he has undergone preliminary
purification ({#dIkzA#}), when he has risen from the {%Avabhṛtha%}
ceremonies, has performed the {%Anūbandhya%} sacrifice and
completed the final rite, the {%Udavasanīyā.%} There must have
been prepared for the occasion a throne-seat ({#AsandI#}) of
the wood of the {%Udumbara%} (ficus glomerata), resting on
four legs a span ({#prAdeSa#}) high, with boards placed on
them ({#SIrzaRya;#} see below page 277{%b,%} line 6 ff.) and side boards
({#anUcya;#} see ibid.) of the dimension of a cubit (or two spans;
{#aratni,#} {%Sāyaṇa:%} {#prAdeSadvayamaratniH#}); the whole well fastened
together with a texture made of cords of {%Munja%} grass
(Saccharum munja), a tiger skin which is placed on the
seat with the hairs upwards and the neck to the east, a
large (four cornered) ladle ({#camasaH;#} {%Sāy.%} at a later occa-
sion: = {#catuzkoRo daRqayuktaH pAtraviSezaH#}) of {%Udumbara%} wood
and a branch of the same; in the ladle have been put eight
things: curd ({#daDi#}), honey ({#maDu#}), clarified butter ({#sarpis#}),
water proceeding from rain during sunshine, before it has fallen
down ({#AtapavarzyA ApaH;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#AtapayuktavarzaBavAH#}); blades
of {%Syāma%} grass ({#SazyARi;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#SyAmatfRAni#}), sprouts
({#tokmAni;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#aNkurARi#}), spirituous liquor ({#surA#}) and
{%Dūb%} grass ({#dUrvA,#} Panicum dactylon). (To prepare a site
for the throne three lines have been drawn on a place of
sacrifice with the sacrificial implement called {%Sphya%} (q. v.),
one southwards, another westwards and a third north-
wards); the one to the south is that on which the throne
is to be placed with its front towards the east, so that the two
[Page275-b+ 56]
feet to the north come to stand within the Vedi or sacri-
ficial ground and the two to the south without; this latter
spot occupied by the throne-seat is called {%Śrī;%} (as a type
of happiness or prosperity; {%Sāy.:%} {#SrIrvE saMpadrUpEva#}). The
place within the Vedi being small, but that without being
illimited, this position of the throne indicates that the sacri-
ficer may obtain definite and indefinite wishes within and
without the Vedi. The tiger skin is the type of increase
of Kshatriya power, for the tiger is the Kshatriya or hero
of the wild beasts; the Udumbara wood of the throne,
ladle and branch is the type of essential juice ({#Urj#} {%Sāy.:%}
= {#kzIrAdirasaH#}) and of food (which the sacrificer is sup-
posed to acquire by this symbol); curd, honey and clari-
fied butter typify the essence of water and plants; (curd and
butter, as {%Sāyaṇa%} observes, because they originate in grass
and water which are the food of cattle; honey, because it
originates in the juice of plants collected by bees); water pro-
ceeding from rain during sunshine, before it has fallen down
typifies (on account of the sunshine) lustre (or energy; {#tejas#})
and (rain being the consequence of oblations to the gods)
holiness ({#brahmavarcasam;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#SrutADyayanasaMpattiH#}); grass
and sprouts typify food ({#irA;#} they being the food of cattle),
hence prosperity ({#puzwi,#} increase) and progency ({#prajA#}); spi-
rituous liquor is the type of a Kshatriya's power (on ac-
count of its fierceness or hotness; {%Sāy.:%} {#surayA kzatriyasyEva#}
{#madayogAtkzatrarUpatvam#}) and of the essence of food (or rice,
liquor being made of rice; comp. {#annarasa; annasya rasaH;#} {%Sāy.:%}
{#annajanyatvAdannarasatvam#}); {%Dūb%} grass (being the Kshatriya of
the plants and firmly established in the soil with its many
roots) is the type of Kshatriya-power and of a firmly esta-
blished rule.--The principal features of the ceremony
itself are the following. The king who performs the sacrifice
kneels down at the back part of the throne-seat with his
face to the east and his right knee touching the ground
(while his left knee remains upwards); he then touches
with his hands the throne-seat and invites the gods to
ascend it together with various metres: {%Agni%} with the metre
Gāyatrī, {%Savitṛ%} with the Uṣṇih, {%Soma%} with the Anu-
ṣṭubh, {%Bṛhaspati%} with the Bṛhatī, {%Mitra%} and {%Varuṇa%}
with the Pankti, {%Indra%} with the Triṣṭubh, the {%Viśve-%}
{%Devās%} with the Jagatī, for the purpose of obtaining kingly
power ({#rAjyam;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#deSADipatyam#}), righteous govern-
ment ({#sAmrAjyam;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#DarmeRa pAlanam#}), increase of en-
joyment ({#BOjyam;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#BogasamfdDiH#}), independent rule
({#svArAjyam;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#aparADInatvam#}), attainment of more
distinguished qualities than those possessed by other kings
({#vErAjyam;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#itareByo BUpatiByo vESizwyam#}), coming
(after death) into the world of Brahman ({#pAramezWyam;#} {%Sāy.:%}
{#etaduktamEhikam#}--i. e. what precedes--{#aTAmuzmikamucyate .#}
{#pAramezWyaM prajApatilokaprAptiH#}) and obtaining there dominion
({#rAjyam;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#tatra rAjyamESvaryam#}), a mighty rule ({#mAhA-#}
{#rAjyam;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#tatratyeBya itareBya ADikyam#}), mastership
({#ADipatyam;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#tAnitarAnprati svAmitvam#}), indepen-
dence ({#svAvaSyam;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#apAratantyam#}) and a long resi-
dence there ({#AtizWam;#} {%Sāy.:%} {#cirakAlavAsitvam#}). [Of the
metres mentioned before each following metre has four
[Page276-a+ 56]
syllables more than each preceding one; the invitation itself
which is addressed to the gods is founded on the {%Ṛgv.%}
10. 130. 4.; and the company of the gods is solicited by the king
in order to ensure the attainment of what was before unat-
tained by him ({#yogaH;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#aprAptasya lABasya prAptiH#}) and
the preservation of what he has obtained ({#kzemaH;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#prA-#}
{#ptasya vastuno rakzaRam#}).] The gods have arrived and the king
now ascends himself the throne-seat, first with his right
and then with his left knee.--The next ceremony is the
propitiation of the liquid in the ladle, which is performed
by the priest who will pour it over the king, by reciting
the hymn: ‘waters behold me with a favourable eye, with
a favourable body touch my skin; all fires, for they reside
in water, I invoke on your account; do you produce in me
beauty, bodily strength and energy’; and by the king re-
peating these words after him. If this propitiation did not
take place, the liquid would destroy the vigour of the king.
(The quoted verse occurs, though with some variations, in
the {%Atharvav.%} 10. 1. 12 and 13.) After this, the priest covers
the head of the king with the {%Udumbara%}-branch and pours
the liquid over him while reciting the following three {%Ṛg-%}
{%veda%}-verses: ‘These waters are most propitious, they have
healing power to free from all disease ({%Sāy.%} ‘poverty and
other diseases’: {#dAridryAdirogasya BezajIH#}); they are the
augmenters of kingly power, and (therefore) its supporters;
they are immortal.’ ‘With which Prajāpati sprinkled In-
dra, the king Soma and Manu, with these I sprinkle thee,
that thou becomest king of kings in this world.’ ‘The
queen, thy mother, bore thee to be great amongst the
great, and a righteous ruler over men; an auspicious mother
bore thee’; and this {%Yajurveda%}-verse: ‘The divine Savitṛ has
given his consent, therefore I pour (this liquid) over thee
with the arms of the Aśvins ({%Sāyaṇa:%} not with my own),
with the hands of Pūṣan, with the beauty of Agni ({#tejas;#}
{%Sāy.:%} = {#SArIrakAntiH#}), with the radiance of Sūrya ({#varcas;#}
{%Sāy.:%} = {#vAhyaprakASaH#}) and with the (sharp) senses of Indra
({#indriyam;#} {%Sāy.%} ‘with the sharpness of the eyes’ &c.: =
{#cakzurAdipAwavam#}), for the sake of strength ({#balam#}), prospe-
rity ({#SrIH;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#hastyaSvAdisaMpad#}), glory and increase of
food ({#annam;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#annasamfdDiH#})’. If the priest wishes
that the king may enjoy good health (lit. may eat food),
he must, after these verses, utter the sacred word {%Bhūr!%}
(earth!). If he wishes that the king may enjoy good health
and live to see a son and a grandson ({#dvipuruza#}) he must
utter the sacred words: {%Bhūr! Bhuvas!%} (earth! intermediate
region between earth and sun!), and if he wishes him to
enjoy good health and live to see three generations ({#tri-#}
{#puruza#}), or if he wishes him to remain unrivalled, he must
utter the sacred words: {%Bhūr! Bhuvas! Swar!%} (earth! inter-
mediate region! heaven!). [The {%text%} of the {%Aitar. Br.%} men-
tions on this occasion that some authorities object to the
enunciation of the latter words; but it quotes, too, the
opinion of the Ṛṣi {%Satyakāma,%} the son of {%Jābālā,%} who
maintains that a king who is not inaugurated with these
{%Vyāhṛtis%} or sacred words, will die before the due term of
his life, and that of {%Uddālaka,%} the son of {%Aruṇa,%} who says
[Page276-b+ 56]
that a king who is inaugurated with these words, will ar-
rive at the full term of his life and conquer his enemies.]
Since at the pouring of the liquid the essence of water,
holiness and the other boons which are conferred on the
king by the ingredients placed in the ladle, are shed and
go away, as it were, from the king, he must, to secure
them, before the liquid is poured over him, make two
oblations (while uttering the words: {#brahma prapadye svAhA kzatraM#}
{#prapadye svAhA#} i. e. I am obtaining holiness, Svāhā! I am
obtaining power, Svāhā!). After the liquid has been
poured over the king, the priest places in his hand a
goblet of spirituous liquor and recites the following verse
({%Ṛgv.%} 9. 1. 1. = {%Sāmav.%} 2. 39. = {%Vājas.%} 26. 25.): ‘Soma with
thy most sweet exhilarating drops purify (this sacrificer),
for thou wast poured out for Indra to drink.’ Then he
recites and makes the king repeat after him the following
invocation: ‘(Soma and spirituous liquor), because a se-
parate residence has been allotted to you by the gods,
therefore do not combine in the lofty æther; liquor, thou
art powerful, but thou, Soma, art a king; do not harm him
(the king), when you enter into your several receptacles
(i. e. into his stomach).’ [This verse occurs with some
variations in the {%Vājas.%} 19. 7.] By the recital of these verses
spirituous liquor and Soma become identified; compare
page 279{%a,%} line 52ff. Having drunk the king then presents
the rest to a man whom he considers his friend, for drink-
ing out of the same cup is the mutual practice of friends.
He then places the Udumbara branch on the ground as a
symbol of essential juice ({#Urj#}) and food, and prepares
himself for descending from the throne-seat; but while he
is still seated and puts his feet on the ground he says: ‘I
firmly stand on heaven and earth, I firmly stand on ex-
haled and inhaled air ({#prARa#} and {#apAna#}), I firmly stand on
day and night, I firmly stand on food and drink; on what
is Brahmaṇa, on what is Kshatriya, on these three worlds
stand I firmly.’ He then descends, sits down on the ground
with his face towards the east, utters thrice the words
‘adoration to what is Brāhmaṇa’ and offers a gift ({%Sāy.:%}
a cow) to a Brāhmaṇa; the object of this gift is the at-
tainment of victory in general ({#jitiH#}), of victory every-
where ({#aBijitiH;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#aBitaH sarvezu deSezu jitiH#}); of
victory over strong and weak enemies ({#vijitiH;#} {%Sāy.:%} =
{#prabaladurbalaSatrURAM tAratamyena viviDo jayaH#}) and of complete
victory ({#saMjitiH;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#SatrutvarAhityAya samyagjayaH#}); and
his threefold expression of adoration to what is a Brāhmaṇa
implies that a kingdom prospers and has valiant men when
it is under the control of the Brāhmaṇas, and that a valiant
son will be born to him. After this ceremony the king
rises and puts fuel into the Āhavanīya fire while uttering
the words: ‘(wood) thou art fuel, bestow on me sharpness
of sense and strength of body’. Then he is going to take
three steps to the east, north (and as {%Sāy.%} explains), to the
north-cast, but previously to doing so points to the region,
and addresses the step he is about to take with these words:
‘thou subduest for me the regions; enable me therefore to
adore the gods, and may attainment of my desires and preser-
[Page277-a+ 56]
vation of what I have attained be granted to me; may there be
no danger (or fear) to me’. [The injunctions which follow in
the text of the {%Aitar. Br.%} are merely incidental and refer
to the conduct of a king and the ceremonies he has to per-
form, when his assistance in warfare is sought for by
another king.] Upon this and having recited the {%Ṛgveda%}-
verse (10. 131. 1.), with the purpose of freeing himself from
enemies, he returns to his palace, when he will be without
foes and peril and day by day increase in prosperity, au-
thority and sovereignty. There he sits down by the do-
mestic fire and the Adhwaryu priest makes for him, out
of a goblet, four times three oblations with clarified butter
to Indra while reciting the three {%Ṛgveda%}-verses 9. 110. 1-3.
or {%Sāmav.%} 2. 714. 716. 715. [The recital of these verses takes
place in a peculiar manner, called {#prapadam,#} which consists
in inserting between the syllables of some word in the
second Pāda of either of these verses certain other words
which are foreign to the text of the {%Ṛgv.%}-hymn, viz. the
words {#BUrbrahma prARamamftaM prapadyate'yamasO Sarma varmABayaM svastaye#}
{#saha prajayA saha paSuBiH#} between the second and third syl-
lables of the word {#vftrARi#} in the second Pāda of {%Ṛgv.%} 9.
110. 1.; the words {#Buvo brahma#} &c. {#…paSuBiH#} between the
second and third syllables of the word {#samaryarAjye#} in the
second Pāda of {%Ṛgv.%} 9. 110. 2.; and the words {#svarbrahma#} &c.
{#…paSuBiH#} between the first and second syllables of the
word {#SakmanA#} in the second Pāda of {%Ṛgv.%} 9. 110. 3.; the
sense of these words is: ‘he (the king) seeks the protection
of earth ({#BUr;#} in the second verse…of {#Buvas#} or the inter-
mediate region; in the third of {#svar#} or heaven), of the
Veda, of life, of Amṛta; for the sake of his bliss grant
him (o Indra) happiness, armour and safety with his
children and his cattle’.] A king for whom these libations
are made to Indra in the indicated manner becomes free
from disease, cannot be injured by enemies, is exempt
from poverty, everywhere protected against danger, and
thus becomes victorious in all the quarters, and after death
established in Indra's heaven.--At the end of the whole
ceremony the king prays for increase in cows, horses and
progeny and more especially to obtain a son who would
be liberal towards the priests at his sacrifices and a power-
ful protector of his subjects.--Priests who understand
well how to perform the whole rite will raise the king to
an exalted position; those on the contrary who are igno-
rant of the manner in which it is to be performed, will
bring him unto perdition. (As an instance of the efficacy
of this part of the Rājasūya sacrifice when performed by
priests who well understand their duties, the text of the {%Aitar.%}
{%Br.%} quotes the instance of {%Janamejaya,%} the son of {%Parīkṣit.%})
<div n="P">{%b.%} The rites of the {%Abhisheka%} which is not part of a
Rājasūya sacrifice, but a ceremony performed at a king's
accession to the throne, are similar to, but not identical
with, those of the {%Punarabhisheka;%} they are founded on
the proceedings which took place when Indra was conse-
crated by the gods as their supreme ruler, and which form
the subject of the 38<sup>th</sup> chapter of the {%Aitareya Brāhmaṇa.%}
It is there told that the throne-seat which served at Indra's
[Page277-b+ 56]
inauguration was made of {%Ṛgveda%}-verses, its eight parts
consisting of {%Sāmaveda%}-verses, viz. the two fore-legs of
the {%Bṛhat%} and {%Rathantara,%} the two hind-legs of the {%Vai-%}
{%rūpa%} and {%Vairāja,%} the two top boards of the {%Śākvara%} and
{%Raivata,%} and the two side boards of the {%Naudhasa%} and
{%Kāleya.%} [In the corresponding passage of the {%Punarabhi-%}
{%sheka, Sāyaṇa%} speaks of {%several%} {#SorzaRya#} and renders the word
‘boards placed on the legs of the throne-seat’: {#tezAM pA-#}
{#dAnAM SirasyupariBAge'vasTitAni SIrzaRyAni;#} in the pre-
sent passage the text has the dual {#SIrzaRye#} which {%Sāyaṇa%}
explains as the board where the head of Indra and, by
implication, as the board where his feet rest upon: {#Asa-#}
{#ndyAM SayAnasyendrasya SirodeSasTaM PalakaM SIrzaRyam . tacca pAda-#}
{#deSAvikftasya PalakasyApyupalakzaRam;#} {%Sāyaṇa%} likewise speaks
in his comm. on the first passage of several {#anUcya,#} while
the text of the latter mentions distinctly two, viz. {#anUcye;#}
the former explanation of {#SIrzaRya#} seems more natural, since
the latter is at variance with the dimensions of the throne-
seat stated before, but it is probably more correct to view
the compound {#SIrzaRyAnUcyAni#} which occurs in the chapter
on the Punarabhisheka, as representing two duals]; of the
threads of the texture which was to hold this structure to-
gether, those that went lengthwise were made of {%Ṛgveda%}-
and those that went crossways of {%Sāmaveda-,%} the intervals
being {%Yajurveda%}-verses; the covering of the throne was
(the goddess of) {%Glory,%} the pillow ({%Sāy.:%} where his head
rested upon) {%Śrī%} (the goddess of Happiness). {%Savītṛ%} and
{%Bṛhaspati%} supported the fore-legs, {%Vāyu%} and {%Pūṣan%} the
hind-legs, {%Mitra%} and {%Varuṇa%} the two top boards and the
two {%Aśvins%} the two side boards of the throne-seat, while
Indra ascended it after having invited the {%Vasus%} to take
place on it with the metre Gāyatrī, the Stoma (q. v.) Tri-
vṛt and the Sāman (q. v.) Rathantara for the sake of ob-
taining righteous government ({#sAmrAjya#}), the {%Rudras%} for
increase of enjoyment ({#BOjya#}), the {%Adityas%} for independent
rule ({#svArAjya#}), the {%Viśve-Devas%} for the attainment of dis-
tinguished qualities ({#vErAjya#}), the {%Sādhyas%} and {%Āptyas%} for
dominion ({#rAjya#}), the {%Maruts%} and {%Āṅgirasas%} for coming into
the world of Brahman ({#pAramezwya#}), superiority ({#mAhArAjya#}),
mastership ({#ADipatya#}), independence ({#svAvaSya#}) and a long
residence there ({#AtizWa#}), these divinities being accompanied
severally, like the Vasus, with various metres, Stomas
and Sāmans (as specified in the text of the {%Ait. Br.%}). All
these gods having then proclaimed the high qualities of
Indra, to strike terror, by their panegyric, into the mind
of his enemies, and Prajāpati who performed the function
of inaugurating priest, having recited the {%Ṛgveda%}-verse 1.
25. 10. (where between the ending words {#sAmrAjyAya#} and
{#sukratuH#} the words {#BOjyAya, svArAjyAya#} &c. &c. are inserted),
the latter placed himself before (i. e. east of) the throne with
his face towards the west, covered the head of Indra with a
moist {%Udumbara%} branch (i. e. with an Udumbara branch the
leaves of which had been wetted) and a gold Pavitra (q. v.)
and sprinkled him with the liquid, while reciting the three
{%Ṛgveda%}-verses ‘these waters &c.’, the {%Yajurveda%}-verse
‘the divine Savitṛ &c.’ and uttering the three sacred words,
[Page278-a+ 56]
{%Bhūr, Bhuvas, Swar%} (see above page 276 {%a,%} line 22 ff.). Thirty-
one days after this inauguration by Prajāpati, the divine
{%Vasus%} sprinkled him in the East with the same liquid while
reciting the same verses and uttering the same sacred words,
to ensure his righteous government ({#sAmrAjya#}), hence the
inaugurated kings of the Eastern peoples are called {%Samrāj;%}
next in thirty-one days the {%Rudras%} performed the same
ceremony in the South to ensure his increase of enjoyment
({#BOjya#}), hence the inaugurated kings of the {%Satwats%} in the
South are called {%Bhoja;%} then in other thirty-one days the
{%Ādityas%} performed this ceremony in the West, to ensure
his independent rule ({#svArAjya#}), hence the inaugurated kings
of the {%Nīchyas%} and {%Apāchyas%} in the West are called {%Svarāj;%}
then in other thirty-one days, the {%Viśve-Devas%} in the North,
to ensure his attainment of higher qualities than those pos-
sessed by others ({#vErAjya#}), hence the inaugurated kings of
the {%Uttarakurus%} and {%Uttaramadras%} are called {%Virāj;%} after-
wards in other thirty-one days the {%Sādhyas%} and {%Āptyas%}
performed the same ceremony in the central region (which
is the ‘fixed’ region, since east, west &c. become deter-
mined through it, and which at the same time is the region
where the vaidik rites are established), for the sake of his
rulership ({#rAjya#}), hence the inaugurated kings of the {%Kurus%}
and {%Pañchālas%} and of the {%Vaśas%} and {%Uśīnaras%} in that re-
gion are called {%Rājan.%} Lastly, in further thirty-one days the
{%Maruts%} and the {%Angirasas%} performed this ceremony in the upper
region (or Swarga) to ensure his attainment of the supreme
abode ({#pAramezWya#}), his mighty rule there over every one
({#mAhArAjya#}), as well as his mastership ({#ADipatya#}), inde-
pendence ({#svAvaSya#}) and long residence there ({#AtizWa#}), hence
he attained the supreme abode ({#paramezWin#}) and became
united with Prajāpati ({#prAjApatya#}). ‘Thus inaugurated by
that great inauguration Indra conquered all conquerable
battle grounds ({#jitIH;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#jetavyAH sarvA yudDaBUmIH#}),
took possession of all worlds, obtained the highest dignity
amongst gods ({#SrEzWyam;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#atiSayena praSastatvam#}), trans-
cendent rank ({#atizWAm;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#sarvAnatikramyAvasTAnam#})
and preeminence ({#paramatAm;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#utkfzwatvam#}), conquered
righteous government, increase of enjoyment, absolute do-
minion, distinguished qualities, supreme abode, rulership
and mighty rule and mastership there; and thus he became
in this world a Prajāpati, an absolute king, long-lived
({#amftaH;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#itaramanuzyavadalpakAle maraRarahitaH#}), and
in the other world having obtained all his desires, he be-
came entirely exempt from death’ (or liberated; {#amftaH;#}
{%Sāy.:%} = {#maraRarahito muktaH#}).
<div n="P">The purpose for which the inauguration of a mortal king
takes place, is defined by the {%Aitar. Br.%} in precisely the
same terms as those contained in the preceding passage,
[with the obvious alteration of ‘amongst kings’ instead of
‘amongst gods’. This definition occurs ch. 39. 5.; in the
commencement of ch. 39. 1. the purpose of the ceremony is
worded somewhat differently at the end of the passage but
its bearing is similar, viz.: if he (i. e. a priest) wishes that
a king should conquer all conquerable battle grounds &c.
&c…(up to the words: ‘and mastership there’), that
[Page278-b+ 56]
he should attain (every thing) in space and time ({#ayaM#}
{#samantaparyAyI syAt;#} {%Sāy.:%} {#deSataH kAlataH sarvavyApI syAt#}),
all land up to the seashore and all life to infinity (lit.
to the amount {#parArDa; sArvaBOmaH sArvAyuza AntAdA pa-#}
{#rArDAt;#} {%Sāy.:%} {#samudratIraparyantaM sArvaBOmatvaM deSavyAptiH . A#}
{#parArDAtparArDaSabdABiDeyakAlasaMKyAparyantaM sArvAyuzatvaM kAla-#}
{#vyAptiH#}), and that he should become a sole ruler over the
whole earth up to the ocean ({#pfTivyE samudraparyantAyA eka-#}
{#rAw#}), let him &c. &c…and: if a king wishes, that he
should conquer &c. &c., let him &c.].--The ceremony as
practised at the {%vaidik period,%} is thus described in the {%Ait.%}
{%Br.%} The priest in the commencement of the solemnity
causes the king to take the following oath: ‘if I (the king)
do ever harm to thee, thou (the priest) mayst deprive me
of all pious acts ({#izwApUrtam;#} {%Sāy.:%} {#SrOtasmArtadvayam#}) which
I have done from the time of my birth up to that of my
death, of heaven and whatever else good has been accom-
plished by me, of long life and offspring’. He then orders
his attendants to bring four kinds of fruits: the fruit of
the {%Nyagrodha%} (ficus Indica), of the {%Udumbara%} (ficus glo-
merata), of the {%Aśvattha%} (ficus religiosa) and of the {%Plaksha%}
(ficus infectoria); besides, four kinds of grain ({#OzaDAni#}
{#…tokmakftAni;#} {%Sāy.:%} {#aNkuranimittAnyOzaDidravyARi#}):
rice with small grain ({#vrIddIRAm;#} {%Sāy.:%} {#sUkzmavIjarUpA vrI-#}
{#hayaH#}), rice with large grain ({#mahAvrIhIRAm;#} {%Sāy.:%} {#prOQa-#}
{#vIjarUpA mahAvrIhayaH#}), {%Priyangu%} and barley. Next they
bring, at his command, a throne-seat of {%Udumbara%} wood
(made in the manner as described above, page 275{%a,%} line 34 ff.),
a (four-cornered) ladle of {%Udumbara%} or, instead of the latter,
a vessel of {%Udumbara%} (or, acc. to {%Sāyaṇa,%} an earthen vessel
of an arbitrary shape) and an {%Udumbara%} branch. Then they
put the four kinds of fruit and grain in the ladle or vessel
and pour over them curds, honey, clarified butter and water
proceeding from rain during sunshine, before it has fallen
down; afterwards, having placed the ladle or vessel on the
ground, they address the throne-seat with a Mantra which
recalls the component parts of Indra's throne and thus
tends to identify both: ‘may thy front legs be Bṛhat and
Rathantara &c. &c.; may Savitṛ and Bṛhaspati support
thy fore-legs &c. &c. (see above page 277{%b,%} line 1 ff.)’. Then
the priest asks the king to ascend the throne-seat, inviting
the Vasus, Rudras, Ādityas and the other divinities which
were invited by Indra at his inauguration (see page 277{%b,%}
line 31 ff.), to ascend his throne with the same metres, Stomas
and Sāmans and for the same purposes as mentioned above.
Upon this the relatives of the king (literally: ‘the king-
makers’, {#rAjakartAraH;#} {%Sāy.:%} = {#pitfBrAtrAdayaH#} ‘father, bro-
ther &c.’), proclaim his high qualities in the same words
as the gods proclaimed the greatness of Indra; the priest
recites the {%Ṛgveda%}-verse 1. 25. 10. (with the same modifica-
tions as mentioned above) and, placing himself before the
throne with his face towards the west, covers the head of the
king with the Udumbara branch, the leaves of which have
been wetted, and with a gold Pavitra, and sprinkles him
with the liquid (in the ladle or vessel), while reciting the
three {%Ṛgveda%}-verses, the {%Yajurveda%}-verse and uttering the
[Page279-a+ 56]
three sacred words mentioned above (page 276{%a,%} line 22 ff.).
Lastly he addresses the king with the prayer that the Vasus,
the Rudras and the other divinities who performed this cere-
mony for Indra in the East, South &c. may severally do the
same for him in thirty-one successive days and to the same
effect as mentioned before (page 278{%a,%} line 1 ff.).--The in-
gredients of the sacred liquid used at this Abhisheka differ in
some measure, as will have been seen, from those used at
the {%Punarabhisheka;%} they differ from the latter also in their
typical qualities. The {%Nyagrodha%} being on account of its
wide spread the Rājan of the trees, and rice with small
grain being among plants principally productive of strength,
the fruit of the former and the grain of the latter are the
type of the qualities of a Kshatra ({#kzatram#}), which the king
is supposed to acquire by these ingredients; and in a si-
milar manner the fruit of the {%Udumbara%} and the grains of
{%Priyangu%} are the type of increase of enjoyment ({#BOjyam#}),
the fruit of the {%Aśvattha%} and rice with large grains the
type of righteous government ({#sAmrAjyam#}), the fruit of the
{%Plaksha%} the type of independent rule ({#svArAjyam#}) and at-
tainment of more distinguished qualities than those pos-
sessed by other kings ({#vErAjyam#}), barley the type of mi-
litary commandership ({#sEnAnyam#}); curds typify the sharpness
of senses ({#indriyam;#} {%Sāy.:%} ‘because they make the senses
sharp’: {#indriyapAwavahetutvAt#}), honey typifies the essence
of plants and trees ({#rasa ozaDivanaspatizu;#} {%Sāy.:%} ‘because
it originates in flowers’: {#puzpajanyatvena#}); clarified butter, the
brightness of cattle ({#tejaH paSUnAm;#} {%Sāy.:%} ‘on account of its
oily gloss’: {#snigDaBAskaratvena#}) and the water, freedom from
death or long life ({#amftam;#} {%Sāy.:%} ‘because it nourrishes’
{#ApyAyanahetutvAt#}).--The ceremony having been completed,
the king has to make a present to the inaugurating priest, viz.
a thousand (Nishkas) of gold, a field and cattle ({#catuzpAd;#}
{%Sāy.:%} {#gavAdikam#} cows &c.); but this amount seems merely
to constitute a minimum acknowledgement of the exertions
of the priest; for the text of the Aitareya adds that ‘they
say, a king should give innumerable, illimited presents,
since a king is illimited (in wealth) and thus will obtain
illimited benefit to himself’; and the author of the {%Aitar.%}
{%Br.%} seems rather inclined to adopt the latter opinion, for,
amongst the instances he gives of royal inaugurations which
have been performed in this fashion, he does not mention
such at which the Brāhmaṇas received the ‘limited’ gifts,
but tells, e. g., that {%Udamaya,%} the son of Atri, promised
to his priest ten thousand elephants and ten thousand
female slaves and gave each of the sons of that priest every
day at the noon-oblation two thousand cows out of a
thousand millions; that {%Anga%} gave his priest eighty thou-
sand young white horses fit for carrying burdens on their
back &c.; that {%Bharata%} distributed in Maṣṇāra a hundred
and seven thousand millions of black elephants with white
tucks and decked with gold &c. &c. (comp. also {%Colebr.%}
{%Ess.%} I. p. 41 ff.).--After the priest has received the gift,
he hands to the king a goblet of spirituous liquor in re-
citing the verse: ‘Soma with thy most sweet exhilarating
drops &c.’ (see above p. 276{%b,%} line 13ff.), and the king drinks
[Page279-b+ 56]
of it after having recited this verse: ‘what is left (in this
goblet) of the tasteful liquid and what Indra (drank when
it was consecrated by) various rites, that portion of it I
consume now with a placid mind, (as if it were) the royal
Soma’, and this verse: ‘to thee, supreme (Indra), I offer
this liquid for drink, for it has been poured out on thy
behalf, rejoice in it until thou art happy’; [the former of
these mantras occurs with a few variations in the {%Vājas.,%}
19. 35., the other in the {%Ṛgv.,%} 8. 45. 22. or {%Sāmav.,%} 1. 161.].
By this manner of drinking, the spirituous liquor becomes
a kind of Soma, and it is the Soma not the spirituous liquor
that is drunk by the king. Lastly the king recites the two
{%Ṛgveda%}-verses 8. 48. 3. and 4. [What follows in the text of
the {%Aitareya Br.%} up to the end of the 39<sup>th</sup> ch. are illustra-
tations of the happiness which is felt by a king in conse-
quence of such an inauguration, and historical instances of
kings who had this ceremony performed for them and be-
stowed liberal gifts on the functioning priests; for this
portion of the text compare also the literal translation of
it in {%Colebrooke'%}s {%Essays%} 1. p. 39 seqq.--
<div n="P">Inaugurations of a purely mythical nature are mentioned
in the {%Upanishads, Epic poems%} and in the {%Purāṇas;%} thus the
{%Harivaṇsa%} reports, ch. 109, an inauguration of {%Kṛṣṇa,%} the
{%Śalyap.%} of the {%Mahābh.,%} ch. 48, that of Varuṇa; a whole list
is given in the {%Viṣṇup.%} 1. ch. 22 (where a note of {%Wilson%}
refers to the corresponding passages in other {%Purāṇas%}); com-
pare also {%Bṛhadār. Up.%} 1. 4. 11. One of the completest lists
of this kind is that which occurs in the 4th chapter, and is
varied in the 227<sup>th</sup> chapter, of the {%Harivanśa.%} According to
the former, {%Soma%} was inaugurated as king of the Brāhmaṇas

the son of {%Rajas,%} of the West; and {%Hiraṇyaroman,%} the son

{%Prīthu%} as king of kings.--The other list (ch. 227) is si-
milar, but it represents {%Śiva%} as becoming the inaugurated
king of the Piśāchas and other evil genii, of the Matṛs,
cows, meteors, planets, diseases, pests, calamities and
ghosts; {%Vaiśravaṇa,%} of the Yakshas, Rākṣasas, Guhykas,

<div n="P">The type of the inauguration ceremony as practised at
the {%Epic period%} may probably be recognized in the history
of the inauguration of {%Rāma,%} as told in the {%Rāmāyaṇa,%}
and in that of the inauguration of {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} as told in
the {%Mahābhārata.%} Neither ceremony is described in these
poems with the full detail which is given of the vaidik rite
in the {%Aitar. Br.;%} but the allusion that {%Rāma%} was inau-
gurated by {%Vasiṣṭha%} and the other Brāhmaṇas in the same
manner as Indra by the Vasus ({%Yuddhakāṇḍa:%} {#vasizWo vA-#}
{#madevaSca#} &c. {#…aByaziYcannaravaraM prasannena suganDinA . sali-#}
{#lena sahasrAkzaM vasavo vAsavaM yaTA#}) and the observation which
is made in some passages that a certain rite of the inau-
guration was performed ‘according to the sacred rule’
({%Yuddhak.:%} {#SAstradfzwena viDinA sa tadA viDivaddvijaH rAGa-#}
{#vasyABizekArTaM sa dvijeByo nyavedayat;#} {%Śāntiparv.:%} {#juhAva pA-#}
{#bakaM DImAnviDimantrapuraskftam#} or {#pUjayAmAsa tAMScApi viDi-#}
{#vadBUridakziRaH#}), admit of the conclusion that the ceremony
was supposed to have taken place in conformity with the
vaidik injunction. This inference is confirmed moreover
by another passage of the {%Śāntīp.%} (v. 2496) which says
‘that inaugurating a king is a chief duty of the people of
a country…for the Veda states: because they chose
Indra for their king &c…’ ({#rAzwrasyEtatkftyatamaM rAjYa evA-#}
{#Bizecanam…indrameva pravfRute yadrAjAnamiti SrutiH#} &c.;
{%Arjunam.%} {#rAzwrasya = asya deSavAsino lokasya#}). Yet it re-
sults from the description given in the Epic poems that the
vaidik ceremony had undergone various modifications at
the time of their composition.--As the inauguration of
{%Rāma%} was intended and the necessary preparations for it
were made, when his father {%Daśaratha%} was still alive, but
as the ceremony itself, through the intrigues of his step-
mother {%Kaikeyī,%} did not take place then, but fourteen years
later, after the death of {%Daśaratha,%} an account of the pre-
[Page280-b+ 56]
paratory ceremonies is given in the {%Ayodhyākāṇda%} as well
as in the {%Yuddhakāṇḍa%} of the Rāmāyaṇa, but an account
of the complete ceremony in the latter book alone. Accord-
ing to the {%Ayodhyāk.%} on the day preceding the intended inau-
guration {%Rāma%} and his wife {%Sītā%} held a fast, and in the night
they performed this preliminary rite: {%Rāma,%} having made
his ablutions, approached the idol of Nārāyaṇa, took a
cup of clarified butter, as the religious law prescribes ({#vi-#}
{#Divat#}), made a libation of it into the kindled fire and drank
the remainder while wishing what was agreeable to his
heart. Then, with his mind fixed on the divinity, he lay,
silent and composed, together with {%Sītā,%} on a bed of Kuśa-
grass, which was spread before the altar of Viṣṇu, until
the last watch of the night, when he awoke and ordered
the palace to be prepared for the solemnity. At day-break,
reminded of the time by the voices of the bards, he per-
formed the usual morning devotion and praised the divinity.
In the mean time the town Ayodhyā had assumed a festive
appearance and the inauguration implements had been ar-
ranged: a beautiful golden throne-seat ({#BadrAsana#} or {#siM-#}
{#hAsana,#} also called in other passages {#BadrapIWa;#} the vaidik

from the confluence of the Ganges and Jumna as well as from
other sacred rivers in all directions and from all oceans,
golden jars filled with shoots of the {%Udumbara%} tree and
various lotus flowers ({#padmotpala#}), {%Ruchakas%} (citrons?) and
{%Rochanas%} (pomegranates?), clarified butter, honey, milk,
curd, as well as soil, water and other propitious objects
taken from places of pilgrimage ({#tIrTa#}), a white pearl
sceptre, a {%chowri%} ({#cAmara#}), a fan, and a white parasol
decorated with beautiful garlands; besides, a white bull, a
white horse and a splendid, furious elephant ({#matto gajavaraH#}),
also eight beautiful damsels in fine attire, all kinds of mu-
sical instruments and bards in festive dress. [This is the
account according to the text of the {%Rāmāyaṇa%} in Mr. {%Gor-%}
{%resio'%}s edition; the edition of {%Schlegel,%} mentions (2. 15. 4-12)
the following implements and in the following order: golden
waterjars, an ornamented throne-seat, a chariot covered
with a splendid tiger-skin, water taken from the confluence
of the Ganges and Jumna, as well as from other sacred
rivers, tanks, wells, lakes and from all oceans, honey,
curd, clarified butter, fried grain ({#lAjAH#}), Kuśa grass,
flowers, milk; besides, eight beautiful damsels and a splen-
did, furious elephant; golden and silver jars, filled with
water, covered with {%Udumbara%} branches ({#kzIriBiSCannAH#})
and various lotus flowers; besides a white, jewelled {%chowrie%}
({#bAlavyajana#}), a white splendid parasol, a white bull, a
white horse, all manners of musical instruments and bards.
A similar enumeration occurs in the preceding chapter
v. 32 ff. of the same edition where the throne-seat is defined
as ‘made of {%Udumbara%} wood’, the chariot as ‘drawn by
four horses’, the bull as ‘accoutred with golden ropes, full-
grown (lit. having its hump) and white’, and the horse as
‘strong and having four large teeth’; there are mentioned
also {%two%} white {%chowries,%} instead of one, and all kinds
of seeds, perfumes and jewels, a scimitar ({#nistriMSa#}), a
[Page281-a+ 56]
bow, a litter ({#vAhanaM narasaMyuktam;#} comm. = {#SivikAdi#}), a gol-
den vase ({#BfNgAraM hiraRmayam#}) and a blazing fire, and amongst
the living implements of the pageant, instead of the bards,
gaudy courtezans, and besides the eight damsels: ‘profes-
sors of divinity ({#AcAryAH#}), Brāhmaṇas, cows and pure
kinds of wild beasts and birds, the chiefs of town-and
country-people and the citizens with their train’.--The
whole passage however (2. 14. 32-39.) seems to be an inter-
polation in the speech of {%Vasiṣṭha,%} at variance with the
hurry of his message to the king and made superfluous
by the narrative of the following chapter.] The {%Yuddha-%}
{%kāṇḍa%} mentions of implements only a jewelled throne-seat
({#ratnamayaM pIWam#}) and four golden jars ornamented with
jewels in which four monkey chiefs, the allies of {%Rāma%} in
his war against {%Rāvaṇa,%} carried water from the ocean of
the four regions; {%Ṛṣabha%} carried it from the southern
ocean, his jar being filled with red sandal branches, {%Jāmbavat%}
from the western ocean, his jar being ornamented with aloe
shoots; {%Vegadarśin%} from the northern ocean, his jar being
decorated with large branches (of what tree, is not said),
and {%Suṣeṇa%} from the eastern ocean, his jar being orna-
mented with bracelets ({#? aNgadakeyUrEH#}).--Of the ceremony
itself it is said that it was performed in the fashion of
Indra's inauguration, but a first difference which, to judge
from the scanty detail of the text, appears to exist between
the manner in which the ceremony was conducted at the
epic and that in which it is conducted in the vaidik period,
is that the wife of Rāma shares in a portion of the cere-
monies and in a seat on the throne with her husband, while
a participation of the wife of the king in the ceremony is
not mentioned in the {%Aitar. Br.;%} and a second and still
more important difference results from the circumstance that
not merely {%Vasiṣṭha,%} the officiating priest, sprinkled Rāma
with the consecrated liquid, but after him ‘{%Vāmadeva, Jā-%}
{%bāli, Vijaya, Kāśyapa, Gotama, Kātyāyana, Viśvāmitra%} and
other eminent Brāhmaṇas; moreover, after them, in suc-
cession, the assistant priests, the damsels, the military
chiefs and the citizens, the gods shedding over him from
the sky the essence of all plants’; for although the Vasus
and other gods sprinkled Indra with the liquid, to inau-
gurate him as king of the several heavenly quarters, no
mention is made in the vaidik ceremony, as applied to a
mortal king, that any one else but the officiating priest
inaugurated the king with the sacred liquid, or that the
active share of the assembly in the ceremony goes beyond
their eulogizing the good qualities of the king. A com-
parison, besides, between the implements of inauguration
at the two periods and between the ingredients which con-
stitute the consecration-liquid of the vaidik and that of
the epic ceremony, show that the typical quality of the
former had, in a great measure, been lost sight of at the
period of the epic poems.--The same and other de-
viations are apparent in the account which is given in
the {%Śāntiparvan%} of the {%Mahābhārata,%} of {%Yudhisṭhira'%}s inau-
guration: ‘Free from anger and pain the royal son of {%Kuntī%}
sat down joyfully on the golden throne-seat ({#paramAsana#}),
[Page281-b+ 56]
his face turned towards the east; in front of him took their
seat on a beautiful golden stool ({#pIWa#}) the valiant {%Sātyaki%} and
{%Vāsudeva;%} at either side of him, on fine-shaped jewelled
stools the noble {%Bhīmasena%} and {%Arjuna;%} on a sumptuous
ivory throne-seat embellished with gold (but acc. to a comm.
‘on a sumptuous {%solid%} throne-seat’; {#dAnte siMhAsane,#} {%Arju-%}
{%nam.:%} {#dAnte saMharzakzame#}), {%Prithā%} with {%Sahadeva%} and {%Nakula,%}
and on seats as brilliant as fire separately {%Sudharman%} (the
priest of Duryodhana) {%Vidura, Dhaumya%} and {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%}
as well as the pugnacious {%Sanjaya%} and the illustrious
{%Gāndhārī,%} all entering from the side whence came {%Dhṛta-%}
{%rāṣṭra.%} But the righteous king having taken his seat,
touched with his fingers white flowers, auspicious emblems
({#svastikAn#}), fried grain ({#akzatAn#}), the soil, gold, silver
and a pearl; when all his subjects, headed by the house
priest, became aware that he had thus possessed himself in
an auspicious manner of earth, gold and the various kinds of
jewels. The implements of the inauguration prepared and
ready, were: filled jars made of gold, {%Udumbara%} wood,
silver and clay, flowers, fried grain ({#lAjAH#}), sacrificial
grass ({#barhis#}), cow's milk, fuel of {%Śami%} (Acacia suma)-,
{%Aśvattha%} (Ficus religiosa)-, and {%Palāśa%} (Butea frondosa)-
wood, honey and clarified butter, a ladle ({#Sruva#}) made of
{%Udumbara%}-wood, and a conch ({#SaNKa#}) ornamented with gold.
Then, in obedience to the orders of {%Kṛṣṇa, Dhaumya,%} the
family priest, marked the sacrificial ground with a line in
the direction of north-east ({#prAgudakplavane vedIM lakzaRenopaliKya#}
{#ca#}), requested the noble king and the dark daughter of
{%Drupada%} to be seated on the white, solid-legged throne-seat
({#sarvatoBadra Asane;#} comp. {#BadrAsana, BadrapIWa#}) which was
brilliant like fire and covered over with a tiger-skin, and
made a libation into fire while reciting the appropriate
mantras ({#juhAva pAvakaM DImAnviDimantrapuraskftam#}). Upon
this {%Kṛṣṇa%} took his venerated conch and sprinkled (with
its contents) {%Yudhiṣṭhira,%} the son of Kuntī, (inaugurating
him thus) as lord of the earth, and after him {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra,%}
the royal Ṛṣi (sprinkled the king) and then all his sub-
jects’.--The present made at this occasion by {%Yudhi-%}
{%ṣṭhira%} consisted of a thousand Nishkas he gave to the
Brāhmaṇas (somewhat in conformity with the injunction of
the {%Aitar. Br.%}); but the liberality of {%Rāma%} was more re-
markable: he gave the Brāhmaṇas a million milch cows,
ten thousand bulls and three hundred millions Nishkas, be-
sides carts, ornaments, cloths, beds and seats, and nu-
merous villages; he made liberal presents, too, to the
monkey chiefs and the monkeys, his allies.--It is, worthy
of note, that a custom is met with, in the epic poems, the
origin of which cannot with certainty be traced to the in-
junctions of the {%Aitareya Brāhmaṇa,%} viz. a king's having a son
or relative of his inaugurated as {#yuvarAja#} (also {#yuvarAjan#}) or
‘junior king’. For, although {%Sāyaṇa'%}s commentary speaks
of ‘a father, brother &c.’ who eulogize the king before the
priest sprinkles him with the sacred liquid, and although the
presence of the father at the ceremony {%might%} countenance
the inference that the vaidik text implies also the inau-
guration of a {%Yuvarāja,%} it must be observed that the text
[Page282-a+ 56]
of the Brāhmaṇa does not contain the quoted words
but in their stead the term {#rAjakartAraH#} ‘king-makers’,
which may or may not comprise the paternal relationship.
On the other hand it must be admitted that the vaidik in-
junction is not at variance with this ceremony, which, once
performed, seems to hold good for the inauguration of the
prince at his accession to the throne, after the father's
death, since no mention is made, in the epic poems, of a
repetition of the ceremony. The object of the inauguration
of a prince as {%Yuvarāja%} is to secure to him the right of
succession, and, besides, the advantages supposed to arise
from the religious ceremony, as mentioned before, a share
in the government, or perhaps all the privileges of a
reigning king. For when {%Daśaratha%} intends to make his
son {%Rāma%} a {%Yuvarāja,%} he addresses him with these words
(in the {%Āyodhyākāṇḍa%}): ‘Rāma, I am old; I have lived
long and enjoyed every pleasure I desired; hundreds of
sacrifices I have performed when I distributed food and
liberal presents; thou wast born the son of my desire, for
no one is equal to thee on earth; thus I have paid my
debt to the gods, the Ṛṣis, my deceased ancestors, the
Brāhmaṇas and my own self; nothing remains for me to
be done save inaugurating thee; therefore what I am about
to tell thee, thou must do. To day all my subjects want
thee for their king; therefore, my son, I shall inaugurate
thee as junior king’; and {%Rāma%} reports to his mother:
‘mother, I am ordered by my father to undertake the
government of the country; to-morrow my inauguration
will take place, for such is the behest of my father’. An-
other instance of the installation as {%Yuvarāja%} is that of
{%Yudhiṣṭhira%} by {%Dhṛtarāṣṭra%} ({%Ādip.%} v. 5517), or of {%Bhīma-%}
{%sena%} by his brother {%Yudhiṣṭhira%} ({%Śāntip.%} v. 1475); one of
a simultaneous inauguration of a king and of his son, is
that of {%Dyumatsena%} as king and of his son as {%Yuvarāja;%}
({%Vanap.:%} {#tato'BizizicuH prItyA dyumatsenaM purohitAH . putraM#}
{#cAsya mahAtmAnaM yOvarAjye'Bizecayan#}).
<div n="P">The inauguration ceremony at the {%Paurāṇic%} period has
but little affinity with the vaidik rite; it is a series of pro-
ceedings which are founded on late superstitions and reflect
scarcely any of the ideas which are the groundwork of the
ceremony of the {%Aitar. Br.%} A description--though a
loose and desultory one--of the {%Paurāṇic Abhisheka%} oc-
curs in the 209<sup>th</sup> chapter of the {%Agni-Purāṇa.%} It commences
with the injunction that a king should before his inaugura-
tion choose his astrologer ({#sAMvatsara#}), his family-priest
({#purohita#}), his officiating-priest ({#ftvij#}), his ministers
({#mantrin#}) and his queen ({#mahizI#}). [Comp. {%Manu%} 7. 77 &c.]
The astrologer fixes the proper time for the inauguration
(comp. page 284{%b,%} line 51 ff.); the king takes a bath prepared
with Sesamum and white mustard seeds ({#tilEH sidDArTakEH#}
{#snAnam#}); the astrologer and the family-priest hail the king
with the cry of ‘victory’, and he being seated on a throne-
seat ({#BadrAsana#}) makes a proclamation of peace or public
safety and grants freedom to his prisoners. Then before
his inauguration by the family-priest takes place, he ad-
dresses a propitiatory prayer to Indra, and fasting on the
[Page282-b+ 56]
day of the inauguration makes libations to the Manus &c. (?)
and pays respect to a sacrificial jar which is placed on the
right or southern side of the sacrificial fire, with perfumes
and flowers. [The text of this passage in the two Mss. of
the {%Agni-P.%} at London, that alone contain a description of
the ceremony and could be consulted by me, is very cor-
rupt; the Ms. of the Royal As. Soc. in Devan. char. reads:

at the same time, as a specimen of the indifferent state of
both Mss.--that of the R. S. being however the better
of the two--which made it necessary to renounce a
{%literal%} translation of the {%whole%} chapter.] The flame of this
fire should go rightwards, it should be bright like melted
gold, crackle like carts or thunder(?), be clear (or smoke-
less), scent the air, be like the sign Swastika, have an
uninterrupted, large flame and be free from sparks; no
cats, wild beasts or birds should pass over the sacrificial
ground [Mss.: {#pradakziRAvartaSiKastu taptajAmbunadapraBaH . raTO-#}

The king, to prepare himself for the inauguration, purifies
his head with soil taken from the top of a mountain, his
ears with soil from the top of an ant-hill ({#valmIkAgramfdA#}),
his mouth with soil from a temple of Viṣṇu, his neck with
soil from a temple of Indra, his breast with soil from a
royal court yard ({#nfpAjirAt#}), his right arm with soil thrown
up by the horns of a bull ({#vfzaSfNgodDftamfdA#}), his back with
soil from a lake, his belly with soil from the two banks
of a river, his hips with soil taken from the door of a brothel
({#veSyAdvAramfdA rAjYaH kawiSOcaM viDIyate#}), his thighs with
soil from a sacrificial spot ({#yajYasTAnAt;#} but Ms. R. A. S. from
a cowpen: {#gosTAnAt,#} which word however occurs im-
mediately again), his knees with soil from a cowpen, his
legs with soil from a horse-stable, his feet with soil from
a cart-wheel; and the soil itself he washes off with {%Pancha-%}
{%gavya%} (a compound of five articles derived from the cow:
milk, curd, clarified butter, cow's urine and cow-dung). After
this purification four ministers sprinkle the king who is
seated on the throne: first the Brāhmaṇa minister with
clarified butter out of a golden jar which stands east of the
throne, then the Kshatriya minister with milk out of a
silver jar which stands south, next the Vaiśya minister
with curds out of a copper jar which stands west, and
lastly the Śūdra minister with water out of an earthen jar
which stands north of the throne [{#…BadrAsanagataM nfpam .#}

{#mAtyo'Bizecayet#}]. After them a Brāhmaṇa versed in the
Ṛgveda sprinkles him with honey and one who knows
how to chant the Sāmaveda with Kuśagrass-water. Then
the family-priest goes to the golden jar (mentioned above
page 282{%b,%} line 2) and commits the sacrificial fire in the
prescribed manner and with the appropriate hymns to the
care of the Brāhmaṇas who assist him. [Ms. R. S.: {#saMpI-#}

done so, he repairs to the part of the sacrificial ground
where the throne stands (?, liter. to the {#vedimUlam,#} root
of the sacrificial ground), and sprinkles the head of the
king with the liquid out of a golden vase perforated with
hundreds of holes while reciting verses referring to the sub-
stances which together with water, constitute the liquid,
viz. herbs, perfumes, flowers, seeds, jewels (or pearls,
probably reduced to powder) and Kuśagrass; and his throat
(Ms. R. A. S.: his hip) with water taken from various
places of pilgrimage and mixed with Rochanā; the Brāhma-
ṇas holding before the king, while the music plays, the
jar which contains the annuals, together with the {%chowrie,%}
the fan and the other emblems of royalty. [The greater
portion of the passage describing this rite is again so cor-
rupt in both Mss. that the meaning of some words and the
exact nature of the verses alluded to by the quotation of

butter and other auspicious objects placed before a looking
glass (? comp. page 286{%a,%} line 29), his family-priest, after a
prayer to Viṣṇu, Brahman and other divinities and having
prepared dishes of curds, clarified butter, honey &c., binds
the head of the king with a fillet and fastens on it the
tiara, while the king is seated on a couch covered over
with a tiger-skin. He then orders a (white?) bull, a white
horse (?) and an elephant to be led in, caparisoned severally
with a panther- (?), a lion-and a tiger-skin. [Mss.: {#taM#}

Presently the door-keeper ushers in the ministers, coun-
sellors &c.; the king presents the astrologer and the family-
priest with cows, goats, sheep and similar gifts, offers to
the other Brāhmaṇas gold and such like presents, circum-
ambulates the fire in keeping his right side towards it and
makes a bow before his Guru. He further salutes respect-
fully the bull, in patting it on the back, also the elephant,
which he does not mount; but the horse he mounts, and
having rode on it round his city (in keeping his right side
towards it), while the royal passage is lined with soldiers,
he enters it and dismisses gracefully all the people with
marks of his favour. [The Ms. of the R. S. however con-
denses the latter passage thus: ‘the door-keeper ushers in
the ministers, counsellors &c. and he dismisses gracefully
all the people with gifts of cows, goats, sheep &c.’;

following, 210<sup>th</sup> chapter of the {%Agni-Purāṇa%} contains the
invocations or, as the text calls them, {%mantras%} which are
to be recited at the inauguration ({#rAjadevAdyaBizekamantrAnvakzye#}
{#'GamardanAn . kumBAtkuSodakEH#})--R. A. S.: {#kumBAnkumBodakEH--#}
{#siYcettena saMrvaM hi siDyati#}). These {%mantras%} have nothing in
common with those recited at the vaidik ceremony; they
contain merely an enumeration of gods, demons, saints,
mountains, rivers &c. even of literary works, which are
asked to sprinkle the king, to grant him victory and to
protect him; the order in which all these beings and objects
are paraded, is of the same senseless kind, and the nomen-
clature of the same tedious description as they not uncom-
conly occur in those works which exhibit a caricature of
the ancient Hindu religion,--in the Purāṇas. It will suf-
fice to give as a specimen the following verses of the forty
and some Ślokas which form the subject of this chapter:
‘may the gods sprinkle thee, and Brahman, Viṣṇu, Śiva,
Vāsudeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna, Aniruddha; may the

vedas, viz. Āyurveda, Gandharvaveda, and Dhanurveda,
the Angas, viz. Śikṣā, Kalpa, Vyākaraṇa, Nirukta, the
science of the luminous bodies ({#jyotizAM gatiH#}) and
Chhandas [see s. v. {#aNga#}], the Vedas [here mentioned again,
like the Angas], the Mīmānsā-and Nyāya-systems ({#mI-#}
{#mAMsAnyAyavistaraH#}), and the old Dharmaśāstra ({#DarmaSAstraM#}
{#purARaM ca#}); for these are the fourteen sciences [i. e. the four
Vedas, the six Angas, the Purāṇas as eleventh, the Mī-
mānsā, Nyāya and law]; the Sāṅkhya-and Yoga-systems,
the system of the Pāsupatas, the Vedānta and the system
of the Pāñcharātras ({#pASupataM vedASca#}--sic--{#pAYcarAtrakam#}),
for these are the five doctrines; the auspicious verse Gā-

<div n="P">Another account of a royal inauguration, which is si-
milar to that of the Agni-Purāṇa and perhaps belongs to
a still more recent period than the latter, is that of the
{%Mānasāra,%} a work on Architecture and reputedly the com-
pletest of its kind. [The high antiquity which is ascribed
by the Hindus to this work will become more than doubt-
ful, from a comparison, for instance, of this portion of it
with the 209<sup>th</sup> ch. of the Agni-P. The only Ms. of this
work, I could consult, is hopelessly incorrect and does
not permit to make a reliable translation of it; it is a copy
[Page284-b+ 56]
of an ancient Ms. in Tamul characters which was discovered
at Trichinopoly, is imperfect at the beginning and at the
end, was written out under the direction of Mr. Ch. P.
Brown and is now in possession of the E. I. H.; its ex-
treme rareness in India as well as in Europe makes it ad-
viseable to draw attention to some particulars of its de-
scription of a royal inauguration which may be rendered
in a safe manner.] The {%Mānasāra%} puts forward two per-
sonages in the inauguration ceremony who do not make
their appearance in the foregoing accounts: the {%Sthapati%} or
the architect, and the {%Sthāpaka%} or (probably) the master
of the ceremonies. According to this work, the throne is
placed in a handsome sacrificial building where the inau-
guration takes place ({#yAgamaRqape sOmye tu siMhAsanasya co-#}
{#pari . nfpAlaM tatra saMsTApya aBizekaM samAraBet;#} some such
building seems to be implied also by the description of the
Agni-Purāṇa, since a ‘door-keeper’ is mentioned, but it
is not expressedly named); the inauguration liquid, which
consists of river and sea-water is consecrated by chanting
hymns from the Atharvaveda, Sāmaveda and other sacred
works; ({#saritsamudrasalilakumBEH pUrRavimADavEH#} ({%sic%}) {#. aTarva-#}
{#sAmagItESca cAnyEScAgamamantrakEH#}); the king marks his fore-
head with the sign Tripuṇḍra (q. v.: {#paScAttu homanizWAM ca#}
{#darBaM dattvA tripuRqrakam . lalAwasAraRaM kuryAdBUpatistu yaTAvi-#}
{#Di#}), anoints his body with sandal and saffron, and the
{%Sthapati%} purifies him with the compound called {%Pancha-%}
{%gavya%} (see above page 282{%b,%} line 45); them the family-priest
places on his head the tiara, and this toilet being com-
pleted, the {%Sthapati%} and the {%Sthāpaka%} invite the king to
take place, with his queen, on the throne when the sacred
liquid is sprinkled on his forehead while he bears the
jewelled tiara ({#ratnasaMtuzwamukuwamUrDvaM rAjopaDArayet#}). This
ceremony having been performed under ‘benedictions and
all manner of auspicious noises’ ({#sarvamaNgalaGozESca svastivA-#}
{#canapUrvavat#}) the king mounts on an elephant and, under the
sounds of a similar music, rides round his city, keeping
his right side towards it, and distributes gifts amongst the
spectators ({#kuryAdArohaRaM paScAdrAjA tvErAvatopari . nagarI-#}
{#pradakziRaM kuryAtsarvamaNgalaGozakEH#}). These gifts which consist
in corn and the like, cow's and other milk, weapons, and
generally in any thing whether auspicious or not, the king
should throw before himself and touch with his own hand,
for in doing so he will not merely acquire strength, victory
and glory but abundance of food &c. [A modern treatise on
the royal inauguration, called {%Rājyābhiṣekapaddhati,%}--with-
out either date or name of the author--is very prolix in the
enumeration of the mantras; it quotes the {%Śatapathabr.%} and,
among the Purāṇas, chiefly the {%Agni-P.;%} but it is rather
an uncritical compilation from various books, than an au-
thoritative source of information.]
<div n="P">The {%time of the inauguration%} must be an auspicious one.
{%Rāma%} was inaugurated when the moon entered the asterism
{%Pushya,%} in the hour {%Abhijit;%} ({%Yuddhak.:%} {#tataH praBAte vimale#}
{#muhUrte'Bijiti praBuH . vasizWaH puzyayogena brAhmaREH parivA-#}
{#ritaH . rAmaM ratnamaye pIWe…upaveSya#} &c.).--The {%Agni-P.%}
merely forbids the inauguration to take place at night
[Page285-a+ 56]
time, but makes no further restriction ({#sAMvatsaro nfpaM kAle#}
{#sasaMBAro'Bizecanam . kuryAdfte rAtrikAlaM kAlasya niyamaH#}
{#smftaH#}).--According to the astrological work {%Jyotishara-%}
{%tnamālā,%} the inauguration of a king may take place when
the moon enters either of the following asterisms: {%Anu-%}
{%rādhā%} (17<sup>th</sup> ), {%Hasta%} (13<sup>th</sup> ), {%Pushya%} (8<sup>th</sup> ), {%Rohiṇi%} (4<sup>th</sup> ), {%Śra-%}
{%vaṇa%} (23<sup>d</sup> ) and the three next to it (viz. {%Dhaniṣṭhā, Śata-%}
{%bhiṣā, Pūrvabhādrapadā%}), {%Revatī%} (28<sup>th</sup> ), {%Mṛgaśiras%} (5<sup>th</sup> )
or {%Aśvinī%} (1<sup>st</sup> ); ({#mEtraSAkrakarapuzyarohiRIvEzRavezu tisfzUttarAsu#}
{#ca . revatImfgaSiro'SvinIzvapi kzmABujAM samaBizeka izyate#}).--
Another astrological work, the {%Muhūrtachintāmaṇī,%} lays
down the following rules: ‘the inauguration of a king is
auspicious, if it takes place at the period of the sun's pro-
gress to the north of the equator, when Jupiter, the Moon
and Venus have risen or those powerful planets: Mars, the
Sun, the predominant or the minor planet which rule the
(king's) nativity; but {%not%} on the fourth, ninth or fourteenth
day of the month Chaitra, on a Tuesday, during the night
or in an intercalary month. If it is performed at the
conjunction of ill-omened planets with the first asterism
(reckoned from that under which the king is born) their
influence brings him illness; with the eighth, death; with
the fifth, affliction of his sons; with the twelfth, poverty;
with the tenth, it deprives him of energy; with the seventh
or fourth, it destroys his sovereign power. All is au-
spicious, however, if an auspicious planet enters into the
circle. If Jupiter enters into conjunction with the ninth
or fifth asterism (reckoned from that under which the king
is born) or Mars with the sixth, or Venus with the tenth,
the king will always enjoy royal happiness; if Saturn
enters into conjunction with the third, the Sun with the
eleventh or Jupiter with the tenth or fourth asterism (and
the inauguration then takes place), his empire will remain
firm’; [{#rAjABizekaH SuBa uttarAyaRe gurvinduSukrEruditErbalA-#}

<div n="P">{%B.%} INAUGURATION OF A MILITARY COMMANDER. This
ceremony, the object of which is to ensure to the chief of
an army victory over his enemies, does not appear to have
been performed before the period of the {%Mahābhārata,%}
where the inauguration of {%Kārtikeya%} as commander of the
divine hosts is mentioned as the type of such a rite; comp.
e. g. the words addressed by {%Duryodhana%} to {%Śalya,%} the king
of Madra, when he chose him for his military chief: {#sEnA-#}

ceedings at such an inauguration are not fully detailed in
the description given in the {%Śalyaparvan%} of the {%Mahābh.%}
(ch. 46), of the inauguration of {%Kārtikeya;%} but from the
[Page285-b+ 56]
rites which are mentioned, it may be inferred, that they
were substantially the same as those which took place
at the inauguration of a king; (comp. e. g.: {#tato'Bizeka-#}

{#jaleSvaram . taTAByaziYcadBagavAnbrahmA lokapitAmahaH#} &c.); the
text (as results from the last quotation) professes at least
that they are analogous to those at the inauguration
of {%Varuṇa%} as king of the waters, and at the latter cere-
mony (mentioned {%Śalyap.%} chap. 48) reference is made to the
inauguration of {%Indra,%} which is the type of a royal inau-
guration; ({#varuRaM devatAH sarvAH sametyedamaTAbruvan . yaTAsmA-#}

have been that difference, however, that the military com-
mander, his installation having been performed, did not
give but receive presents, for the {%Mahābh.%} exhibits a long
list of presents that were offered to {%Kārtikeya%} by the gods
who assisted at his consecration.--The time deemed au-
spicious or inauspicious is the same for the inauguration
of a military chief as for that of a king, except that {%Tuesday%}
is considered also amongst the lucky days of the former,
Mars being himself a military chief; (according to {%Daiva-%}

<div n="P">5. Washing the image of a divinity, purifying it with
ablutions. This ceremony takes place either at a festival
[Page286-a+ 56]
held in honour of a divinity or at the installation of an
idol as a domestic and tutelary divinity; it consists in
rubbing it over with ointments and washing it with liquids
prepared of different substances under the recital of appro-
priate mantras. (According to the given quotation from
the {%Agni-Pur.,%} the invocations mentioned in the latter, are
the same for the consecration of an idol as for that of a
king.) At the {%Dola%} festival held in honour of the juvenile
{%Kṛṣṇa%} the following materiels are used, according to the
{%Utkalakhaṇḍa%} (as quoted by {%Rādhākāntadeva%}): cold water,
cow-dung, cow's urine, cow's milk, curds, clarified butter
(i. e. the five substances of the Panchagavya), infusions of
Kuśa-grass ({#kuSodakam#}), of Śaṅkha (a perfume, apparently
a dried shell-fish; {#SaNKodakam#}), of sandal ({#candanodakam#}),
of saffron ({#kuNkumodakam#}), of fruits and flowers ({#Paloda-#}
{#kam#} and {#puzpodakam#}), an unguent prepared of the powder
of sandal wood and of emblic myrobalan ({#candanapizwAma-#}
{#lakyudvartanam#}); scented water ({#suganDijalam#}) with which the
idol is washed eight times, milk, clarified butter and honey
being added severally at the second, seventh and eighth
ablution; an infusion of perfumes ({#ganDodakam#}) with which
five ablutions are made; water taken from places of pil-
grimage ({#tIrTajalam#}), Ganges-water, water proceeding from
an ant-hill, infusion of small annuals ({#sarvOzaDijalam#}),
Sahasradhārā-water ({#sahasraDArAjalam#}), various kinds of
water in jars (according to some, in 108 jars).--At the
{%Durgā%} festival, according to the {%Vṛhannandikeśvara-Purāṇa%}
(also quoted by {%Rādhāk.%}) the image of the goddess is rubbed
over before a looking glass ({#darpaRapratibimbe#}) with an oint-
ment prepared of turmeric and powder of emblic myro-
balan and then washed with the following things one after
the other, under the recital of mantras, with: pure water,
an infusion of Śaṅkha, Ganges-water, an infusion of per-
fumes, each article of the Panchagavya (successively, as
mentioned before), an infusion of Kuśa-grass, Pañchāmṛta
(a mixture of milk, curds, sugar, clarified butter and honey),
ice-water, honey, an infusion of flowers, sea-water mixed
with the juice of the sugar-cane ({#ikzurasasAgarodake#}), an
infusion of small and large annuals mixed together ({#sarvO-#}

seventh ({#sarvatIrTAmbupUrRa°#}) and pure water in an eighth jar
{#SudDajalapUrRAzwamakalasaH#}). Besides these substances, other ri-
tual works mention: river-water, infusions of cocoa-nuts and
of (pounded) pearls, rain-water, infusions of camphor and
of sandal, aloe, gold, silver, {%Gorochanā,%} saffron, {%Śrīphala,%}
corn, Dūb-grass, sugar, lake-water, Ganges-and sea-water
mixed together, an infusion of five kinds of grain ({#paYca-#}

ing to some, earth stirred up by the teeth of an elephant,
earth from a river, from its two banks, from a town-gate
({#nAgaramfttikA#}), from a cowpen and a trivium; others
name infusions of the five articles of Pañchāmṛta severally,
of the small and the large annuals severally ({#savOzaDi-#}
{#mahOzaDI pfTak#}), of the five kinds of extracts severally, or
infusions only of two articles of the Pañchāmṛta (viz.
honey, butter and milk excepted); again some name an
ointment made of turmeric only, some one prepared of
sesamum-oil and turmeric, and others add an aromatic
powder and one made of five kinds of grain. In the ritual
works founded on the {%Kālī-%} and {%Devī-Purāṇas%} there are men-
tioned, besides, infusions of (pounded) corals, emeralds, ru-
bies, pearls, lapis lazuli, several varieties of lotusses ({#padma,#}
{#kahlAra, kumuda#}), of sugar-cane, lac ({#alaktaka#}), red sandal,
turmeric, flour, rice and white mustard, as well as pool-
water and water from various places of pilgrimage; earth
from five such places; oil made of the Viṣṇu plant, an
ointment made of emblic myrobalan together with sesamum-
oil and turmeric.--The ritual works founded on the
{%Purāṇas%} mention moreover eight melodies which are se-
verally played when the idol is washed with the eight kinds
of water in the eight jars (see above col. {%a,%} line 43), as
well as the instruments with which they are played. At
the washing with the atmospheric water the melody is (acc.

({#devapratizWA#}) the following articles are recommended for
the ablution by the {%Devapratiṣṭhatattva%} (as quoted by
{%Rādhāk.%}): river-, torrent-, sea-, cascade- and cloud-water,
a mixture of milk, curds, sugar, clarified butter and honey,
{%Panchagavya%} mixed with an infusion of Kuśa-grass; earth
stirred up by the hoofs of a horse and the teeth of an ele-
phant, earth from a mountain, from Kuśa-grass and an
ant-hill, sesamum-oil, clarified butter, an infusion of five
extracts ({#paYcakazAyodakam#}), flowers of the mango-tree, of
the {%Champaka%} (Michelia champaca), of the Acacia suma,
lotusses and Oleander; leaves of holy basil, jasmin and
{%Śṛphala%} (Ægle marmelos.), a cleansing powder prepared
either of the refuse of Sesamum ({#tilakalka#}), or of rice
({#SAlitaRqula#}), or of {%Vilwa%} (Ægle marmelos.) -leaves, or of
emblic myrobalan ({#Amalaka#}); hot water, water from places
of pilgrimage. To prepare the liquid either a hundred and
eight, or fifty four, or twenty jars are required, or one
jar may suffice; the water is taken in the proportion of
a hundred and eight Pala-weight--such is the vaidik (!)
quantity--or, commonly, in the proportion of three
hundred and sixty Tola-weight, and the substances named
are mixed and shaken with it in each jar separately.--
If a person, however, cannot afford to provide all these
articles, he may take merely earth from an ant-hill, new
cowdung, dry cowdung, some water mixed with ashes and
scented water. (Comp. {%Rādhāk., Śabdak.%} s. v.).--E. {#sic#}

according to {%Harisvāmin,%} on the first day of the second

day of the first or light fortnight of the month Phālguna
(February-March); it consists of several ceremonies which
last five days, the first or {#dIkzA#} occupying one day, the
{#upasad#} offerings three days and the {#sutyA#} one day. The
officiating priest who performs the initiatory rites and
chants the Sāmav.-hymns specified in {%Maśaka'%}s {%Kalpasūtras,%}
must be a Brāhmaṇa of the family of {%Bhṛgu.%} The principal
ceremonies of this sacrifice (in which seem to have originated
those of the {#aBizeka#} q. v.) are the following: after the
initiatory rites have been performed and the {%Adhwaryu%}
priest has summoned the king who performs the Rājasūya
sacrifice, in proclaiming his name, the name of his father
and mother and that of his kingdom, he takes seventeen
kinds of liquid with vessels made of {%Udumbara%} (Ficus glo-
merata) wood, viz. he takes 1. water of the river Sarasvatī,
which he places in a well screened place; 2. having pro-
vided himself with as much clarified butter as is sufficient
for a full libation and gone into a pond, and having sent
there a man or a beast, he pours into the first wave which
is roused by either of them in an eastern direction, the
clarified butter and then takes the water of that wave; 3. he
repeats the same process with the second wave which is
roused in a western direction; 4. he then takes river-water
[Page288-a+ 56]
in the direction with the stream and 5. against the stream,
6. river-water which has broke out and formed a separate
stream, 7. sea-water, 8. water from a whirlpool, 9. water from
a deep lake, 10. water proceding from rain during sunshine,
before it has fallen down, 11. water from small tanks, 12. well-
water, 13. ice- or dew-water; ({%Śrīdeva%} observes that it must
be collected in places where there is much dry grass,
by throwing a clean garment over it and afterwards by
wringing it out in a cup); 14. honey, 15. water proceeding
from the membranes investing the fœtus of a cow which
has calved, 16. milk, 17. clarified butter; ({%Śrīdeva%} observes
that the water of the Sarasvatī and all water which is not
at hand as well as the water which can only be had con-
ditionally, e. g. that of 10. 13 15., must be first procured and
then the other kinds). He then catches, at it were, sun beams
with the hollow of his hand and joins them with each of the
seventeen liquids while repeating severally the hymns he
has recited before, when collecting each water. Then, he
pours these liquids into one vase made of {%Udumbara-%}
wood, arranges four vases made severally of {%Palāśa%}-(Butea
frondosa), {%Udumbara-,%} the pendant branch of the {%Ficus%}
{%Indica-,%} and {%Aśvattha-%} (Ficus religiosa) wood, spreads
out before them a tiger-skin and distributes the water col-
lected in the one vase, into the four sacrificial vases. Next
follows the toilet of the king who takes off the garments
he wore at the preparation for the sacrifice, and now is
clad by the Adhwaryu in a silk under garment and over
it in a red and white cloak; on his head the priest places
the royal turban ({%uṣṇīṣa%}), fastening both its ends to his
waist; and in his hands the bow, which he strings, and
three arrows. Then he throws copper into the face of a
long-haired eunuch who sits in the midst of the assembly and
represents the various kinds of death. These rites having been
performed, the Adhwaryu invites the king to step on the
tiger-skin, placing under his feet a golden circle and another
golden circle perforated with nine or a hundred holes on his
head; then he lifts up the arms of the king, and while the
latter is thus standing with his face towards the east, either he
or the royal family priest drops the contents of the Palāśa
vase over him; then the king's brother drops over him the
water contained in the Udumbara vase; then a Kshatriya
friend the water in the third vase, and lastly a Vaiśya
the water in the Aśvattha vase. The Hotṛ then having
recited the legend of Śunaḥśepa, the king gives to the
Adhwaryu and to him severally a hundred or a thousand
cows as well as gold, food and cloth; he then rubs the
consecrated water which remains on his body, over himself
with a black-horn-brush, makes three steps on the tiger-
skin at the hand of the Adhwaryu, and having poured the
remainder of the consecrated liquid into the Palāśa vase
hands it to his favourite son. After a libation of clarified
butter the Adhwaryu then proclaims the name of the king
coupling with it, however, this time the name of the son
(by saying e. g. ‘here is Daśaratha, the father of Rāma’).
The subsequent ceremonies refer to the preparation of a
carriage, the putting to it of a team of horses &c., the
[Page288-b+ 56]
giving of cows to the king's brother, the king's mounting
the car, tying on his feet a pair of shoes made of boar's
skin, giving to his bow-bearer the bow with the three ar-
rows and after various other rites, playing a game of shells,
five shells having been handed to him by the Adhwaryu,
with his brother, his charioteer ({%sūta%}) or his architect ({%stha-%}
{%pati%}) and his military chief, the shells being either made
of gold, or the fruits of Beleric myrobalan serving as such
({%Sāyaṇa%} on the {%Śatap.:%} {#akzA nAma kapardakAH suvarRanirmitAH .#}
{#viBItakaPalAni sOvarRA vetyeke#}) and the game representing
the victory of the Kali age over the other ages; the cere-
mony closes with libations in the fire. (The Mīmānsists
do not consider the recital of the legend of Śunaḥśepa and
the game of shells as special parts of the Abhiṣechanīya,
but as rites belonging in general to the whole Rājasūya
sacrifice. For the full detail of the ceremony and the
hymns to be recited at the various rites see {%Śatapathabr.%}

defines this character which is of frequent occurrence in
poetry and affords an insight into the amorous customs
of the ancient Hindus, as ‘a woman who, having lost all

invites her paramour to come to her (as quoted by {%He-%}

by {%Vallabhagaṇi:%} {#madena ca--. aBisArayate#}--{%Vallabh.:%}

who cannot even wait for the arrival of the messenger she
has sent out, but suffers unbearable pains of thirst after
the water of love, desirous as she is to drink the lips of her
absent friend’ ({%Vetalapanch.:%} {#yA dUtikAgamanakAlamapArayantI#}

him to meet her’ ({#lajjAM hitvA samAkfzwA yOvanena madena ca .#}
{#aBisArayate kAntaM kIrtitA sABisArikA#}); but if we follow
other works on Hindu rhetoric, this definition would only
apply to the second or the last of the three categories of the
{#aBisArikA,#} as mentioned e. g. by the {%Sāhityadarpaṇa%} and the
{%Saṅgītadāmodara;%} the former of which works, after having
prefaced the definition that ‘wise men call {%abhisārikā%} a woman

tinguishes between gentle-women who go to meet their lovers,
courtesans and servant girls; ‘the gentle-woman will make
herself on such occasions as small as possible, deafen the
noise of her ornaments and wrap herself up in a veil; the
courtesan will make a display of gay apparel, her ankle-
ornaments will merrily tinkle and her face smile with joy;
if a servant girl goes to meet her lover, her speech will
stammer with delight, her eyes stare wide open with flurry,
and her gait will be awkwardly bewildered’ ({%Sāhityad.:%}

But the rhetorico-musical work {%Saṅgītadāmodara%} is appa-
rently more in keeping with the general division of amorous
ladies (see {#nAyikA#}) into such as are their own mis-
tresses, or such as belong to another (as a married
woman and a maiden) and such as belong to every body
(comp. {#svastrI, anyastrI#} and {#sADAraRastrI#}), when it sub-
stitutes for the servant girl the second category; for its
story runs thus: ‘the gentle-woman goes to the lover's
house wrapped up, afraid, bashful, concealing her emotions,
confused (?), with downcast looks; a married woman will
go to him her speech somewhat stammering, her eye glaring
wide open with flurry, her gait awkwardly bewildered,
with slow steps, and no one will see her; but a courtesan
walks up to her lover in the company of a friend, full
of passion, her eyes trembling, fearless, decorated with
all kind of ornaments, surrounded by people, with tinkling
anklets: (in short) just as she pleases’. This work tells
us besides that some of these ladies prefer assignations
during the light half of a month, i. e. from new to full
moon,--hence called {#SuklABisArikAH#} or dames of the
light fortnight--and others during the dark half, when
the moon is in the wane--hence called {#kfzRABisArikAH#}
or dames of the dark fortnight; the former wear garlands
of Arabian jasmine, are anointed all over with Sandal
preparations and dressed in silk, but do not make their
appearance by moon-light; the latter are anointed with
black aloe unguents, are fond of dark colours, and are
also afraid of the moon-rise; ({#kulajAnyANganA veSyA triDA#}

the manner described, is exhibited in the {%Sāhityadarpaṇa:%} her
betel-stained teeth she always displays; with horse laughter
she laughs, but no one knows why; from place to place
she sets, to please, her staggering steps, and dancing high
her hips, she slily stops before young men’.] The best
time for {%abhisārikās%} to meet their lovers is, according to
the {%Saṅgītad.,%} ‘during a dense fog, a winter-night, com-
plete darkness, at noon of a summer-day, while a whirl-
wind rages, during an uproar, at moon-rise, during a re-
volution, when the king is ill, or the town is on fire, during
a great festival, and in the evening’, for it seems ‘that on
such occasions the cowkeeper girls as well as the dames of
the dark as those of the light fortnight had their amatory
sport with Kṛṣṇa’; (but their meeting at moon-rise is
apparently at variance with the preceding definition; {#sPA-#}

Manu (X. 15.) the {%Abhīra%} is of mixed origin, the offspring
of a Brāhmaṇa father and a mother of the Ambashtha or
medical caste; but the {%Abhīras%} were a people, a pastoral
tribe, settled about the beginning of the Christian era, on
or near the lower course of the Indus on a tract known to
classical geographers, as the {%Abiria%} of Ptolemy, lying north
of the Sahyadri mountain and of Syrastrene. The {%Abhīras%}
of Saurāṣtra are mentioned in the Mahābhārata. From
their pastoral habits the name came to be generally applied
to the cowherds of Hindustan. In the spoken dialects of
upper India the word is corrupted to Ahīr, Uheer; in Ben-
gālī and Marāṭhī it is unchanged, occurring as Abhīr.’

547. 553. 592. 792. 855. 953. 956. &c.--The word as a
name of a people occurs in the Purāṇas ‘always conjoined
with the {%Śūdras,%} as if conterminous’ ({%Wilson'%}s {%Viṣṇu-P.%}
p. 195 n. 154).--The {%Sāhityadarpaṇa%} mentions the {%Abhīras%}
as assistants appointed in, or belonging to, the harem
(together with dwarfs, eunuchs, Kirātas or mountaineers,
Mlechchhas or barbarians, the mock-brother-in-law of a
king, i. e. the brother of his concubine, hump-backs, mutes
&c.: {#vAmanazaRqakirAtamlecCABIrAH SakArakubjAdyAH#}). The
same work, in defining the purposes for which Sanskṛt
and the Prākṛt-dialects are used in the dramatic dialogue,
appropriates the dialect of the Abhīras (which therefore is
not considered by the {%Sāh.%} as an Apabhranśa-dialect) to
cowherds and woodcutters; comp. {#ABIrI#} s. v. {#ABIra;#}
{#(ABIrezu taTABIrI…. ABIrI SAvarI cApi kAzWa-#}

its being a synonyme of {#reRukA#} to the authority of the

perhaps by an omission of a copyist of the {%Śabdachandrikā.%}
The latter vocabulary has been composed by {%Chakrapāṇi-%}
{%datta%} with a view of being a supplement to the {%Amarak.;%}
it does not contain as much matter as this vocabulary nor
does it follow {%throughout%} its order; but in certain portions it
{%has%} the same order and it gives always literally the text of
the {%Amarak.,%} wherever additional synonymes have been
intended by the author, these synonymes being either im-
mediately annexed by him to the words of the {%Amarak.%}
in a subsequent verse or pointed out through the repetition
of the word to be enlarged upon, which then is put in the
locative. The end of the enumeration is marked by the
repetition of the word synonymized, between two full stops.

{#Bojya#} to that of {#Bakzya#} (‘fit to serve as solid food’) or used
{#Bakzya#} in the general acceptation of {#aByavahArya#}. {%Patanjali,%} it

casion by alleging {#abBakza#} and {#vAyuBakza#} in evidence that {#Bakz#}
(and, impliedly, that {#Bakzya#}) are used in a general sense;
but on another occasion when he shows that there are
words the bearing of which in the classical language can
merely be established from the context in which they occur
in the vaidik literature, and not be made out otherwise (see
{#ekapada#}), he gives these very instances as a proof of his
latter assertion, and admitting therefore that they belong to
this exceptional category, corroborates thus involuntarily
the view of {%Kātyāy.%} that {#Bakz#} cannot be applied to the word
{#ap#} in a {%general sense,%} and much less to any other word
having the sense of a liquid substance ({%Patanj. Introd.:%}

would reconcile the observations he makes in his Introd.,

not mean the {#DAtu,#} but the {#aNga#} of these radicals, espe-
cially as he treats of the rules concerning the {#aByasta,#} in
the chapter on {#aNga#} (VI. 4. 1. to the end of the seventh
book). The same inaccuracy of supplying the word {#DAtu,#}
instead of {#aNga,#} has been frequently committed by the same
Paṇḍits in the last named chapter (e. g. VII. 4. 69. 73. 84. 85.

({%Śr. Sūtr.%} XV. 1. 4.--3. 46.) on the text of the {%Śatapathabr.%}
(V. 2. 3. 1.--3. 2. 8.) and, among the Sūtra-authors, gives

the proceedings connected with but following the {%Abhyāroh.,%}
viz. with the {%Pūrṇāhuti%} &c.; ({%Sāy.:%} {#tatra#}--i. e. {#rAjasUye--#}

mences on the first day of the first or light fortnight of the
month Phālguna (February-March) and lasts eight days, the
{%four%} first of which are occupied by the {%Dīkṣā%} or initiatory
rites, the {%three%} following by the {%Upasad%}-offerings (q. v.)
and the {%eighth%} by the {%Sutyā%} (q. v.; {%Yājnik. Paddh.:%} {#caturdI-#}
{#kzastryupasatka ekasutyaH pavitrasaMjYakaH somayAgo'gnizwomasaMsTaH#});
the presents given to the priests are a thousand cows; in the
choice of the priests, the buying of the Soma &c. it con-
forms itself, as is said before, to the rules of the Agni-
ṣṭoma.--The rites connected with this sacrifice and
following it, are: on the {%ninth%} day the {%Pūrṇāhuti%} or a liba-
tion of a ladle-full of butter, in the house of the sacrificer,
if he wishes it;--the present he makes on this occasion,
being left to his own liberality. ({%Harisvāmin%} adds the
following details, which may serve as an instance: the
Adhwaryu takes first the Āhavanīya fire out; four seats
are prepared; the choice of the Brahman is made silently;
[Page316-a+ 56]
the Adhw. sits silently down at the right side of the Brahman
and the sacrificer, prepares the clarified butter, cleans the
ladles {%Sruch%} and {%Sruva%} and takes with the {%Sruva%} as much
butter as is necessary to fill the {%Sruch;%} then he proceeds
with fuel and the {%Sruch%} to the fire, sits down, puts the
fuel on and in saying svāhā! sacrifices the butter with the
words: ‘this to Agni, this to Prajāpati’; then the sacri-
ficer gives the present to the Adhwaryu.) The principal
ceremonies after this libation are: on the following or {%tenth%}
day the burnt sacrifice of a Puroḍāśa fried in eight bowls,
under the recital of {%Vājas.%} 9. 35., to Anumati (q. v.), when
the present to the priest is a garment; on the {%eleventh%} day
the sacrifice of a Puroḍāśa fried in eleven bowls, to Agni
and Viṣṇu, the present being gold; on the {%twelfth%} day, of
a Puroḍāśa, also fried in eleven bowls, to Agni and Soma,
the present: a cow which has been several times liberated,
(liberation being the object to be effectuated by this gift);
on the {%thirteenth%} day, of a Puroḍāśa fried in twelve bowls,
when the priest receives a bull; on the {%fourteenth%} day, an
{%Āgrayaṇeṣṭi%} (q. v.) accompanied with the gift of a cow.--
The next four sacrifices are those which constitute the
{%Chāturmāsya%} ceremonies, viz. the {%Vaiśvadeva, Varuṇapra-%}
{%ghāsa, Sākamedha%} and {%Śunasīrya%} (qq. vv.); they are per-
formed during four successive months but so that the com-
mencement of the {%Śunasīrya%} falls on the same day on which
the Dīkṣā of the Abhyārohanīya had begun in the pre-
ceding year. The rite on the {%first%} day of the Śunasīrya is
the {%Pañchavatīya%} (q. v.), viz. a libation of butter under
special injunctions and accompanied by the muttering of
the verses {%Vāj.%} 9. 35. and 37., (performed esp. when the king
suffers from a painful disease, since it will give him relief);
the present is a cart with three horses. There follows on the
{%second%} day the {%Indraturīya%} which consists of four libations,
viz. a libation of {%Havis%} fried in eight bowls, to Agni,--
of {%Charu%} made of barley, to Varuṇa,--of Charu made
of gavedhuka-rice, to Rudra,--of curds proceeding from
the milk of a cart-cow, to Indra; and this cow is then
offered to the priest as a present. The sacrifice on the
then following, or {%third,%} day is the {%Apāmārgahoma,%} which
serves also to break the spell of incantatory rites performed
by an enemy and to turn them against himself, and the
peculiarities of which are therefore described with some
detail by {%Kāty.%} and the commentator; it seems to be barren
for the Adhwaryu, for no present is mentioned. The next
in order are the {%Trishamyukta%}-libations in three divisions:
first, Puroḍāśa fried in eleven bowls, to Agni and Viṣṇu,
Charu to Indra and Viṣṇu, and Charu or Puroḍāśa fried
in three bowls to Viṣṇu;--the present is a short bull or
cow; secondly on the following day, Puroḍāśa fried in
eleven bowls, to Agni and Pūṣan, Charu to Indra and
Pūṣan, and Charu to Pūṣan, the present: a black bull
or cow; thirdly on the following day, Puroḍāśa fried in
eleven bowls, to Agni and Soma, Charu to Indra and
Soma, and Charu to Soma, the present: a tawny bull or
cow; on the next day Puroḍāśa fried in twelve bowls is
offered to Viśvānara, and Charu made of barley to Va-
[Page316-b+ 56]
ruṇa, or the latter libation is spared for a separate, the
following day; in such a case the present given to the
priest for the libation to Viśvānara is a bull, and for that
to Varuṇa, a black garment, or if such a garment cannot
be had, one that is not black. [The Śunasīrya and the
other ceremonies would therefore comprise seven, or if the
two last are performed on one day, six days; and the cere-
mony to be mentioned presently, the {%Ratnahavis,%} would be-
gin on the eighth or seventh day after the Śunasīrya. Such
is the rule of the {%Kāṇva%} school, but {%Harisvāmin%} despatches
the {%Indraturīya, Apāmārgahoma%} and the three {%Trishamyukta%}
on the day after the Śunasīrya, and puts the Viśvānara-
and Varuṇa-libations on the third, or the Viśvānara-lib.
on the third and the Varuṇa-lib. on the fourth day, with
the further remark that, according to the option in the per-
forming of the latter rites, the beginning of the next fol-
lowing, the {%Ratnahavis,%} would come to fall either on the
third or on the fourth day. This difference between the
two schools, as regards the time of the performance of these
rites, continues therefore in what follows.] The rites next
in order are twelve libations called {%Ratnahavis%} (q. v.) which
are performed on twelve successive days in twelve different
houses, whereto the sacrificer repairs for this purpose on
each following day, with the {%Gārhapatya%} and {%Āhavanīya%}
fire placed on the two {%Araṇis;%} viz. a libation of 1. Puroḍāśa
fried in eight bowls, to Agni Anīkavat, in the house of
the {%Senānī%} or commander in chief; 2. Charu to Bṛhaspati,
in the house of the {%Purohita%} or family priest; 3. Puroḍāśa
fried in eleven bowls to Indra, in the house of the {%Yaja-%}
{%māna%} or the king for whom all these proceedings take
place; 4. Charu to Aditi, in the h. of the {%Mahiṣī%} or his
first and principal wife; 5. Charu (made of barley) to Va-
ruṇa in the h. of the {%Sūta%} or the master of the horse
({%Yājnik.:%} = {#aSvasAraTiH;#} {%Hariśv.:%} = {#aSvapozaka#}); 6. Puro-
ḍāśa fried in eight bowls, to the Maruts, in the h. of the
{%Grāmaṇī%} or mayor ({%Yājnik.:%} = {#grAmanetA vESyAnAM mahattaraH#});
7. Puroḍāśa fried in twelve or eight bowls, to Savitṛ, in
the h. of the {%Kṣattṛ%} or goldstick-in-waiting (at the same
time the overseer of the harem and confidential messenger;
({%Sāy.:%} {#kzattA nAma yazwihasto'ntaHpurADyakzaH sarvezAM niyantA#}
{#pratihArAparaparyAyaH#}); 8. Puroḍāśa fried in two bowls, to
the Aśvins, in the h. of the {%Saṅgrahītṛ%} or the driver (who
stands on the left side of the king in his carriage); 9. Charu
to {%Pūṣan,%} in the h. of the {%Bhāgadugha%} or minister of the
revenue ({%Sāy.:%} {#rAjYaH prAptaM zazWaM BAgaM prajAByo gfhItvA rAjYe#}
{#dogDi prayacCatIti BAgaduGaH#}); 10. Charu made of Gave-
dhukas which have been fetched from the houses of the
overseer of the gambling halls ({%akṣavāpa%}) and of the {%govi-%}
{%kartṛ%} or (master of the) huntsmen (or acc. to others of a
ploughman), to Rudra, in the h. of the {%Yajamāna%} or sacri-
ficer; 11. Ājya or clarified butter taken four times, to Road
(personified as a divinity), in addressing it with the words
‘may Road liking the clarified butter partake of it ({%Śatap.%}
V. 3. 1. 11.)’, in the h. of the {%Dūta%} or messenger; 12. a
Darvihoma of Charu made of black rice which has been
unhusked with the finger-nails, under the recital of the
[Page317-a+ 56]
words {#eza--svAhA#} ({%Vājas.%} 9. 35.), or a simple Charu pre-
pared in the same manner under the recital of the same
words and a {%Vaṣaṭkāra,%} to Nirṛti, in the h. of a wife of
the king who has been left by him for want of having
borne him a son. The presents to the priests in the pre-
ceding twelve acts are severally (and in the given order):
1. gold, 2. a cow with a black back (or acc. to others with
a white back; see {#SitipfzWa#}), 3. a bull, 4. a milch-cow, 5. a
horse, 6. a spotted cow, 7. a red (or acc. to others, a white;
see {#Syeta#}) cart-ox, 8. two twin-cows or, if they cannot be
had, two cows, which are born one after the other, 9. a
cow with white and black hairs, 10. three presents (for the
lib. to Rudra), viz. a. either a cow with white thighs (acc.
to some, with black thighs) or one with a white tail (acc.
to some, with a black tail; see {#SitibAhu#} and {#Siti-#}
{#vAla#}), b. a dagger-sword, sharp and its point unbent,
(without a sheath), c. a vessel where gambling-dice are
thrown in, tied round with a cord made of hairs; 11. three
presents (for the lib. to Road), viz. a. a bow covered with
{%pyukṣṇas%} [which word is rendered by {%Sāy.:%} tendon, by
{%Yājnik.%} in reference to others: tail of a peacock, or skin
of a boa constrictor; the E. I. H. Ms. of the comm. to
{%Śatap.%} V. 3. 1. 11. and {%Weber'%}s ed. read {#ukzRa°#} for {#pyukzRa#}
which seems doubtful, though {#ukzRa#} is explained {#ukzavikAra#}],
b. a leather quiver with arrows, and c. a red turban; 12. a
black, old diseased cow.--Then the king tells his bar-
ren wife to go forth and out of his power, and she re-
pairs to the house of a Brāhmaṇa where the king has no
more any control over her.--After the {%Ratnahavis%} have
been completed, the (royal) sacrificer goes to his palace
and makes (apparently on the day of the twelfth Ratna-
havis) a libation of Charu which has been prepared in the
milk of a white cow which has had a white calf, to Soma
and Rudra; and the present he makes to the priest, is this
white cow; (this rite is performed esp. if the king suffers
from scabs or vitiligo). On the following day he makes a
libation of Charu to Mitra and Bṛhaspati, and makes to
the priest the gift of a cow. This libation which is also
the subject of special injunctions, closes the rites which are
connected with the Abhyārohaṇīya and are immediately
followed by those of the {%Abhiṣechanīya.%} [The {%Sāmaveda%}
school must have rejected the performance of the Śunāsīrya
and of all the following rites, since they place with distinct
words the beginning of the {%Abhiṣechanīya (v. s. v.)%} on the
same day of the following year on which, in the previous
year, the initiatory rite of the Abhyār. commenced, viz. on
the first day of the light fortnight of the month Phālguna,
i. e. on the same day when acc. to the {%Yajurveda%} school,
the Śunāsīrya would have to begin (e. g. {%Lātyāy. Śr. S.:%}
{#saMvatsarAdUrDvamaBizecanIyena yajeta tasminneva kAle;#} {%Agnisw.:%}

{#rohaRIyenezwam . PAlgunIpakzasya praTamAyAmiti#}); {%Harisvāmin%}
who seems to assign only a fortnight to the performance
of the rites from the Śunāsīrya to the last Charu-libation,
puts the Abhish. (as mentioned s. v.) on the first day of
[Page317-b+ 56]
the {%dark%} fortnight of the month Phālguna ({%Harisw.:%} {#PAlguna-#}
{#kfzRapratipadyaBizecanIyasya dIkzeta#}) in reading the {%Śrauta S.%}

{%Kāṇva%} school which is followed by {%Yājnikadeva,%} the com-
mentator of {%Kātyāy.,%} assigns a much longer duration to
these rites and places therefore the beginning of the {%Abhish.%}
(which circumstance I omitted to mention under {#aBizeca-#}

Chaitra (March-April), in reading the named Sūtra {#PAlgu-#}
