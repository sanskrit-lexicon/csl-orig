yat-meta2.txt
May 31, 2017. This supercedes yat-meta.txt as a description of 
 the current digitization yat.txt.
-  'meta' lines added to yat.txt.

yat.txt uses the utf-8 encoding for extended ASCII characters.

The {X...X} style of coding serves several purposes:
{#X#}    49906 : Devanagari, coded in SLP1 transliteration
{%X%}    1461 : italic text 
{??}     22 : unreadable text
{@X@}    1 : bold text. in a header

The following  <> type tags are found in yat.txt:
<>  24834  : start of new line (markup removed 12-16-2021)
<P>  166  :  start of new line
<H>  49  : Title line
<F>..</F>  2  : Footnote
<g></g>    1 : Greek text
<HS>        1 : In preface
<P>         6 : Paragraph break, in preface

Meta lines: 
Each entry of the digitization is contained within a beginning and ending
markup. As example,
<L>3<pc>001-a<k1>aMSa<k2>aMSa
{#aMSa#}¦ {#(t-ka) aMSayati#} 10. {%a.%} To se-
<>parate, to divide, to apportion.
<LEND>
The ending markup is <LEND>.
The beginning markup contains various identifying fields, expressed in
a <fieldname>fieldvalue format. The fields are:
required fields
  L Cologne record identifier
  pc page-col reference to scanned image
  k1 key1. The headword spelling, in slp1 coding for Sanskrit headwords
  k2 key2. The original headword spelling, either in slp1 or IAST

optional field for homonym
  hom The homonym number (usually a digit). Not present in yat dictionary

---------------------------------

Page breaks are coded as [Page...].
Pages are like [Page-X+nn], where X has one of several forms:
(a) -title-Y  (Y = ii, iii, iv)
(b) 908  (an intentially blank page, before addenda)
(c) Y    (with Y = 924-927; a page missing from pdf used for digitization)
(d) Y-C  where Y = 001 to 923 (except 908) and C = 'a' or 'b' (column)


The lines of the digitization represent lines of the text.

The headwords are ordered according to Sanskrit alphabet ordering.

The following is mentioned in Footnote on page 1:
"The dots beneath or between the letters distinguish or separate
<>the component parts of compound words, and so point out their deriva-
<>tion."
We have converted dots between letters to '-', and dots below letters to '_'.
These occur within Devanagari text.

Non-Devanagari Sanskrit in the body of the entries has been partially converted 
to IAST unicode, generally as described in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration. 

Here are the extended ASCII characters that occur in yat.txt,
with their approximate frequency.
