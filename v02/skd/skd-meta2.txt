skd-meta2.txt
August 23, 2017. This supercedes skd-meta.txt as a description of 
 the current digitization skd.txt.

The {X...X} style of coding serves one  in skd.txt:
{??} 13  : Unreadable text

The lines of the digitization correspond to lines of the printed text.
All of the text is Devanagari, which is currently coded in the SLP1 
transliteration in skd.txt.

The <> style of coding is used as follows:
<>   4424807  :  At beginning of 'normal' lines, other than the first line
                of an entry (Removed <> 12-15-2021)
<H>   158  : At start of line. A 'headline' (various usage)
<P>  1130  : At start of line, indicating a paragraph indentation
<Picture> 5 : Diagrams in text
The rest are 'Column' indicators for textual tabular arrays:
<C1>...<C11>

Meta lines: 
Each entry of the digitization is contained within a beginning and ending
markup. As example,
<L>2<pc>1-001<k1>a<k2>a
a¦, vya, aBAbaH . alpaH . nizeDaH . anukampA . iti
<>medinI . (naYo'yamakAraH zaqviDAn naYarTAn boDa-
<>yati . yaTA, --
 --ETC--
<LEND>

The ending markup is <LEND>.
The beginning markup contains various identifying fields, expressed in
a <fieldname>fieldvalue format. The fields are:
required fields
  L Cologne record identifier
  pc page-col reference to scanned image
  k1 key1. The headword spelling, in slp1 coding for Sanskrit headwords
  k2 key2. The original headword spelling, either in slp1 or IAST

optional field for homonym
  hom The homonym number (usually a digit). Not present in skd dictionary.

Page breaks are coded as [Page...].
Page breaks are more specifically coded as
[Page5-069-b+ 52] Volume 5, Page 069, column b (2nd col.), 52 lines in column.
Some variants of the '-b' part of this occur, for example
 [Page2-268+ 41] , where the usual 3-column form is broken by a table.
 [Page2-048-a1+ 13] , where  again a tabular display is shown.


The headwords are generally ordered according to Sanskrit alphabet ordering.

The introduction is not coded in skd.txt; it appears in the separate file
skd-title.txt.  The page breaks are coded as
[Page0-xxxETC] so that 0-xxx is as in file pdftitlefiles.txt, which
gives the correspondence to scanned image pages in skd_title.pdf.

There is no IAST coding of Sanskrit in skd.txt


There are several extended ascii codes in skd.txt.

£  (\u00a3)    24 := POUND SIGN
¤  (\u00a4)    12 := CURRENCY SIGN
¦  (\u00a6) 42196 := BROKEN BAR
      Note: This character appears on first line of the entry after
            the portion that was used to interpret the headword.
            It is an artifact of the digitization.
¯  (\u00af)     3 := MACRON
×  (\u00d7)     2 := MULTIPLICATION SIGN
‘  (\u2018)  1398 := LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK
’  (\u2019)  1350 := RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK
“  (\u201c) 53134 := LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK
”  (\u201d) 52816 := RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK
„  (\u201e)     3 := DOUBLE LOW-9 QUOTATION MARK
†  (\u2020)     1 := DAGGER
‡  (\u2021)     1 := DOUBLE DAGGER
…  (\u2026)   659 := HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS

Scanned images (in pdfs skd_title, skd1_bookmark, ..., skd5_bookmark) are
almost all from //archive.org downloads
sabdakalpadrumah01devauoft.pdf, ..., sabdakalpadrumah05devauoft.pdf.
However, a few (12) pages missing from these downloads were obtained from
the high-resolution scans used by Thomas Malten for digitization (ejf).
