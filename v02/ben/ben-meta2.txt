This file describes the coding conventions of ben.txt, which is the current
version of the Benfey digitization. For previous versions, see ben-meta.txt.

ben.txt uses the utf-8 encoding for extended ASCII characters.


The {X...X} style of coding serves several purposes:
{# #}  22319  : {#X#}  Sanskrit coded in SLP1 transliteration
{% %}  57590  : italic text. 
{@ @}  41385  : bold text.

The pseudo-xml <> style of coding is in two forms:
a) pseudo-xml coding in 'meta' lines
b) normal xml coding in the entries between the meta-lines.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Meta lines: 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<L>,<e>,<h>,<k1>,<k2>,<pc>,<LEND> are used in the 'meta lines':

Each entry of the digitization is contained within a beginning and ending
markup. As example,

<L>1<pc>0001-a<k1>a<k2>a
{#a'#}¦ {%a-,%} a negative prefix, corre-
sponding to the {%á-%} privative in Greek;
see {%an-,%}
<LEND>

The ending markup is <LEND>.
The beginning markup contains various identifying fields, expressed in
a <fieldname>fieldvalue format. The fields are:
required fields
  L Cologne record identifier
  pc page-col reference to scanned image
  k1 key1. The headword spelling, in slp1 coding for Sanskrit headwords
  k2 key2. The original headword spelling in slp1 
  h The homonym number (usually a digit). Not used in ben.txt
  e Not used in ben.txt
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
XML tags within entries
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A few xml tags are introduced as markup within the body of entries.
076325 <div n="lb"> : Beginning of normal lines. (Removed this markup 12-16-2021)
001513 <lang n="greek"></lang> : Greek text (not yet coded)
000001 <pic name='vatsa.png'/> : An image, under headword 'vatsa'

A few xml-type tags are used in parts of the digitization outside of entries.
000046 <H>  : Section header. (at letter breaks)
000593 <HI> : Appear only in the Additions and Corrections Section
000001 <NI> : Appears in Preface
000139 <P>  : Appears in Preface and  in the Additions and Corrections Section

Page breaks are coded as [Page...].
Page breaks are more specifically coded, in the body of the dictionary, as:
Coded in body of dictionary as:
[Pagepppp-c+ nn] where
pppp is the page number (0 filled) from 0001 to 1127.
c is the column: 'a' or 'b'
nn is the number of (following) lines in the page-column.
First is 0001-a, last is 1145-b

Page breaks in the preface have a different form, using Roman numerals,
 e.g. [PageIV-a+ 40]

The lines of the digitization correspond to the lines of the text.


Most Sanskrit in the text appears in the European Indological form, which
has been converted to IAST unicode,
 generally as described in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration. This differs in several respects from the
coding of the printed version.

Here are the extended ASCII characters that occur in ben.txt,
with their approximate frequency.  Although most of these appear within 
Sanskrit word, a few (e.g. ï) appear within words of other languages, and a few
(such as ¦) serve some specialized purpose.
